"Computerized detection and internet-based treatment of common mental disorders among college students in two Latin American LMICs PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Objectives: This proposal is submitted in response to PAR-18-835 to detect, engage, and experimentally evaluate the effects of internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (e-CBT) to treat college students in two Latin American LMICs with major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder w/ or w/o comorbid common mental disorders (CMDs). Detection and engagement will be based on inexpensive internet-based self-report surveys and the intervention on inexpensive e-CBT to address the low resources in LMICs. Knowledge transfer to the primary LMIC collaborating institution (Mexican National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente Muniz [INPRFM]) will be a goal designed to facilitate dissemination to LMIC colleges/universities throughout Latin America. The study will build on prior research by collaborators in the WHO World Mental Health (WMH) survey consortium and WMH International College Study (WMH-ICS) initiative documenting high prevalence, impairment, and unmet need for treatment of CMDs among college students around the world and significant effects of e-CBT in treating these disorders in high income countries. Specific aims/Design/Methods: First, we will carry out a pragmatic clinical trial with students seeking treatment for CMDs at student clinics in four universities in Colombia and Mexico. Students on waitlists for student clinic services will be offered a possibility of receiving guided e-CBT immediately while staying on the list. 50% of the students with CMD who express interest will be randomized to guided e-CBT and the other 50% to treatment as usual (TAU). Short-term aggregate intervention effects will be assessed 60 days after randomization and longer-term effects 12 months after randomization. We will then use ensemble machine learning methods to predict heterogeneity of treatment effects of guided e-CBT versus TAU and develop a precision treatment rule (PTR) to predict which students will respond best to which intervention. We will then implement a SMART design in which we randomize 50% to the treatment arm predicted to be optimal by the PTR and the other 50% to randomization across arms. Additionally, we will carry out annual WMH-ICS internet-based mental health needs assessment surveys with a probability sample of students to estimate unmet need for treatment and barriers to treatment. Students screening positive for CMD who are not in treatment and report resistance to in-person treatment will be randomized to guided e-CBT to determine if access to guided e-CBT reduces the unmet need for treatment among students with CMDs who fail to seek treatment at student health clinics. Finally, the technology for screening, delivering e-CBT, and updating the precision treatment model, implemented initially by Harvard Medical School, will be transferred to INPRFM for dissemination to universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. That many senior regional mental health policy makers are trained at INPRFM and return for periodic policy summits, coupled with the close working relationship of INPRFM with the Pan American Health Organization, bode well for such dissemination efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The research will provide valuable information to school administrators and government policy makers in the participating LMICs to document the burden of CMDs among university students, the extent of unmet need for treatment of these disorders, the effectiveness of inexpensive-scalable e-CBT interventions to treat these disorders, and for whom e-CBT is most effective. The technology transfer part of the study will build capacity to disseminate the methods used for screening, targeting, and intervention implementation so that they can be used in colleges and universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. Such an effort could have enormous public health implications for the region and serve as a model of evidence-based intervention planning and implementation for other parts of the world.",Computerized detection and internet-based treatment of common mental disorders among college students in two Latin American LMICs,10053143,R01MH120648,"['Address', 'Administrator', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Colombia', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Latin America', 'Latin American', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Pan American Health Organization', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Probability Samples', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Services', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'arm', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'college', 'common treatment', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'nervous system disorder', 'outreach', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'symposium', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trial design', 'undergraduate student', 'university student']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY,R01,2020,10000,-0.0015078173243237697
"Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients Failure to rescue (FTR), a nurse-sensitive national metric of health care quality, refers to death of a hospitalized patient from a treatable complication, and is potentiated by failure to recognize and appropriately respond to early signs of complications. There is a paucity of research examining patient features predictive of FTR complications. Such information could shift the current paradigm of nursing surveillance to earlier recognition, prevention and treatment of FTR complications, thereby saving lives. New-onset venous thromboembolism (VTE), an FTR complication occurring as either a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE), is the leading cause of preventable hospital death, carrying a high risk of mortality and a national cost burden of $7 billion annually. VTE is a complex disease process involving interactions between clinical risk factors and acquired and/or inherited susceptibilities to thrombosis. Although biomarkers and clinical factors associated with VTE have been identified, clinical manifestations are subtle, presenting gradually over hours to days. Current VTE risk assessment models (RAM), the cornerstone of prevention, have limited utility due to their complexity and lack of reliability, generalizability and external validation. A critical gap in VTE risk modeling research is that while new-onset VTE pathology evolves over the course of hospitalization, no current models incorporate the progressive accrual of dynamic patient data and pattern evolution over time in their modeling approaches. The totality of routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data is massive in terms of volume, variety, and production at a rapid velocity in real-time. Such big data could be used in machine learning (ML) analytic approaches to process time series clinical data to identify subtle, evolving feature patterns predictive of new-onset VTE and address this gap. This study proposes to assemble a large scale, multi-source, multi-dimensional VTE study dataset, and in tandem, systematically define the EHR data elements associated with a new-onset VTE diagnosis for computable phenotype algorithm development. We will then apply machine learning analytic approaches to baseline and accruing intensive time series clinical data in the curated dataset to develop models identifying data patterns and features predictive of dynamically evolving new-onset VTE in adult hospitalized patients. This proposal aligns with NINR’s strategic vision for nurse scientists to employ new strategies for collecting and analyzing complex big data sets to permit better understanding of the biological underpinnings of health, and improve ways nurses prevent and manage illness. This innovative study and individualized training plan under a strong and well- established team, represents initial steps in the applicant’s research trajectory focused on data science approaches to predict FTR complication risk, and develop, implement and test dynamic RAMs to inform targeted prevention and treatment decisions. Discovering new knowledge informing real-time decision making, nursing surveillance practices and care delivery systems can improve nurse sensitive patient outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of preventable hospital death. This study first proposes to develop a reproducible computable phenotype definition for new-onset VTE cohort ascertainment from the electronic health record, and then develop dynamic models for VTE risk assessment through the application of machine learning algorithms to massive electronic health record clinical data repositories. Such models can inform the mechanisms underlying this complex disease and identify subtle pattern changes in a patient’s condition forecasting a VTE event, enabling earlier nurse identification and intervention, and decreasing the development of complications and failure to rescue in hospitalized patients.",Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients,10219195,F31NR018102,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Quality of Care', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Vision', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'care delivery', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computable phenotypes', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multidimensional data', 'prevent', 'venous thromboembolism']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2020,17002,0.013661080347870379
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the US, traumatic injury is the number one cause of death for those under 45 years old and these deaths include many patients dying from the consequences of bleeding. Through leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (a scientific analysis approach similarly used in non-medical fields to help answer questions from large amounts of complex information), an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early and assist care providers in selecting the best treatment to minimize complications and death from hemorrhage.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation,9858108,R01HL149670,"['Abdomen', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bedside Technology', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Provider', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'preventable death', 'profiles in patients', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,17591,0.012841272847687426
"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"The Influence of Personality on Vocal Behavior in Singers with Phonotrauma Abstract Singers are known to be at an increased risk of developing voice disorders and often represent a large percentage of patients who are seen at voice clinics. One of the most common disorders seen in singers is vocal fold nodules that result from chronic trauma to vocal fold tissue, referred to as phonotrauma or phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction (PVH). While PVH in singers is thought do be due to the simple increase in vocal demands associated with singing, it continues to be unclear why some singers develop PVH though others do not. One factor that has been shown to be more highly associated with hyperfunctional voice disorders is personality, as described in the “Trait Theory of Voice Disorders.” Testing of this theory has provided empirical evidence that those with PVH score significantly higher on measures of extraversion, neuroticism, and impulsivity than individuals with healthy voices. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of information about whether personality relates to PVH in a similar way to singers. We hypothesize that singers with PVH will score significantly higher on personality measures related to extraversion, neuroticism, and impulsivity than singers without PVH. Additionally, information is also lacking about whether personality traits correlate with daily vocal behaviors. PVH in singers is often assumed to be the sole result of how the voice is used when singing. Our preliminary work using an ambulatory voice monitor and an automated singing classifier has shown a larger number of significant differences between singers with PVH and normal controls during speaking than during singing across a full week of monitoring. We expect that personality measures related to extraversion, neuroticism, and impulsivity will be significantly correlated with ambulatory measures that reflect the amount and type of daily voice use or vocal load, specifically in speech. We hypothesize that these relationships will be stronger in singers with PVH compared to healthy singers. The goal of the proposed project is to determine if certain personality traits are significantly related to the presence of PVH in singers and/or to the daily vocal behaviors that could contribute to the etiology and pathophysiology of phonotrauma in singers. We will administer a multidimensional personality inventory to singers diagnosed with PVH and vocally healthy matched-singers. We will compare each trait scale for singers with PVH and healthy singers using a t- test and then determine which traits are more predictive of patient status using a stepwise binary logistic regression. Each participant will also be monitored for one typical week using an ambulatory voice monitor. Relationships between personality traits scales and voice-related parameters will be conducted using Pearson's r correlations, and linear multiple regression will be used to determine which traits are the most predictive of vocal behavior. The new knowledge produced by this project could be used to aid in improving the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of vocal nodules in singers, particularly with respect to predicting which singers are at a greater risk for developing vocal fold nodules, and in targeting specific daily vocal behaviors during treatment. Laura Toles PROJECT NARRATIVE Singers are known carry an elevated risk of developing voice disorders, specifically those that are presumed to result from chronic vocal fold tissue trauma such as vocal fold nodules. However, despite the increased voice use requirements of singing, not all singers develop vocal fold nodules. This study aims to identify the influence that personality traits have on ambulatory voice behaviors to differentiate singers with vocal fold nodules from singers with healthy voices. Specifically, we hypothesize that personality measures related to extraversion, neuroticism, and impulsivity will be more strongly correlated with the amount and type of daily voice use or vocal load in speech in singers with vocal fold nodules. We expect that knowledge gained from this project will be useful to improve prevention of vocal fold nodules through prediction of individual risk for singers, and in targeting specific daily vocal behaviors during treatment.",The Influence of Personality on Vocal Behavior in Singers with Phonotrauma,10141147,F31DC019284,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Behavior', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Etiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Nodule', 'Occupations', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Personality inventories', 'Prevention', 'Risk', 'Speech', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Vocal Cord Nodule', 'Voice', 'Voice Disorders', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'improved', 'social', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tissue trauma', 'trait', 'vocal cord']",NIDCD,MGH INSTITUTE OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS,F31,2020,33120,-0.03483130509362445
"Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) are at increased risk for numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, suicidality, substance use, HIV/AIDS, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Despite clear documentation and replication of these health disparities, relatively little is known about their development from adolescence into adulthood. Two theories primarily dominate the literature. Minority stress models describe unique life stressors experienced only by sexual minorities (e.g., victimization and discrimination based on sexual orientation) as primary contributors to health disparities. Other models implicate both minority stress and normative psychosocial processes together as contributors to health disparities. Some such normative processes include (1) psychological adjustment and characteristics (e.g., emotion regulation/dysregulation, substance use expectancies), (2) disrupted social systems (e.g., family, peers, school), and (3) individual differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, temperament). To date, most studies of both minority stress and normative processes are limited by use of cross-sectional samples of primarily Caucasian adults. Although much has been learned from these studies, they do not permit analysis of emerging health disparities across development. Existing research is therefore limited in terms of both generalizability to diverse populations, and validity of directionality inferences between observed ‘predictors’ and ‘outcomes’. My long-term career goals are to identify mechanisms leading to disparities among sexual minorities, with the goal of improving treatments for these disparities, and to develop screening tools to identify high-risk youth who would benefit from prevention programs. To reach this goal, in this project, I address existing limitations to the literature using a prospective sample of individuals who were 14-19 years old at baseline and followed for over 4 years. My goal is to describe developmental trajectories and mechanisms of health disparity development for sexual minority youth compared with heterosexual youth across a 10-year developmental window spanning ages 14- 23 years. Longitudinal outcomes include depression/anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, sleep, general physical health, disordered eating and substance use. Developmental trajectories for these outcomes will be charted by gender and sexual orientation. Confirmatory analyses based on existing literature will be conducted to examine relations between minority stress and adverse outcomes. Then, I will use machine learning to identify as-yet unknown predictors of adverse outcomes and health disparities and characterize any changes in prediction across time. Finally, I will use state-of-the art intervening variable analyses (mediation, moderation) to evaluate longitudinal mechanisms through which health disparities emerge. Findings should provide insight into mechanisms of disparity development and maintenance, informing prevention and intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) experience wide-ranging disparities in mental and physical health that often persist into adulthood, yet little is known about development of these disparities. This research (1) examines developmental trajectories in mental and physical health outcomes from adolescence to young adulthood among sexual minority and matched heterosexual youth, (2) uses advanced statistical methods (e.g., machine learning) to identify hypothesized and currently unknown factors that predict disparities over time, and (3) elucidates pathways to adversity and resilience. Experiences of sexual minority and heterosexual youth and young adults will be compared to uncover possible differences in developmental experiences that lead to health disparities, with possible implications for prevention and intervention among a highly vulnerable population.",Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing,9929425,F31MD014052,"['19 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Asthma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child Rearing', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Documentation', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expectancy', 'Family', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterosexuals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sex Orientation', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spirituality', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Victimization', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'emerging adult', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'non-heterosexual', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer victimization', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'resilience', 'sexual identity', 'sexual minority', 'sexual risk behavior', 'social', 'social factors', 'stressor', 'substance misuse', 'theories', 'treatment disparity', 'young adult']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,33937,-0.017612189528509414
"Using Big Data to Understand Sepsis in an Immunocompromised Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Through this proposal, I will develop and evaluate a sepsis prediction tool targeted to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Allogeneic HCT recipients are an immunocompromised population that is disproportionately affected by sepsis, a life-threatening dysregulated immunologic response to an infection. While it is well established that early detection and treatment of sepsis with fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics reduce the risk of mortality, recent data suggests early broad-spectrum antibiotic use in allogeneic HCT recipients may have microbiota-mediated detrimental effects on morbidity and mortality. Because of the risks associated with both missed and falsely identified sepsis events among allogeneic HCT recipients, early and accurate sepsis diagnosis is crucial. However, sepsis is generally challenging to diagnose and is made more complicated in allogeneic HCT recipients by the fact that sepsis presents differently following transplantation and common complications of the transplant procedure present like sepsis. In previous work, we demonstrated that current sepsis clinical criteria have low predictive value among allogeneic HCT recipients and concluded that population specific prediction tools are needed. Recently developed single algorithm, machine learning sepsis prediction tools have shown promising results in general, immuno-competent populations. However, few studies have tested the ability of machine learning workflows to predict sepsis in high-risk, immunocompromised patients, such as allogeneic HCT recipients. Additionally, current sepsis prediction tools rely on the assumption that the true relationship between the predictors and the outcome is contained within a single algorithm. This proposed work has two main objectives. The first is to develop an automated sepsis prediction tool for allogeneic HCT recipients using a state-of-the-art ensemble-based machine learning workflow (the super learner) that relaxes the single algorithm assumption of current sepsis prediction tools. The second is to estimate the utility of this tool in comparison to currently available tools in both traditional (accuracy methods) and novel ways (mathematical modeling of health outcomes). Both aims will be completed with the ultimate goal of improving sepsis prediction among allogeneic HCT recipients and in such, reducing sepsis related mortality and inappropriate antibiotic use among this hard to diagnose population. Further, this research will advance the methodological discussion around the usefulness of machine learning prediction tools in clinical practice and the use of ensemble modeling for prediction of rare, high-case fatality diseases. Such advances have the potential to improve the prediction of health outcomes beyond sepsis and reduce the burden of treatable diseases among immunocompromised populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening dysregulated host response to an infection that disproportionately affects allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Early detection and appropriate antibiotic therapy have been shown to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with sepsis, but clinical criteria currently recommended in sepsis detection have poor predictive value among HCT recipients.

"Symptom Cluster Profiles Following Traumatic Orthopaedic Injuries PROJECT SUMMARY  Each year, traumatic injuries affect millions of Americans, resulting in $671 billion in healthcare costs and lost productivity. They are also the leading cause of death before age 47 and of years of potential life lost before age 75. In addition to societal costs, symptoms, such as pain, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and stress related disorders are highly prevalent following traumatic orthopaedic injuries (TOI) and may contribute to negative long-term health outcomes.  Identifying symptom cluster profiles following TOI may lead to recognizing those at highest risk for negative outcomes. Although the mechanisms for symptom cluster profiles are not completely known, they may share a common etiology. Using a theoretical framework created by incorporating the National Institutes of Health Symptom Science Model and the Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms, the proposed study will utilize a cross- sectional design to describe membership in symptom cluster profiles, examine the associations between demographic and clinical factors and membership in symptom cluster profiles, and measure the extent to which serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the val66met single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6265) of the BDNF gene are associated with membership in symptom cluster profiles among a diverse sample of TOI survivors recruited within the first 24 hours of their injury in a large, urban level one trauma center. Latent profile analysis with multinomial logistic regression will be used to describe group membership in the symptom cluster profiles and their associations with demographic and clinical factors and biomarker data.  The aims of this study are to 1) describe TOI survivors' membership in symptom cluster profiles, indicated by pain, sleep disturbance, and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress related disorders, immediately following a TOI; and 2) examine associations between demographic and clinical factors and symptom cluster profile membership among TOI survivors. 3) test the hypothesis that low serum concentrations of BDNF are associated with membership among symptom cluster profiles following TOI; and 4) test the hypothesis that the presence of the val66met SNP on one or both alleles of the BDNF gene is associated membership among symptom cluster profiles following TOI.  The results of this study will provide essential preliminary data to support future studies examining self- and symptom management following TOI. The training plan includes specific experiences designed to promote extensive knowledge of the biobehavioral responses of individuals following TOI, and the screening and management of post-injury symptoms. Aligned with the NINR's strategic plan to promote precision health through research of the role of biomarkers in symptom science, the proposed work will provide an essential foundation for a career in nursing research focused on investigating biobehavioral mechanisms of, and interventions for, symptom cluster profiles in TOI survivors. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Experiencing a traumatic orthopaedic injury exposes individuals to the risk of developing post-injury symptoms that may present in a comorbid manner, or cluster, to affect long term health outcomes and health- related quality of life. Identifying subgroups of TOI survivors based upon their symptom experiences, or symptom cluster profiles, can reveal those at highest risk for developing negative outcomes, who may be in the greatest need of intervention. The purpose of this study is to describe membership in symptom cluster profiles among survivors of traumatic orthopaedic injuries and to examine the way in which demographic and clinical factors and biomarkers explain survivors' membership in symptom cluster profiles.",Symptom Cluster Profiles Following Traumatic Orthopaedic Injuries,9990180,F31NR018996,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Fracture Healing', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Status', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methionine', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nursing Research', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Spinal Cord', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Valine', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'career', 'clinical care', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'enhancing factor', 'experience', 'healing', 'health related quality of life', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual response', 'neuron development', 'neurotrophic factor', 'pain symptom', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'postsynaptic neurons', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'screening', 'societal costs', 'stress related disorder', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'trauma centers']",NINR,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,-0.026789384224717612
"Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke Project Summary Stroke is a highly heterogeneous and complex disease and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification of the cause of disease is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but can be difficult, as up to 35% of causes are undetermined by traditional subtyping criteria and very few causative genetic variants have been found. In addition, certain causes may be hidden within the clinical picture of a patient, such as an adverse drug reaction. Using data-driven approaches to analyze the medical records of patients may uncover novel patterns of risk factors and clinical features leading to stroke. The long-term goal of this research is to identify novel subtypes of highly heterogeneous diseases such as stroke and to reduce the genetic heterogeneity of a disease cohort by identifying patients with the same subtype. The objective of this application is to propose a pipeline that applies a data-driven analysis of medical notes to identify novel subtypes of stroke, focus on a subtype caused by an adverse drug reaction or drug pair interaction, validate the subtype in a genotyped study cohort, and look for gene variant enrichment in this cohort. This application’s central hypothesis is that applying deep learning to the electronic health record (EHR) of acute ischemic stroke patients will form subtypes based on more granular information than currently implemented and with reduced genetic heterogeneity by identifying novel patterns of risk factors and clinical picture leading to the stroke. In addition, we hypothesize that at least one subtype will identify patients whose stroke is an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction. To do this, Aim 1 will first identify all acute ischemic stroke patients in the EHR by developing a machine learning classifier trained on structured data in the EHR. Aim 2 will then build and train an unsupervised deep learning algorithm on text from medical notes to identify clusters, or subtypes, of patients with similar clinical pictures. Aim 3 will finally validate reduction in genetic heterogeneity of these cohorts by estimating observational heritability of all subtypes using a tool created in our lab and comparing this with the heritability estimates of subtypes derived from physician-based criteria. It will also focus on a not well-studied subtype, stroke due to an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction, by identifying its enrichment in the novel subtypes, validating this subtype in a study cohort with genotyped data, and finally looking for enrichment of pharmacogenetic variants in this subtype. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that identifies novel subtypes of acute ischemic stroke, enabling improved future genetic studies by reducing genetic heterogeneity of cohorts and improved understanding of the underlying causes of the disease. Project Narrative Stroke is a highly complex disease that is a leading cause of death and severe disability. Identifying the cause of stroke is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but up to a third of cases are of undetermined cause, and very few genetic variants have been identified due to the heterogeneity of the disease. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational pipeline that applies data-driven deep learning to medical notes to identify novel combinations of environmental, genetic, and medical risk factors causing the disease; this tool may clarify the etiology of unknown stroke cases, provide cohorts of patients enriched with similar genetic variants, and be expanded to subtype any disease.",Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke,9999028,F30HL140946,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Internet', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stroke', 'adverse drug reaction', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'falls', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'learning classifier', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient health information', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'population based', 'random forest', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'structured data', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F30,2020,50016,-0.025593196864220496
"Are phenotype algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults?- Revision Are phenotyping algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults? According to the latest population estimates by the US Census bureau, the United States population is growing older and more diverse, with their projections indicating that in 2035 there will be more people 65-and-older than 18-and-younger. In terms of diversity, the US Census Bureau projects that by 2060 the non-Hispanic White-alone population will shrink by 20 million, leading to the increased representation of currently underrepresented minority groups. These future population milestones paired with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) use in medicine, present a very unique and problematic problem: determining if AI solutions are fair for underrepresented populations within older adults. This has been a very debated issue, with opinion pieces in the New York times making it clear that when done incorrectly, AI solutions can actually worsen health disparities in underrepresented populations due to the nature of the training sets for said AI solutions. It is intuitive to understand how dermatology AI systems could be biased to perform better for lighter skinned individuals, due to the prevalence of said patients in the training datasets. Other biases come from the fact that there is simply a lack of diverse research subjects, which is why their mortality outcomes are considerably worse. Electronic phenotyping algorithms are the cornerstone for automatic identification of selected patient groups for tasks like disease classification, epidemiological studies and clinical-trial recruitment. These algorithms are both rule-based or probabilistic in nature (machine learning models), and are usually built by using bundled patient populations (everybody put together), with very few exceptions (due to the nature of the phenotype) having some sort of stratification of populations. This proposed project seeks to identify bias in probabilistic electronic phenotype algorithms for older populations and create best-practices and software tools to overcome them in order to lead to better health outcomes. Are phenotyping algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults? We will determine racial and age bias in probabilistic phenotype algorithms in both local, and national datasets. After characterizing bias, we will develop best-practices and software tools to improve the phenotyping process to achieve fairness for underrepresented minorities.",Are phenotype algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults?- Revision,10049865,P30AG059307,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Censuses', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data Set', 'Dermatology', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Excision', 'Expert Systems', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research Subjects', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States', 'base', 'disease classification', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic bias', 'ethnic diversity', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'population stratification', 'racial bias', 'recruit']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,P30,2020,50916,0.007446943920464382
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,10226398,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social determinants', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2020,54000,-0.012492691822501071
"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,10163298,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2020,75521,-0.01771814872902465
"Healthcare Impact of Consumer-Driven Atrial Fibrillation Detection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Companies are increasingly marketing mobile technologies as FDA-cleared medical devices, yet we do not know the consequences of these devices on healthcare utilization, cost, and outcomes. Recently, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 4 as an FDA-cleared medical device. The device includes an alert for the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and allows anyone to monitor their heart rhythm for the presence of AF. Apple has an enormous global audience, and the number of people who will use this (and other similar devices) to self-diagnose or monitor AF will be substantial. On one hand, the device may allow new diagnoses that result in treatment, improved quality of life, fewer AF related complications. On the other hand, the device may result in false positives in otherwise healthy people, resulting in more testing and treatments with associated harms. In fact, the U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends against routine surveillance for AF in the general population, citing lack of evidence and possible harm. We have an urgent need for a population-based infrastructure to ensure that technologies entering the market as medical devices are beneficial and safe.  The overall goal of this project is to measure the uptake and effect of the Apple Watch 4 release on healthcare utilization among first-time and known AF patients. Dr. Shah is an early stage investigator with a K08 Career Development Award from the NHLBI. As part of the K08, she has developed a detailed cohort of contemporary AF patients, including clinical notes. Along with a team, she will use real world data, as proposed by the FDA, to generate evidence about risks and benefits of consumer-driven AF detection. She will use natural language processing to leverage the notes and identify AF patients who seek care due to the medical device, and evaluate downstream healthcare utilization, such as additional clinic visits, cardioversions, additional remote monitoring, and cost. The goals of this project will be accomplished through the following Specific Aims: 1) Estimate the proportion of first-time AF patient visits attributable to a mobile device before and after FDA clearance of the Apple Watch 4, and characterize device accuracy and downstream healthcare utilization in this population; and 2) Evaluate healthcare utilization patterns among prevalent AF patients who use mobile devices with AF alerts.  In 2017, Apple sold 17.7 million smart watches, in a device market that continues to grow. Extrapolating from prior annual sales and conservatively assuming a 5% increase in users each year, almost 60 million people will have an Apple Watch by the end of 2020 (not accounting for non-Apple devices with similar functionality). Thus, even in this short period of time, uptake will be substantial and warrant immediate feedback. The results of this project will provide preliminary data for a long-term, multicenter study that evaluates the benefits (improved quality of life, fewer strokes) and harms (increased treatment complications, increased cost) of consumer-driven AF detection. PROJECT NARRATIVE The consequence of mobile technologies marketed as medical devices are unknown, including devices that provide alerts for the presence of atrial fibrillation. The goal of this project is to evaluate the benefits and harm associated with consumer-driven atrial fibrillation detection.",Healthcare Impact of Consumer-Driven Atrial Fibrillation Detection,9980996,R03HL148372,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Apple', 'Apple watch', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electric Countershock', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Infrastructure', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sales', 'Series', 'Sinus', 'Stroke', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Visit', 'base', 'care seeking', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'cryptogenic stroke', 'design', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care service utilization', 'heart rhythm', 'improved', 'mobile computing', 'population based', 'routine screening', 'self diagnosis', 'smart watch', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R03,2020,76250,0.006814873776138102
"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",10022505,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2020,79000,0.009199208178556377
"Sense4Safety: Supporting socially vulnerable older adults Abstract Falls and fall-related injuries are significant public health issues for adults 65 years of age and older. Over a third of older adults (OA) fall each year and 10-20% of falls result in serious injuries such as fractures and head trauma. The annual direct medical costs in the US as a result of falls are estimated to exceed $50 billion, and this estimate does not include the indirect costs of disability, dependence, and decreased quality of life. This project targets community dwelling OA with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are socially vulnerable. MCI is a leading risk factor for falls in OA. Approximately 15%-20% of OA have MCI, and over 60% of OA with MCI fall annually – two to three times the rate of those without cognitive impairment. Socially vulnerable OA living in low-resource neighborhoods with poor housing conditions have twice the risk of falling. We have developed an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk. The purpose of this study is to refine the Sense4Safety intervention based on extensive feedback by low income OA with MCI, their family members or trusted others and clinicians in order to ensure that the passive monitoring system to predict fall risk for OA with MCI can generate actionable and tailored information that can be used effectively by these stakeholder groups. Project Narrative The proposed research study aims to refine an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk.

"BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study Patients increasingly survive critical care, but for many the experience is psychologically tormenting in part because they lose all control over their environment. Patients with neurological injury in particular suffer from this major loss of autonomy which impacts their long term recovery. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology transforms physiological changes associated with patient thoughts into actionable outputs. The technology is rapidly advancing and well established outside of the critical care setting. The goal of this project is to determine whether conscious and unconscious appearing ICU patients are able to communicate their basic needs, such as pain, hunger, and thirst, to health care providers using the BCI technology. We will apply a bedside BCI system in the ICU using a machine-learning algorithm that analyzes changes in routine EEG in response to standardized questions presented to the patient by headphones. The BCI system will provide immediate closed- loop feedback (auditory and/or visual) to patients about their performance. To achieve our goals, we will first test if conscious ICU patients are able to express basic needs, such as pain, to health care providers using the BCI technology. Patients will trigger the BCI system to then express their needs in response to specific questions (e.g., “Do you have pain?”). Secondly, we will determine whether basic communication is possible for patients with cognitive motor dissociation (i.e., patients who appear unconscious, but follow commands using EEG motor imagery paradigms). We will test if these patients are able to use the BCI system to respond to simple questions (i.e., “Activate the alarm”). Finally, we will assess the patient's experience using BCI technology as part of this study, as well as acceptance of using BCI technology in future clinical trials from patients, families, and health care providers involved in the study. The long-term goal of this proposal is to prepare a large clinical trial to test the benefits of BCI-assisted communication in brain-injured ICU patients. Patients in critical care suffer an almost complete loss of control over their most basic needs (e.g., they are unable to tell someone that they are hungry), which is stressful and impacts their long term recovery. This is a major problem for the many patients with acute brain injury. We propose to make technology available that would allow even some unresponsive‐appearing patients to communicate these needs with care givers and family members.",BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study,9931317,R03NS112760,"['Acute Brain Injuries', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Conscious', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Fever', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hunger', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patient Education', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Recovery', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Thirst', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized strategies', 'practical application', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sound', 'willingness']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2020,81000,-0.054574710561498575
"Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records Project Summary/Abstract This project proposes new methods for representing data in electronic health records (EHR) to improve pre- dictive modeling and interpretation of patient outcomes. EHR data offer a promising opportunity for advancing the understanding of how clinical decisions and patient conditions interact over time to inﬂuence patient health. However, EHR data are difﬁcult to use for predictive modeling due to the various data types they contain (con- tinuous, categorical, text, etc.), their longitudinal nature, the high amount of non-random missingness for certain measurements, and other concerns. Furthermore, patient outcomes often have heterogenous causes and re- quire information to be synthesized from several clinical lab measures and patient visits. The core challenge at hand is overcoming the mismatch between data representations in the EHR and the assumptions underly- ing commonly used statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. To this end, this project proposes novel wrapper-based methods for learning informative features from EHR data. Both methods propose specialized operators to handle sequential data, time delays, and variable interactions, and have the capacity to discover underlying clinical rules/decisions that affect patient outcomes. Importantly, both methods also produce archives of possible models that represent the best trade-offs between complexity and accuracy, which assists in model interpretation. These method advances are made possible by encoding a rich set of data operations as nodes in a directed acyclic graph, and optimizing the graph structures using multi-objective optimization. The central hypothesis of this research is that multi-objective optimization can learn effective data representations from the EHR to produce accurate, explanatory models of patient outcomes. Preliminary work has shown that these methods can effectively learn low-order data representations that improve the predictive ability of several state- of-the-art ML methods. This technique demonstrates good scaling properties with high-dimensional biomedical data. Aim 1 (K99) is to develop a multi-objective feature engineering method that pairs with existing ML methods to iteratively improve their performance by constructing new features from the raw data and using feedback from the trained model to guide feature construction. In Aim 2 (K99), this method is applied to form predictive models of the risk of heart disease and heart failure using longitudinal EHR data. The resultant models will be inter- preted with the help of mentors in order to translate predictions into clinical recommendations. For Aim 3 (R00), a second method is proposed that uses a similar framework to optimize existing neural network approaches in order to simplify their structure as much as possible while maintaining accuracy. The goal of Aim 4 (R00) is to identify hospital patients who are at risk of readmission and propose point-of-care strategies to mitigate that risk. This goal is facilitated through the application of the proposed methods to patient data collected from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, the Geisinger Health System, and publicly available EHR databases. Project Narrative  Understanding how clinical decisions interact with a patient's health and environmental over time to inﬂuence patient outcomes is central to the goals of enhancing health, reducing illness and improving quality of life. The proposed research provides important methodological advances for extracting these insights from widely available patient health records.",Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records,9936444,K99LM012926,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'University Hospitals', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'care costs', 'cluster computing', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder subtype', 'heart disease risk', 'high dimensionality', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'patient health information', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'readmission rates', 'readmission risk', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2020,89401,0.00378413645718081
"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,9830682,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2020,100000,-0.0075189414607602445
"A New Tool to Rapidly Diagnose Sepsis using Flow Imaging Microscopy and Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is a serious condition induced by an infection, often by a bacterial pathogen, leading to organ damage or even death. Despite numerous advances in medicine over the years, the condition still affects millions of people in both developed and developing countries. In the US, sepsis affects 1.7M and kills over 265,000 people annually. Sepsis mortality rates in developing countries are substantially higher. In terms of demographics, sepsis affects humans of all age and race, but it is most pronounced at the age extremes (infants and the elderly) and patients whose immune system is already under strain due to other illnesses or immune system-weakening therapies, e.g., cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.  Blood cultures are currently the default technique used in detecting and diagnosing the root cause of sepsis. However, blood-cultures can take upwards of 24-48 hours in order to obtain results. In that time, the patient can experience irreversible harm due to the condition if not treated properly. Unfortunately, precise and effective antibiotic treatment requires knowledge of the pathogen causing sepsis. Beyond a long time to get an answer, blood cultures often exhibit alarmingly high false negatives (failure to detect a pathogen causing sepsis) and typically do not precisely identify the pathogen causing sepsis.  Hence there have been several efforts aimed at detecting and identifying the broad range of potential pathogens causing sepsis and circumventing the need for blood cultures. However, many of the recently proposed methods for detecting and diagnosing sepsis exhibit one or more of the following drawbacks: (i) they lack high sensitivity (ability to detect a pathogen); (ii) they cannot accurately identify a broad range of pathogens from a single sam- ple; (iii) take a (relatively) long time; (iv) require a large volume of blood; or (v) cannot be used in the real-time monitoring of sepsis (either detecting pathogens known to cause sepsis or quantifying the patient's response to antimicrobial treatment).  We are proposing a new sepsis detection method, combining ﬂow imaging microscopy (a high-throughput technique for imaging millions of microscopic particles) and deep learning based image analysis (techniques leveraged in facial recognition and self-driving cars) to overcome the above mentioned limitations. The approach has proven capable of detecting a variety of bacterial species in low concentrations of mouse blood in less than 1 hour of processing time with as little as 50 L of blood. In this proposal, one of our aims is to optimize our approach and quantify the accuracy and limits of detection in human blood. Our patent pending approach has also been licensed to a major manufacturer of ﬂow imaging microscopes. Another aim of this research is to begin integration of our technology with an existing commercial instrument with the intention of providing a compact self- contained device that can be deployed at numerous hospitals world-wide. The implementation of our platform should have a major impact on antimicrobial treatment in all areas of the hospital. Project Narrative  Sepsis affects 1.7M US citizens (causing roughly 270k deaths) each year; the condition is also the most expensive condition treated in US hospitals costing approximately 24B USD each year. Current methods for detecting and determining the source of the infection causing sepsis are inaccurate, too slow, and do not provide detailed pathogen speciﬁc information needed for effective treatment. Our proposal aims at developing a fast approach, combining ﬂow imaging microscopy and deep learning, for detecting and determining the root cause of sepsis from blood samples (addressing many issues facing sepsis detection and diagnosis) which can deployed at a variety of hospitals worldwide.",A New Tool to Rapidly Diagnose Sepsis using Flow Imaging Microscopy and Machine Learning,10078833,R43EB029863,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bedside Testings', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification Scheme', 'Colony-forming units', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Systems', 'Culture Techniques', 'DNA', 'Detection', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infection', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Length of Stay', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature Birth', 'Preparation', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'age group', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'detector', 'digital imaging', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'human DNA', 'human old age (65+)', 'image processing', 'improved', 'infant death', 'instrument', 'intrapartum', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'nano', 'nanoproducts', 'neonatal sepsis', 'older patient', 'optic flow', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient response', 'point of care', 'preterm newborn', 'processing speed', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'real time monitoring', 'side effect', 'tool']",NIBIB,"URSA ANALYTICS, INC.",R43,2020,112401,0.006338321957738339
"Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI) Project Summary/Abstract  Substance misuse is inconsistently addressed in routine medical practice. Primary care physicians frequently fail to diagnose substance abuse when presented with early symptoms of alcohol or drug use. Patients report that less than one-third of primary care physicians carefully screen them for substance abuse, in spite of available and effective screening protocols. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an integrated, evidence-based approach aimed at delivering early intervention for drug and alcohol misuse in medical settings and has been demonstrated to reduce substance misuse. Motivational Interviewing (MI), an underlying component of SBIRT, is an evidence-based, brief interventional approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors. Unfortunately, the MI approach is very difficult to teach to practitioners as it is counterintuitive to most providers who commonly take a directive approach with patients. Because of ineffective training, MI and SBIRT are under-utilized.  The primary goal of this project is to transform MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that analyzes practitioner responses and gives immediate feedback to improve MI skills. Our team has been developing and testing a training tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI). ReadMI is a low cost, ultra-portable solution for accurate and automatic real-time assessment of dialog during the course of MI training. It makes use of the latest advances in deep-learning-based speech recognition and mobile and cloud computing technologies to enable instantaneous MI training assessment and analysis. Currently functioning with 92% accuracy, ReadMI provides immediate feedback to MI and SBIRT trainees regarding the number of open- and closed-ended questions asked, provider-vs-patient conversation time, and other integral components of MI.  ReadMI will advance the skill development of physicians and other healthcare professionals in their use of MI and SBIRT, minimizing the need for time-consuming reviews of recorded training sessions. Our aims are: 1) develop ReadMI to provide MI training metrics with 95% accuracy and 2) test ReadMI in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 200 medical students and residents, 100 who will receive SBIRT/MI training with ReadMI and 100 who will serve as the control group, receiving customary SBIRT/MI training.  The prospective applications of ReadMI extend far beyond substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, detection, and intervention. The effectiveness of all chronic disease management is largely dependent on patient behavior. MI is a patient-focused conversation between the provider and the patient that reinforces the patient's motivation to make positive changes in health-related behavior. By making efficient MI training available to more health professionals, ReadMI will improve healthcare quality as providers are better equipped in their efforts to help patients make healthy lifestyle changes. Project Narrative Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors, including substance misuse. However, MI and a specific application of MI to substance misuse known as SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) are underutilized because of inadequate training of health professionals. This research aims to revolutionize MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that uses natural language processing to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI).",Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI),9980343,R21HS026548,[' '],AHRQ,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,118134,0.0003760157547048314
"Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa Project Summary Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a neglected, prevalent, chronic, stigmatizing, and debilitating disease that has recently been prioritized for study by NIAMS. Evidence suggests that some HS patients choose to self-manage symptoms remaining unconnected to healthcare, and some seek medical care for repeated outbreaks of boils but never receive a diagnosis. Such ‘hidden populations’ create challenges for designing research studies that are generalizable. Precision medicine initiatives and resources offer opportunities to rapidly increase our knowledge about biological causes of HS and to improve the care that HS patients receive. For example, the NIH has made considerable investments in the development of data repositories that link genetic data to EHR for hundreds of thousands of patients, including the NHGRI-funded eMERGE Network and the NIH-funded All of Us Research Program. Columbia University investigators are integral members of these nationwide programs, both as a recruitment site, as well as a data and research center (5U01HG008680, 1OT2OD026556). Engaging research participants who are willing to contribute longitudinal data is a major obstacle to precision medicine initiatives. The public’s use of the Internet and social media to obtain and exchange health-related information has created opportunities to rapidly and efficiently assemble large longitudinal cohorts, yet there are important differences from traditional research methods and best practice guidelines have yet to be developed. Columbia University is at the forefront of the development and application of these methods. A major challenge to implementing precision medicine arises from patients who share a diagnosis but have different biological causes of disease. HS patients have a high burden of comorbidities and we hypothesize that sets of comorbidities that tend to present together in individual patients can be used to identify biologically relevant disease subtypes. Here we will use three approaches to identify patterns of comorbidities within patients, to characterize the generalizability of the results from studies conducted in EHR, and to use genetic data to biologically validate comorbidities and resolve causality underlying disease associations. Training in biomedical informatics and Internet-based survey research will allow the applicant to use EHR data and Internet resources for assembling cohorts to conduct these studies, and complement her previous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, molecular biology and human genetics, providing fluency across several domains that are crucial for advancing precision medicine initiatives. Completion of this proposal will achieve the applicant’s long-term goal of obtaining advanced training aimed at implementing precision medicine in the treatment of skin disease. Project Narrative This project addresses the imperative needs of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) patients who suffer from pain, stigma, diminished quality of life, decreased work productivity, and increased healthcare costs that arise from managing a difficult-to-treat, debilitating disease with a high burden of comorbidities. We will conduct studies of HS comorbidities to identify biologically distinct subclasses of HS in large samples of patients using data in electronic health records and data collected from Internet surveys. This work will improve the precision of HS diagnoses and set up the infrastructure for future large-scale studies of HS.",Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa,9977561,K01AR075111,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Anogenital region', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axilla', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Furuncles', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Inguinal region', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Stigmatization', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'medically underserved', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'online resource', 'patient engagement', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'research study', 'skin disorder', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'symptom self management', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2020,121288,-0.018036696807262553
"A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Carotid artery atherosclerosis is a major vascular risk factor and accounts for approximately 15% of all strokes. A major risk marker in patients with carotid atherosclerosis has been the degree of narrowing, or stenosis, of the carotid artery lumen. While stenosis is often quantified via angiography, imaging can also provide detailed assessments of plaque. Our project is motivated by converging data that correlate vulnerable plaque elements, which can be captured with imaging, with increased stroke risk. Identifying high-risk or vulnerable carotid plaques before a stroke occurs is important because stroke prevention treatments, like carotid endarterectomy or stenting, carry risks and ideally should only be performed only those patients at highest risk of stroke. CTA (computed tomographic angiography) is an attractive tool for plaque imaging since it is not operator dependent, can be quickly performed, and is more widely available than MRI. Although CTA offers significant potential to evaluate these plaque features, small studies have not reached a consensus regarding their reliability and clinical relevance. In this project, we plan to explore the utility of CTA for the detailed carotid vessel wall imaging by employing a unique, large-scale clinical dataset and advanced algorithms. Our overarching objective in this R21 project is to conduct developmental and interdisciplinary research that will lay the foundation for the implementation and validation of novel CTA-based technologies that can be adopted in the risk stratification of patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Our central hypothesis is that there are CTA-based carotid plaque features that can be reliably extracted and used for stroke risk stratification, which will be more sensitive and specific than standard stenosis grading. To pursue our objective, we will pursue two specific aims: In Specific Aim 1 we plan to optimize the use of human reader defined plaque features in predicting culprit carotid plaques. We will perform a blinded, multi-reader study of CTA-derived carotid plaque features in a large scale clinical dataset to test the association between CTA-derived human-defined features and stroke, and compute accuracy metrics. In Specific Aim 2, we plan to develop algorithms to automatically characterize and discriminate culprit carotid plaque in CTA. We will implement and test image processing algorithms that automatically compute from a CTA scan stroke-associated carotid artery plaque features (from Aim 1), and then train a machine learning algorithm to distinguish culprit from asymptomatic carotid artery plaques. We believe that this R21 study is significant because it will establish a novel, machine learning-aided imaging strategy which can aid in identifying high-risk carotid artery plaques before they cause stroke and when they can be properly treated to prevent stroke from occurring in the future. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of novel and treatable vascular risk factors will ultimately improve risk factor screening and stroke prevention efforts, thereby reducing the incidence of a disabling and lethal disease. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NHLBI's mission that involves reducing the burden of vascular disease by fostering research on prevention.",A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis,9904175,R21HL145427,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Carotid Endarterectomy', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Carotid stent', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Statistical Models', 'Stenosis', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'calcification', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2020,121967,0.0073074124227063865
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9963329,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2020,128408,-0.0008071317812433588
"Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have well-established risk factors such as physical activity (PA), depression, and hypertension (HTN). These risk factors disproportionately affect racial minority populations, but the mechanisms underlying racial health disparities are not well understood. In this, geographic factors could be key, as PA, depression and HTN are strongly affected by geographic exposures, including green space. However, green space is typically measured with questionnaires, which have substantial error, or satellite-based indexes that are nonspecific and provide no information on the type of vegetation (e.g., tree vs. grass), nor whether the vegetation is within view at the street level. As a result, no study has quantified the contribution of green space to racial disparities in ADRD. And while novel technologies such as Google Street Views (GSV) imaging are promising data sources for capturing unique measures of green space, managing, processing, and analyzing high-dimensional data present significant logistical and analytical challenges, especially when linking these data to existing data from large prospective cohorts. Finally, we need to understand green space in the context of other potentially correlated geographic exposures, or the urban exposome—the totality of life- course geographic exposures (the set of green space, air pollutants, noise, built environment, and social environment)—to estimate which factors drive health. This proposal will address these challenges by using GSV imaging to assess the effect of green space on PA, depression, and HTN, as well as subsequent ADRD risk within the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)—a 10-year longitudinal study of 6,814 men and women without clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline from 4 racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic White, African-American, Chinese, and Hispanic). Aim 1 will quantify the effect of specific aspects of green space (e.g. trees, grass, shrubs, plants) on ADRD and cognitive decline and evaluate whether these associations differ according to race/ethnicity. Aim 2 will determine the indirect effect of green space on ADRD that is mediated through PA, depression, and HTN. Aim 3 will quantify exposome associations with ADRD and cognitive decline using untargeted data-driven approaches in conjunction with dimension reduction techniques and evaluate whether they differ according to race/ethnicity. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) implementing deep learning algorithms to analyze high-resolution geographic data, (2) cognitive function epidemiology, and (3) developing and refining data-driven approaches to perform exposome-informed epidemiological studies. These combined plans will successfully prepare the applicant for an independent research career focused on identifying modifiable geographic determinants of ADRD in diverse populations using innovative measures of geographic context. Project Narrative Green space or trees and natural vegetation can provide mental health benefits and possibly lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); however, green space is often measured poorly in epidemiologic research. I propose to integrate high-resolution images from Google Street Views to derive ground-level objective measurements of green space into a diverse prospective cohort study using deep learning algorithms, mediation analysis and geographic mixtures. This research will enable unprecedented perspectives on exposures that drive ADRD and related cognitive decline risk, and will provide translational insights into potential interventions to optimize opportunities for ADRD prevention and reduce racial disparities in ADRD.",Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment,9952648,K99AG066949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air Pollutants', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Baltimore', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chicago', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Green space', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Los Angeles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Plants', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Social Environment', 'Social Impacts', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'built environment', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'economic impact', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'healthy aging', 'high resolution imaging', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'men', 'multidimensional data', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial disparity', 'racial health disparity', 'racial minority', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'urban public health']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2020,129600,-0.031075023184881808
"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,9891542,K01DK120784,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Network', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adjudication', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'computable phenotypes', 'data warehouse', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prognostic tool', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2020,130488,-0.022347220434912066
"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9949693,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'econometrics', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data sources', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness', 'supervised learning']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2020,131517,0.010885300190838927
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9912764,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2020,139614,-0.0038247070407263412
"Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure Candidate objective: My objective for this award is to become an independent quantitative scientist in analytical clinical research through structured training and mentored research experience. My goal is to become an academic leader and developer of advanced predictive models of health trajectories using electronic health records (EHR). Training objectives: I seek to sharpen my skill set as a clinical quantitative scientist using clinical informatics, EHR data warehouses, and advanced computational models. I will use the protected time provided by this award to gain proficiency in patient-clinician interactions, clinical informatics, natural language processing, and advanced survival analysis to accomplish my research aims. Background: Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with aging and chronic illness. It decreases physiological reserves and increases vulnerability to stressors. The prevalence of frailty in patients with heart failure is 74%. The interplay of frailty and heart failure increases the risk for death, prolonged hospital stays, and functional dependence. One conceptual framework to operationalize frailty is accumulation of deficits: the frailty index (FI). The FI provides a risk score based on the assumption that the more ailments a patient has, the higher the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality. Prior FI models have not been used in routine clinical practice due to the following limitations: insufficient number and range of clinical variables, lack of personalized deficit detection, use of data not commonly found in EHRs, insufficient use of longitudinal analytical models including survival analysis techniques, and the reduction of FI to a cross-sectional health status rather than a health trajectory. Research Aim: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a frailty trajectory (FT) for heart failure patients that provides information integrating prior functional impairment, current functional status, and future risk of mortality. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel cross-sectional FI that uses the full breadth of outpatient EHR data and innovative machine learning data science methods to predict mortality. In Aim 2, we will use serial cross-sectional FIs to build FTs and identify clusters of individuals following a similar progression of frailty over time. In Aim 3, we will compare the prognostic value of cross-sectional FI versus FT. The VA national EHR offers the ideal context for this study, as it provides longitudinal data since 1999 and can link to administrative data from non- VA sources, including linked Medicare databases. Mentoring & environment: A multidisciplinary mentoring team will supervise my training and will oversee my mentored research projects, formal coursework, directed reading, and career development. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for transitioning to an independent quantitative data scientist developing clinical decision aids to guide patient care. Baylor College of Medicine and the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety have a national reputation of mentoring and supporting junior faculty members from diverse academic backgrounds to independent careers as clinical-investigators. Physical frailty is common in adults with heart failure and increases the risk for poor health outcomes. Clinicians need tools to identify adults with physical frailty as part of routine care to support early intervention to treat frailty and reduce this risk. This application seeks to develop a novel measure of physical frailty using data collected as part of routine clinical care and recorded in the electronic health record.",Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure,9953749,K25HL152006,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'American', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Quality of Care', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'data warehouse', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'frailty', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'random forest', 'routine care', 'screening', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K25,2020,143822,0.013419850970035606
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes. This proposal will provide mentored research training to use predictive modeling to improve early diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, and test the delivery of clinical decision support to clinicians through the electronic health record in an implementation trial. This proposal responds to the AHRQ priorities of improving health care quality through use of information systems, improving safety and quality of care by synthesizing and communicating evidence to health care professionals, advances knowledge generation in a learning health system and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs.",Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED),9985019,K08HS025696,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K08,2020,148539,0.010314312570295246
"Understanding Inflammatory Arthritis due to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Project Summary/Abstract The major goals of this proposal are to attain skills required to be an independent clinical and translational researcher in rheumatology and to enhance understanding of a new rheumatic disease, inflammatory arthritis (IA) due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs are revolutionizing cancer treatment but also cause immune related adverse events. ICI-induced IA is the immune related adverse event most likely to be encountered by rheumatologists. ICI-induced IA causes significant morbidity, is clinically heterogeneous, and can persist after ICI cessation. The proposed project will utilize a group of well characterized patients with ICI- induced IA and ICI-treated control patients who do not develop IA to address several important questions. First, the clinical heterogeneity within ICI-induced IA will be evaluated and factors that predict persistence of IA beyond cessation of ICI therapy will be established. Next, clinical and immunogenetic risk factors for developing ICI-induced IA will be determined. Finally, serum cytokine profiles and autoantibodies before and after ICI treatment will be compared in patients with ICI-induced IA and control patients who are treated with ICIs and do not develop IA. These experiments will address key knowledge gaps for this emerging clinical entity. Specifically, defining relevant clinical subgroups will allow for differential monitoring and treatment of patients. Understanding risk factors for development of IA will allow for risk stratification of patients prior to therapy. Cytokines that are elevated in ICI-induced IA patient sera could serve as future therapeutic targets. Finally, understanding presence of autoantibodies and when they develop in the course of ICI treatment will give insight into pathogenesis and identify potential biomarkers. Concurrently with conducting research during the proposal, the candidate will participate in a variety of career development activities taking advantage of the rich resources of Johns Hopkins in the Division of Rheumatology, the Bloomberg Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. The candidate will participate in didactic coursework, conferences, and mentoring meetings with a diverse group of mentors from rheumatology, oncology, laboratory science, and data science. At the end of this award, the candidate will be an independent clinical investigator in the area of cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune disease and will establish a multi- center consortium with standardized data and biospecimen collection for rheumatic irAEs and for patients with preexisting autoimmune disease who are treated with ICIs. Project Narrative This project addresses an increasingly prevalent health condition, inflammatory arthritis due to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for cancer. The proposal will allow for improved diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced inflammatory arthritis.

"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,10007879,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2020,156859,0.014082200190296839
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Drug Treatments and the Impact of COVID-19 on Alzheimer’s Patients and Other Vulnerable Populations Interventions in health policy and care management have the potential to reduce COVID-19 infections and deaths, particularly if they can be targeted to the most vulnerable populations such as patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). In this supplement proposal, we compile information and develop tools that can accelerate and target such interventions. The first aim is to identify the medical and socioeconomic characteristics of people that make them most vulnerable to COVID-19. We create cohorts of patients with ADRD and for other vulnerable populations based on their Fall 2019 characteristics, and follow them through 2020 to identify those at greatest risk of both “direct” COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., critical illness, mortality) and “indirect” increases in non-COVID outcomes. The second aim is an ambitious proof of concept: using natural experiments to shed light on novel drugs to treat or prevent COVID-19 with a particular focus on drugs most heavily used by ADRD patients (e.g., anticholinesterase inhibitors). We will develop and apply a machine learning approach to test the potential effect of drug classes on COVID-19, measured by diagnosis, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. This supplement is made possible by a unique opportunity: Access to near-real-time Medicare claims data (one-month lag), which CMS appears willing to make available through an expedited data use agreement. The application will supplement an ongoing program project on Improving Health Outcome for an Aging Population, whose overarching aim is to better understand health trends and disparities, determinants of health, and approaches to improving health for an aging population in an evolving landscape. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative This administrative supplement seeks to better understand factors mediating (and exacerbating) the impact of COVID-19 on patient cohorts with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and other vulnerable characteristics.

"Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates 7. Project Summary This K23 proposal will provide Xingxing S. Cheng, MD, MS with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Cheng is a board-certified nephrologist and accredited transplant nephrologist, with a long-term vision of improving the effectiveness of health care for kidney transplant patients. She seeks to combine patient-oriented research and decision science to find innovative solutions to clinical problems. Skills she will acquire in this grant, under the guidance of a strong mentorship team, include 1) integration of patient-oriented research and decision analytic models; 2) assessing the heterogeneity of response in different patient subgroups; and 3) advanced modelling skills. This grant proposes to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease on the wait-list awaiting kidney transplantation. Currently, patients undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, few of which result in interventions. These tests impose a high treatment burden on patients and potentially delay time to transplant, while bringing unclear benefit to the patient. This grant proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients with diabetes mellitus). It will examine strategies that vary the frequency of cardiac testing and risk stratification for cardiac testing based on a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive test that can be performed in routine clinical settings, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). This project will achieve this broad aim by three specific aims: 1) to characterize the 6MWT in identifying low-risk patients who do not additional cardiac testing; 2) to model strategies varying the frequency of cardiac testing and use of 6MWT; 3) to design strategies personalized for specific patient subgroups and model them in the entire kidney transplant candidate population of the United States (US). The first two aims will arise from a well-characterized cohort of patients at Dr. Cheng’s institution. Machine-learning systems will be used to identify which patient subgroups are best served by which strategies (i.e. the heterogeneity of response). The third aim will leverage the US Renal Data System, which Dr. Cheng’s mentors and institution has a track record of leveraging for innovative research. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant clinical impact. Its completion will enable the identification and characterization of rational strategies for pre-transplant screening of coronary artery disease that may be incorporated into clinical practice or pave the way for a future multi-center comparative effectiveness trial. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and will allow Dr. Cheng to build research skills, advance and disseminate scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative networks, and compete for R01 or equivalent funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful independent clinical investigator. 8. Project Narrative Currently, patients on the kidney transplant waitlist undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, but relatively few interventions result. This project proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients without diabetes mellitus), by examining strategies that reduce the frequency of cardiac testing and use performance-based risk stratification to reduce the number of patients who need cardiac testing.

"SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in technology, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare costs in the U.S. Yet, there is a tremendous gap in accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in CVD risks and outcomes for disaggregated Hispanic and Asian subgroups. The current cardiovascular risk assessment tools have not been well-validated in these diverse populations, and it remains largely unknown why minority patients are less likely to start and more likely to stop life-saving therapies. The overall goal of Dr. Rodriguez’s K01 application is to address gaps in knowledge about CVD prediction and treatment in understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. The proposed study will utilize the electronic health record (EHR) data from an established NHLBI-funded cohort enriched with disaggregated Hispanic and Asian patients. Using this cohort, Dr. Rodriguez will first test the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups using a large diverse mixed-payer cohort of 1,234,751 patients from two large healthcare systems in Northern California and Hawaii. Secondly, she will build new CVD risk prediction models for diverse patient subgroups using machine learning techniques. Finally, she will identify reasons for statin underuse and discontinuation using natural language processing in the EHR. This study, which will evaluate existing data from real-world clinical practice in a stable population, will inform future risk prediction models and cholesterol treatment guidelines for diverse racial/ethnic groups. The proposal is aligned with the NHBLI’s strategic goals to eliminate health disparities and inequities by leveraging epidemiology and data science to understand and solve complex health problems. This proposal will also prepare Dr. Rodriguez to meet her long-term goal of becoming a national leader and independent investigator in CVD prevention and minority health. The proposed didactic and applied data science experiences, including training in advanced epidemiological methods and machine learning, will prepare Dr. Rodriguez to apply her research to other areas of CVD prevention and populations. This training program builds on the strengths of Stanford University in health services research, epidemiology, and biomedical informatics. Her mentorship team, led by Dr. Latha Palaniappan, includes experts in cardiovascular prevention and health services research (Dr. Heidenreich, co-mentor), applied statistical analyses (Dr. Robert Tibshirani, advisor), machine learning in the EHR (Dr. Nigam Shah, advisor), and chronic disease prediction and medical decision making (Dr. Michael Pignone, advisor). Dr. Rodriguez’s team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal as well as overseeing her advanced training in their respective areas of expertise. The research and training plan proposed in this K01 application will develop Dr. Rodriguez into a unique and highly-skilled clinician researcher ready to compete for R-level funding and launch her independent research career. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S., yet current CVD risk prediction algorithms fail to adequately assess risk in these populations.

"Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Michael Mathis is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology and advanced perioperative echocardiography at the University of Michigan. Through completion of a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr. Mathis has developed expertise in perioperative outcomes research for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease. His long-term career goal is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF) through harnessing perioperative electronic healthcare record (EHR) data for early diagnosis and management. This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance Statement: Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting over 550,000 patients each year, with a 45–60% mortality rate at 5 years. Despite advances in treatment, little progress has been made to improve heart failure diagnosis, and thus patients in early heart failure stages do not receive appropriate life-extending therapies. Through robust data science methodologies, this study harnesses critically underutilized, high-fidelity data available during the perioperative period to improve diagnosis of heart failure .",Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach,9895469,K01HL141701,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Board Certification', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'blood pressure variability', 'care providers', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2020,172274,0.005124359876461992
"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (“tele-SUD”) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder,10169552,R01DA048533,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental disorders', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'methamphetamine use', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'physically handicapped', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'rural area', 'screening', 'treatment duration']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,174599,-0.0013260053219310433
"Characterizing patients at risk for sepsis through Big Data Characterizing Patients at Risk for Sepsis Through Big Data SUMMARY The goal of this KL2 research proposal is create an extension of an existing data-driven sepsis algorithm, the artificial intelligence sepsis expert (AISE), by forecasting the type and sequence of sepsis-specific organ failure using clinical data from the electronic medical record, then identifying the incremental benefit received by adding high-resolution data derived from cardiovascular waveforms (arterial waveform and electrocardiographic waves), and small molecule metabolite data over time to provide some mechanistic context. The most important data (features) used in real-time from AISE will be used as inputs for a fuzzy k- means clustering algorithm (“Saving Organs from Sepsis”, or SOS) using retrospectively-collected data, designed to better characterize patients at risk for sepsis by their organ failure. I have selected three organs in particular: shock, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI). Principal component analyses (PCA) data from 2,375 ICU patients with sepsis will be projected onto a novel visual representation for patient phenotyping based on risk of (trajectory toward) different types of organ failure. I will identify if this SOS algorithm can accurately forecast new organ failure within 12 hours based on SOS. To better understand the impact of specific features on organ failure, I will test the ability of each high- resolution features, and metabolomics data to forecast septic shock. Among those who develop septic shock, I will measure all nine high-resolution features from the beginning of the ICU stay up to shock onset and compare those changes to those who develop sepsis but not septic shock, and those who do not develop sepsis. I will then see if the collective addition of high-resolution data improves performance of septic shock forecasting. Finally, I will conduct a prospective observational study to collect metabolomic information in a 60- patient study to identify the incremental improvement of adding metabolomics data to SOS for predicting septic shock, over SOS with just EMR and waveform data. The results of this work will provide preliminary data for further career development and NIH-funding. The long-term goal would be to build a model that optimizes the timing of appropriate therapy, thus decreasing the incidence of sepsis and associated organ failure. As a K23 candidate, I will use this award to acquire formal didactic training and more hands-on experience in machine learning, signal processing, metabolomics analysis. I will seek focused training that will complement my experience as a clinical trialist so that I can design high-quality studies to contribute to Big Data analytics in critical care research and practice. My overarching career goal is to become a leader in the application of Big Data analysis of critically ill patients to predict progression of disease, specifically sepsis. The Emory environment is an ideal place to develop these capabilities. Emory Healthcare houses over 200 medical, surgical, and subspecialty ICU beds, many of which are “wired” to store streaming data. In addition to the physical resources, my development will be enhanced by my superb mentorship team, led by Dr. Greg Martin. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis, the body’s response to a life-threatening infection that causes damage to itself, is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and around the world, and failure of vital organs is one of the biggest contributors. This project is designed to predict organ failure specific to sepsis using cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology using readily-available information, and experimental blood tests.

"Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data PROJECT SUMMARY Large electronic health record research (EHR) data integrated with -omics data from linked biorepositories have expanded opportunities for precision medicine research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based personalized cancer risk and progression prediction models, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice and ultimately realize the promise of precision oncology. However, efficiently and effectively using EHR for cancer research remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, obtaining precise event time information such as time of cancer recurrence is a major bottleneck in using EHR for precision medicine research due to the requirement of laborious medical record review and the lack of documentation. Simple estimates of the event time based on billing or procedure codes may poorly approximate the true event time. Naive use of such estimated event times can lead to highly biased estimates due to the approximation error. Such biases impose challenges to performing pragmatic trials when the study endpoint is time to events and captured using EHR. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill these methodological gaps in risk assessment for cancer research using EHR data, which will advance our ability to achieve the promise of precision oncology. Statistical algorithms and software will be developed to (i) automatically assign event time information using longitudinally recorded EHR information; and (ii) to perform accurate risk assessment using noisy proxies of event times. The proposed tools for risk assessment using imperfect EHR data without requiring extensive manual chart review could greatly improve the utility of EHR for oncology research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal addresses major methodological gaps in effectively utilizing EHR data for risk assessment due to the noisy nature of EHR data. We propose novel statistical algorithms and software to (i) efficiently annotate event time by combining multiple longitudinally recorded code information and (ii) to provide precise risk estimates using noisy proxies of event times. By drawing upon the rich albeit imperfect data from bio-repository linked EHR, our algorithms will advance our ability to use EHR data for precision oncology research.",Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data,9955220,R21CA242940,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Boston', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Proxy', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'adjudicate', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2020,177510,-0.02045202327318111
"Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions Project Summary/Abstract Atrial Fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and accounts for roughly 15% of all strokes in the United States. Many individuals may have undiagnosed AF whose arrhythmia does not prompt evaluation either because of minimal symptoms or brief episodes. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is highly effective at reducing stroke risk in patients with AF, but is only prescribed to individuals with recognized disease. Identifying subjects with undiagnosed AF is important so they may be treated with OAC and prevent strokes from occurring. This project will help advance our knowledge of screening patients for undiagnosed AF in the primary care setting by identifying patients at high risk of developing AF for targeted clinic and home-based screening strategies. Fundamental questions of who to target and how to implement a screening program in the United States remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic and content area training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To identify predictors of AF incidence from electronic health record structured and free-text data, 2) To develop and implement an electronic algorithm that improves upon existing models to identify patients at increased risk for AF in a primary care population, and 3) To implement and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of a clinic and home-based screening program to identify undiagnosed AF. This project aligns with several objectives of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Strategic Vision by implementing novel diagnostic tools to diagnose AF and prevent strokes, by optimizing clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease, and leveraging emerging opportunities in data science, through the use of natural language processing of text data in the electronic health record, to improve identification of patients at high risk for AF. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in cardiovascular disease and targeting populations for prevention of cardiovascular disease events. Career development activities include training in biomedical informatics, data mining and risk prediction, survey research design, implementation research, and cardiovascular disease pathophysiology and clinical management through formal coursework, clinical shadowing, as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will improve prediction of which patients are at the highest risk of developing AF, and evaluate how to use this risk information to implement an effective screening strategy in primary care. Pilot data from this award will lay the groundwork for a highly competitive application for NIH R01 funding. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke and the prevalence is estimated to increase from 5.2 million adults in the United States to more than 12 million by 2030, however, many additional individuals have undiagnosed disease. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, by 1) improving identification of patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation, and 2) targeting patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation in the primary care setting with an efficient strategy for clinic and home-based screening. This program will significantly increase knowledge of how to overcome the real-world issue of how to effectively and efficiently screen for atrial fibrillation in clinical practice.",Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions,9982695,K01HL148506,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Senior Scientist', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data registry', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient screening', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk minimization', 'screening', 'screening program', 'stroke risk', 'structured data', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2020,177770,0.00981906723778816
"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.'s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group's online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH's focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, but less than 20% of individuals receive treatment. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” for increasing mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders, with study data being used to optimize the chatbot for a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",9955368,K08MH120341,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exposure to', 'Facebook', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Participant', 'Partnership Practice', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Services', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'chatbot', 'comorbidity', 'computer program', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health service use', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'multiphase optimization strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'service delivery', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'success', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'web site']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,179096,0.00405769261871715
"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury,10030705,R01NS117921,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'Americas', 'Amnesia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Elements', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural regeneration', 'Ontario', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Province', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'assault', 'behavioral/social science', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disability', 'expectation', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'gender disparity', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'injury recovery', 'injury surveillance', 'interest', 'medically necessary care', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'vehicular accident', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2020,185878,-0.005503096828129478
"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response. These are critical steps toward improving infant health outcomes through both targeted treatment of infection and reduced unnecessary early-life antibiotic exposures.",Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood,9861218,K23AI139337,"['Acute-Phase Proteins', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood Proteins', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fetal Development', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Haptoglobins', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Infant Health', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Mycoses', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal Infection', 'Placenta', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Sepsis', 'Serum Proteins', 'Serum amyloid A protein', 'Set protein', 'Side', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adverse outcome', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'differential expression', 'early onset', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fetal', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant morbidity', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbiome alteration', 'neonatal infection', 'neonatal outcome', 'neonatal sepsis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'research and development', 'research study', 'sex', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational research program']",NIAID,LURIE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO,K23,2020,189950,-0.0022981362403605007
"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9999582,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2020,190000,-0.01771814872902465
"EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy Project Summary Dr. Jennifer A. Kim is a critical care neurologist and neuroscientist at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded translational investigator with expertise in signal processing of neurophysiologic and neuroimaging data to identify early biomarkers of secondary brain injury in critically ill patients, particularly related to post-traumatic epilepsy. Post-traumatic epilepsy is a disabling complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is an urgent need to find biomarkers of post-traumatic epilepsy to identify patients at high risk for developing this complication. It is a population in which early biomarker identification could improve patient monitoring and ultimately treatment development to circumvent epileptogenesis. Post- traumatic epilepsy contributes to worsening of the already high rates of TBI morbidity, disability and cost of care, thus emphasizing the importance of preventing this complication. We need to find biomarkers to best define those most likely to benefit from potential treatments and make such treatment discovery trials more feasible. During the proposed training period, the candidate will expand upon her knowledge of EEG signal processing and machine learning techniques and acquire new skills in neuroimaging analysis using Magnetic Resonance technologies and biostatistics. To accomplish this, Dr. Kim has brought together a strong mentorship team of Dr. Hal Blumenfeld (primary mentor) and co-mentors Drs. Todd Constable, Brandon Westover and Brian Edlow who have expertise in multi-modal approaches to studying epilepsy, functional MRI analysis, computational EEG analysis and structural TBI imaging, respectively. Under their mentorship, Dr. Kim proposes to: 1) quantify epileptiform abnormality (EA) frequency and identify EA waveform features that optimally predict PTE, 2) determine if direct hippocampal injury, assessed by cortical thickness and contusion volume, stratifies PTE risk 3) assess whether indirect hippocampal injury, based on structural and functional MRI connectivity analyses, portend PTE. The overall goal is to identify early biomarkers of patients at high risk for post-traumatic epilepsy to target development of anti-epileptogenesis treatments. Bringing together advanced neurophysiologic and neuroimaging analysis and this strong mentorship support, this project opens new avenues for optimizing follow-up care and advancing potential treatment development for all traumatic brain injury patients at risk for post-traumatic epilepsy. This well-defined patient-oriented research proposal, in concert with the mentorship and structured didactic curriculum, will provide Dr. Kim with the skills that are essential to develop an independent career in neurophysiological and neuroimaging research that translates to improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Post-traumatic epilepsy, a seizure disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI), is among the most disabling and difficult-to-treat complications of TBI. Currently, there are no tools to identify patients a priori at highest risk for PTE. Dr. Kim's proposed career development plan has great potential to advance our knowledge of the acute biomarkers of PTE using EEG and MRI, to improve early identification and ultimately provide treatment options for this potentially preventable complication.",EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy,10055272,K23NS112596,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Atrophic', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blinded', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Complication', 'Contusions', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Prevention trial', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Rodent Model', 'Sclerosis', 'Secondary to', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'care costs', 'career', 'career development', 'cost estimate', 'didactic education', 'disability', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'human imaging', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'preventable epilepsy', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,192780,-0.033269933782345
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,10001486,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social determinants', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2020,192914,-0.012492691822501071
"Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants PROJECT SUMMARY Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening, gastrointestinal (GI) emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. ""Leaky gut"", or intestinal barrier immaturity with elevated intestinal permeability (IP), is the proximate cause of susceptibility to NEC in preterm neonates. Early detection of leaky gut is essential to identify infants at risk for NEC to prevent and reduce disease severity. No clinical factor, routine laboratory test or biomarker alone or in combination have been described that identify preterm neonates with impaired intestinal barrier function who at increased risk for NEC. The goal of this study is to develop a rapid, non-invasive screening tool to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. We recently revealed rapid maturation of the intestinal barrier is strongly associated with clinical factors such as early breastmilk feeding, less antibiotic exposure and later post-menstrual age, and significantly higher abundance and metabolic activities of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Although the butyrate producing Clostridiales have been implicated in strengthening the intestinal epithelial barrier and reducing intestinal inflammation, it is unknown whether butyrate and potentially other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with neonatal intestinal barrier maturation. Our preliminary data revealed butyrate production pathways, in particular Pyruvate/Acetyl-CoA pathway are significantly more abundant in low IP subjects. In this study, we propose to validate a substantiated measure of fecal microbial and/or metabolic biomarkers combined with associated neonatal factors for a rapid, non-invasive screening test. We postulate that the level(s) of metabolic activities, particularly butyrate production and potentially other SCFAs via increased colonization of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium, are associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates. To address our hypothesis, we will leverage existed stool samples collected from a cohort of ~200 preterms (<33 weeks), for whom both microbiota (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and IP (urine non-metabolized sugar probes lactulose and rhamnose) are available, and propose 2 aims: 1) to determine fecal metabolic activities associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates <33 weeks gestation; and 2) to identify and characterize butyrate-producing bacteria associated with intestinal permeability in preterm neonates during the first 7-10 days of life. At the completion of the study, we will determine the biomarkers associated with healthy intestinal barrier functions and the discriminatory scheme for accurate classification of high or low IP group. Our long-term goal is to conduct a randomize clinical trial of rationally designed intervention for NEC early prevention. Refinement of the screening tool will identify infants with aberrant leaky gut, an essential prerequisite for subsequent rational design of novel strategies such as clinical trials of probiotics to promote healthy intestinal barrier functions to reduce NEC incidence. PROJECT NARRATIVE ""Leaky gut"", is the proximate cause of susceptibility to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening, gastrointestinal emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. This proposal will develop and validate a rapid, non-invasive screening test incorporating microbiome-based markers and associated neonatal factors, to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. The results of this study will support clinical trials aimed to optimize intestinal maturation and to reduce the burden of NEC complications. This study will address major knowledge gaps of the intestinal microenvironment in preterm infants, and ultimately lead to improved strategies to manage neonatal gastrointestinal health, improve children’s health and quality of life, all which are within the mission of NIDDK.",Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants,10018932,R21DK123674,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anabolism', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Butyrates', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Milk', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lactulose', 'Lead', 'Leaky Gut', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Necrosis', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Pyruvate', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Urine', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'early screening', 'feeding', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'insight', 'intestinal barrier', 'intestinal epithelium', 'intestinal maturation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mucosal microbiota', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preterm newborn', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sex', 'stool sample', 'sugar', 'supervised learning', 'therapy design']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2020,193125,-0.009030841220703184
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this ﬁeld typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind admis- sion risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modiﬁable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital ad- missions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classiﬁcation models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to signiﬁcantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close men- toring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a support- ive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identiﬁcation and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,9906933,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical center', 'clinical encounter', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'social', 'statistical learning', 'structured data', 'supportive environment', 'trend', 'trial design', 'unstructured data']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2020,194806,-0.015496547354744301
"The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms Project Summary Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, an important developmental period during which higher education, first jobs, and relationships are pursued. Recurrent mood episodes during this period can have a devastating impact on a young person's ability to achieve a high quality of life as an adult. A method by which to predict the onset of mood symptoms in adolescence would create an opportunity to intervene and reduce exposure to the harmful effects of recurrent episodes. A new approach – digital phenotyping – may make this possible. Digital phenotyping is defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors (accelerometer, texts, calls, GPS). Digital phenotyping has been used to identify mood changes and potential signs of relapse in adults with BD, but has not yet been applied to adolescents. We will use Beiwe, a digital phenotyping application for iOS and Android phones, to collect digital phenotypes from participants (aged 14-19) over 18-months (N=120; n=70 with BD [I, II, Other Specified], n=50 typically-developing). Over the follow-up period, participants will complete biweekly mood assessments, and both participants and caregivers will be interviewed monthly to track changes in mood/behavior. This will allow the phone sensor data collected with Beiwe to be closely linked to symptom changes. The specific aims of this project are (1) to characterize the digital phenotype of BD symptoms in adolescents, (2) to describe differences in the digital phenotypes of the BD and typically developing groups, and (3) to develop a model for predicting mood symptoms prospectively. The proposed study is consistent with all four NIMH strategic objectives for the future of mental health research. This K23 Award will provide Anna Van Meter, PhD with the necessary training and mentorship to (1) gain proficiency in computational psychiatry by learning to analyze longitudinal data using statistical and machine learning techniques, (2) build expertise in patient-oriented translational research by designing and conducting a longitudinal study with youth participants; (3) learn to employ state-of-the-art mobile technology to personalize assessment and intervention using patient data. To accomplish these training goals, Dr. Van Meter has organized an outstanding mentorship team (Anil Malhotra, MD, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, DSc, John Kane, MD, Christoph Correll, MD, and Deborah Estrin, PhD), with expertise in patient-oriented research, technology-based mental health research, computational psychiatry, bipolar disorder in youth, and computer science. The proposed study will be the first to describe the digital phenotype of BD in adolescents, a population at great risk for the onset of BD as well as the damaging effects of repeated episodes. The completion of the proposed K23 Mentored Career Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research, and will provide Dr. Van Meter with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator pursuing novel technological solutions to improve patients' quality of life.

"Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Zafar is a neurointensivist and clinical neurophysiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, whose goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic clinical trials using neurophysiologic tools, to improve outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries and seizures. Epileptiform abnormalities (seizures and seizure-like rhythmic patterns) are seen on electroencephalography (EEG) in up to 40% of acute brain injury patients and are associated with worse outcomes. Due to lack of evidence-based guidance, patients with epileptiform abnormalities are often aggressively treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), exposing them to AED related adverse effects that may worsen outcomes. Dr. Zafar's preliminary data shows that increasing burden of epileptiform abnormalities in patients with hemorrhagic stroke is associated with worse outcomes. Up to half these patients receive AED treatment with no improvement in outcomes, and AED use itself is independently associated with worse outcomes. Dr. Zafar has built a comprehensive EEG database of 2000 patients to investigate AED effectiveness. In her career development plan, she will be using the rich neurophysiologic data in the EEG database, along with a nationwide dataset (Premier Healthcare Database) to study AED and EEG utilization patterns and AED effectiveness in a “real-clinical world” setting. Under the mentorship of Dr. M. Bradon Westover, and co-mentors (Dr. John Hsu, Dr. Elisabetta Patorno, and Dr. Hang Lee), Dr. Zafar proposes to: 1) Determine which specific epileptiform abnormalities show an acute response to AEDs by assessing neurological improvement within 24 hours of treatment (EEG database), 2) Assess the impact of AEDs on in- hospital clinical adverse outcomes and discharge functional outcomes in acute brain injury patients with epileptiform abnormalities (EEG database), 3) Investigate how AED-related adverse outcomes vary with practice patterns across hospitals with different resources and EEG utilization patterns (Premier Database). Dr. Zafar will perform a systematic exploration of the EEG database to determine EEG phenotypes associated with response to AED treatment, and determine the impact of AEDs on in-hospital adverse outcomes (e.g. mortality, hepatotoxicity, cardiac events). To account for national variation in AED prescription, hospital resources and EEG use, Dr. Zafar will examine adverse outcomes in the Premier Database. In addition to the proposed research, Dr. Zafar's career development plan includes a Masters of Science and coursework on analysis of large databases, pharmacoepidemiology and machine learning. Dr. Zafar will receive guidance from her mentors and advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow Dr. Zafar to establish a niche in using neurophysiologic data in comparative effectiveness research and launch an independent research career aimed at improving neurologic outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries. Project Narrative Although patients admitted with brain injuries such as stroke and traumatic brain injury are at high risk for developing seizures, physicians have very limited information to guide anti-epileptic drug management in such patients. This results in frequent overuse of anti-epileptic mediations that are also known to have harmful side effects. Dr. Zafar's proposed project will significantly advance our knowledge on which patients benefit the most from treatment and which patients are at highest risk for harmful side effects, providing guidance for physicians in making treatment decisions that will improve outcomes in the thousands of brain injury patients admitted to US hospitals each year.",Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury,10019612,K23NS114201,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'General Hospitals', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master of Science', 'Mediation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological Models', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Variant', 'active comparator', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'disorder subtype', 'evidence base', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'neurophysiology', 'patient subsets', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'side effect', 'skills', 'stroke patient', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2020,200880,-0.021685661031617114
"Identifying Protective and Risk Factors for Non-infectious Uveitis Project Summary/Abstract Background Information and Relevance: Uveitis is an important cause of permanent vision loss that affects younger patients. Despite the human and economic impact of this disease, the risk factors for non-infectious uveitis are poorly understood. This is in part because epidemiologic studies of uveitis have been limited by insufficient numbers of participants. Newly available large health care claims databases provide an opportunity to increase the ability to detect uveitis risk factors. Hypotheses: Metformin, statin, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with a lower incidence of non-infectious uveitis, while female hormonal therapies are associated with a higher incidence of non-infectious uveitis. Specific Objectives: 1. To determine if non-infectious uveitis incidence varies in relation to putative protective medications, including metformin, statins and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. 2. To determine if non-infectious uveitis incidence varies in relation the modifiable risk factor of female hormonal therapy, including hormonal replacement therapy and hormonal contraceptive therapy. Methods: The Clinformatics™ Data Mart Database contains medical claims on over 60 million beneficiaries from a large insurer in the United States. We will define non-infectious uveitis based on validated diagnosis codes recorded by an eye care provider twice within a 120-day period and exclusion of infectious or surgical causes of uveitis with diagnosis and procedural codes. Potential confounders including demographic (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education level, financial net worth) and clinical (smoking exposure) covariate information will be extracted from the database. Medication exposure will be rigorously captured based on the filling of outpatient prescriptions or coding of clinic-administered therapies. The cohort not exposed to the medication will be matched on age (±3 years), race/ethnicity, sex and date of plan entry and exit (±3 months) to the medication-exposed cohort. Propensity scores for each medication exposure will be estimated using multivariable logistic regression and the rich information on comorbid conditions and treatments available in the database. With multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, we will calculate the hazard ratios for incident non-infectious uveitis based on exposure to each of the medications listed above. To account for the possibility of systematic differences between individuals with and without the exposures of interest, the Cox proportional hazards models will be weighted by the inverse of the predicted probability of their observed exposures using the propensity scores. We will interpret the results taking into the account the multiple comparisons being tested. Implications: The well-powered, rigorous analyses proposed here offer a unique opportunity to identify novel modifiable protective and risk factors for non-infectious uveitis, guide practice patterns for discontinuation of medications that increase uveitis risk, and inform the development of clinical trials for medications for secondary uveitis prevention. Project Narrative Uveitis is an eye disease that causes blindness disproportionately in young and working-age Americans, and we do not completely understand the risk factors for developing uveitis. Our study aims to uncover the risk factors for uveitis, including whether some medications may play a role in uveitis risk. The insights gained could improve the treatment and prevention of uveitis recurrence.",Identifying Protective and Risk Factors for Non-infectious Uveitis,9850573,R21EY029851,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Mart', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Drug usage', 'Educational Background', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Female', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Investigation', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metformin', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outpatients', 'Panuveitis', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Play', 'Population Study', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Privatization', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Race', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Weight', 'age related', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care providers', 'clinical development', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disorder risk', 'economic impact', 'epidemiology study', 'hazard', 'high risk population', 'hormonal contraception', 'hormone therapy', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'prevention clinical trial', 'protective factors', 'sex']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R21,2020,205802,-0.007083610029365735
"Using Causal Inference and Machine Learning Methods to Predict Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Response PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many patients with anxiety and fear disorders (AFDs) report minimal benefits when treated with an evidence- based psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) or pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants; benzodiazepines). Conversely, some AFD patients are likely to benefit from virtually any treatment (e.g., supportive therapy). Using data collected in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there has been limited progress determining how to use pre-treatment characteristics to match AFD patients to the treatment that is most likely to provide benefit. As a result, NIMH has forwarded Strategic Objectives focused on identifying treatment moderators and developing tools that predict differential treatment response. The broad goal of this proposed secondary data analysis is to apply causal inference and machine learning methods to prospective observational data to predict differential treatment response among patients with AFDs. The sample (n = 1,528) is from a longstanding NIMH-funded study of AFD patients who received: (a) CBT with concurrent pharmacotherapy, (b) CBT without pharmacotherapy, or (c) treatment as usual (TAU). Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (a causal inference method) and super learning (an ensemble machine learning method) will be used to accomplish the proposed Aims. Aim 1 will estimate the (overall) average effects of the three treatment types. Aim 2 will estimate “optimal treatment rules” to determine if differential treatment response can be meaningfully predicted based on a patient's multidimensional profile of pre-treatment symptoms. Aim 3 will estimate “optimal treatment rules” to determine if differential treatment response can be meaningfully predicted using all available pre-treatment covariates. The proposed study is highly innovative and could significantly impact the growing literature focused on predicting differential treatment effects and personalizing treatment for patients with AFDs. Although treatment effects estimates obtained using observational data and causal inference methods (i.e., adjusted for nonrandom treatment selection) are similar to those estimated in RCTs, this would be the first study to apply such methods to AFD patient data. This study will also be the first to use ensemble machine learning to develop composite moderators for AFDs (i.e., optimal treatment rules). In comparison, prior attempts to develop composite moderators have relied on less flexible model-building procedures prone to overfitting and unable to capture complex predictor-outcome associations (e.g., interactions among predictors; nonlinear associations). In achieving the proposed Aims, the current study would be a catalyst for future research using causal inference and machine learning to study predictors of differential treatment response among AFD patients. Results will be used to justify future research aimed at expanding and validating the models in larger observational samples and pragmatic RCTs (e.g., optimal treatment rules for specific medications/doses; timing of pharmacotherapy relative to CBT; second-wave CBT versus acceptance-based CBT). PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with anxiety and fear disorders may benefit only from certain evidence-based treatments, while others may benefit from virtually any treatment (e.g., talk therapy). The current study will use casual inference and machine learning methods to develop predictive models that identify the treatment(s) most likely to benefit a particular patient. The models developed in this study will serve as an important initial step toward efficient and personalized treatment for patients with anxiety and fear disorders.",Using Causal Inference and Machine Learning Methods to Predict Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Response,9912204,R21MH119492,"['Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Assessment tool', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life Stress', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Onset of illness', 'Outpatients', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Procedures', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'anxiety treatment', 'base', 'catalyst', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'excessive anxiety', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'model building', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'sociodemographics', 'stress reactivity', 'symptom treatment', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment disparity', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2020,207977,-0.0005601848861113581
"Secure Homomorphically Encrypted National Registry of COVID-19 Recovered Plasma Donors PROJECT SUMMARY Treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) was recently approved by the FDA for seriously ill patients of COVID-19. There are many institutions and hospitals that have implemented CP programs, but they all face the challenge of finding sufficient and appropriate donors. The constraints of matching, imbalances in supply and demand, and privacy concerns pose several challenges to engage donors. Considering multiple stakeholders (patients, donors, hospitals), we will develop new algorithms based on multikey homomorphic encryption to protect the privacy of patients and donors, with additional functionality to simplify the registration process, and conduct optimization for plasma donation (of patients who recovered from COVID-19). We are dedicated to the public good and will make freely available the code / resources developed within the framework of this project. If we succeed, our project will build a secure national registry for potential plasma donors and may save many lives. Narrative We are proposing a novel platform for convalescent plasma donation with integrated privacy protection and resource optimization. The goal is to remove the barriers and concerns for COVID-19 recovered patients to donate their plasma to save severely ill patients.

"Wireless withdrawal detection and monitoring system for neonatal abstinence syndrome. SPECIFIC AIMS Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is an opioid withdrawal syndrome that develops shortly after birth to in utero-exposed neonates. The cost of NAS is high: newborns with NAS are typically receive care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), where the daily cost of care is high. Nearly 22,000 infants are born with NAS each year at a cost of $1.5 billion. Moreover, medication-based interventions for the treatment of NAS, used in up to 80% of opioid-exposed infants, carry their own risks of toxicity and drug interactions. Despite the medical cost, high societal impact of NAS, and the risks of treatment, the tools to assess the severity of NAS can be subjective and suffer from examiner bias. There is an urgent need for innovative new methods to diagnose NAS and assess the efficacy of responses to treatment. Flexible, low-cost wearable devices (worn on the skin) that can report measures of systemic biochemical and biomechanical processes offer a simple and economical solution. In NAS, surges of sympathetic nervous system activity produce increased heart rate, skin conductance, unstable temperature, and tremor. These manifest in increased infant sweating, seizures, tremors, unstable body temperature, and more—events that must continually monitored and assessed by nurses. The unsupervised, objective detection/quantification of the bodily response of neonates suffering from NAS could drive the development of new, objective scoring tools that can guide the initiation, intensity, and duration of therapies for NAS. Such tools could significantly reduce medical costs and improve patient outcomes by reducing patient time in NICU, reducing nurse load, improving outpatient monitoring, and helping to assist in the optimization of patient treatments. Critically, we believe such a tool may be able to objectively capture events that may go unnoticed by nurses or while the infant is sleeping (minor tremors, poor oxygenation, temperature fluctuations, dehydration). This proposal seeks to develop interlinked, infant-targeted wearable biosensor-systems capable of continuously monitoring the biochemical to biophysical parameters of opioid-dependent neonates under treatment for NAS. Our team has outstanding experience in all areas necessary to this investigation. Our business unit has extensive NIH funded experience in wearable biosensing, in the detection of sympathetic nervous system activity in opioid withdrawal, pediatrics, business development, and intellectual property. Our academic partners have broad experience in novel biosensor development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rekovar is developing a low cost wearable device that integrates wirelessly with a mobile device to allow real- time monitoring of the baby’s physical and physiological state and its ability to sleep, eat, and be nurtured while undergoing neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). This device has significant impact in helping reduce both hospital stay and costs as neonates receiving pharmacological treatment are usually in the NICU away from family and non-pharmacological care. Our interest lies with respect to proper neonatal care, where separate procedures occur for essential neonatal needs and needs for neonates undergoing withdrawal, and by using this monitoring device to assess addicted neonates undergoing withdrawal, caregivers are provided the better ability of treating the right neonatal needs with the appropriate procedure in hospitals.",Wireless withdrawal detection and monitoring system for neonatal abstinence syndrome.,10013069,R41DA049615,"['Accelerometer', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Biometry', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Temperature', 'Breathing', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chest', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Engineering', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Interactions', 'Eating', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hydration status', 'Infant', 'Intellectual Property', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nurses', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sneezing', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome', 'Sweating', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tremor', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Withdrawal', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'care costs', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'handheld mobile device', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microchip', 'monitoring device', 'nanofabrication', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'neuromuscular activity', 'novel', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid withdrawal', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prenatal exposure', 'printed circuit board', 'real time monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'therapy duration', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,REKOVAR INC.,R41,2020,225000,0.009224402938725345
"SPEEKO for Elderspeak: A Self-Monitoring App to Improve Communication and Reduce Behavioral Symptoms in Care for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias PROJECT ABSTRACT  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk that is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. To increase dissemination, this effective classroom-based training has been transformed to online internet modules that improve access for busy staff including those in rural and small NHs and increase ease of dissemination across long term care service settings. To further enhance training effects, SPEEKO for Elderspeak, an automated performance-based app that uses natural language processing has been developed to provide immediate reinforcement of training to staff at the point-of care. This study will build on app proof of concept to establish feasibility of use in the clinical setting and will test preliminary efficacy of the app for augmenting the effect of training on reducing elderspeak communication in dementia care.  This R21 will conduct a clinical trial in response to PAR-18-179; Research on Informal and Formal Caregiving for Alzheimer’s Disease by testing a technology-based, natural language processing app to support caregivers in addressing unique challenges of providing advanced dementia care. We will demonstrate feasibility of use at the point-of-care with five certified nursing assistants, and further validate the app’s accuracy by comparing app outputs reporting diminutive use to results from transcription and psycholinguistic coding. Hypothesized app effects on augmenting reductions in staff elderspeak diminutive use after training will be tested in a cluster randomized trial comparing immediate and delayed feedback with 60 CNAs in 6 nursing homes. If effective in boosting training effects, this readily scalable app can be disseminated across long term care service and support settings to increase communication training effects that will reduce resident BPSD and psychotropic medication use and provide periodic reinforcement for communication training.

"SUDCare: A smart mobile tool to support substance use screening and follow-up care PROJECT SUMMARY Substance use disorder (SUD) is a significant public health challenge that costs the US over $740 billion annually and lacks the current workforce to address it. Our proposed innovation, SUDCare, is a novel and intelligent mobile application that will be designed to address the pressing needs of primary care patients who have inadequate resources and services for SUD screening and follow-up care. The core components of the proposed innovation will consist of a remote screening tool for the assessment of patients’ risk level of SUD and a chatbot to support logistical and routine queries. Our research team will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to create a scalable and sustainable solution to support an evidence-based SUD screening and treatment protocol. SUDCare has the potential to streamline follow-up clinic encounters and minimize the increasing workload burden placed on PCPs while filling a largely unfilled gap in care for hard-to- reach populations not directly served by any SUD therapeutic solutions available today. The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to test technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of SUDCare. We will accomplish this goal using a user-centered design framework following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will conduct semi- structured formative interviews with stakeholders (i.e., primary care providers, nurses, care coordinators, insurers, health IT specialists) and potential target end users (i.e., patients) (Substudy 1, N=20) recruited from our partnering primary care clinic. The data collected from this Substudy will be used to support the SUDCare development and requirements for integration with clinic workflow and systems. In Aim 2, we will build a working prototype of SUDCare. To create the chatbot prototype, we will train an English language model using a rich, existing de-identified dataset of text-message conversations from previous related work. Finally, in Aim 3, we will assess the acceptability of SUDCare through usability testing conducted with patients at risk of SUD (Substudy 2, N=8). Results from Phase I will inform a potential Phase II project to further develop SUDCare and conduct a larger-scaled pilot study to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of SUDCare. PROJECT NARRATIVE Substance use disorder (SUD) is a growing trend in the United States, and primary care providers have limited resources to help patients with prevention and treatment. In this Phase I SBIR, we will employ a user-centered design approach to develop and demonstrate the acceptability and feasibility of an innovative mobile- and web- based toolkit, SUDCare, for primary care patients who are at risk for SUD. SUDCare will be designed to comprehensively support SUD prevention and treatment following an empirically-based protocol through an enhanced remote screening tool and novel chatbot that delivers follow-up care tailored to the patient’s SUD risk level.",SUDCare: A smart mobile tool to support substance use screening and follow-up care,9897003,R43DA050218,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Assessment tool', 'Blinded', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'English Language', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Administration', 'Series', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care providers', 'chatbot', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mobile application', 'model design', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'primary care setting', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'reduced substance use', 'referral services', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'screening and brief intervention', 'screening, brief intervention, referral, and treatment', 'standard care', 'statistics', 'substance use prevention', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'trend', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'virtual']",NIDA,"DIMAGI, INC.",R43,2020,229810,0.009195839470744285
"Improving Quality of Electronic Health Record Ophthalmic Data for Big Data Analytics PROJECT SUMMARY The widespread adoption of EHRs has enabled the collection of massive amounts of digital ophthalmic data which have great potential for secondary use in research, quality improvement, and clinical decision support. While the amount of digital ophthalmic data recorded in the EHR is substantial and could be analyzed using the latest techniques for big data, questions about the quality of the data are a barrier to its reuse. Now that the American Academy of Ophthalmology has aggregated digital ophthalmic data from the EHR into the IRIS Registry, data quality is even more imperative for reaching the potential of the registry. To date, there has not be a comprehensive evaluation of the data quality of digital ophthalmic data, nor have there been any solutions for improving its quality. These are important gaps that will limit the utility of EHR data as a tool for knowledge discovery in ophthalmology. The goal of this grant is to assess the quality of digital ophthalmic exam data in order to improve its ability to be reused for research. Our hypothesis is that studying the variability of data quality in large datasets will provide insights into improving its quality. The first aim employs an established framework for data quality analysis to assess the intrinsic quality of a single institution’s EHR data as well as its fitness for use--the ability to be applied to a particular research scenario. In this proposal, we are evaluating the data’s ability to identify patient cohorts for clinical trials and to accurately calculate outcome based clinical quality measures. The variability in data’s quality and fitness among providers, subspecialties, diagnoses, and visit types will be analyzed. The second aim validates the analysis of the first aim by repeating it for all of the ophthalmic data in the IRIS Registry. For this analysis, the differences in quality and fitness between institutions and EHR vendors will also be assessed, along with the barriers to data quality and reuse. For both aims, ophthalmology experts will review the results to make recommendations for improving data quality and utility for digital ophthalmic data. In the future, these recommendations will provide a direction for correcting these quality issues and for ultimately advancing knowledge discovery in ophthalmic care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electronic health records (EHRs) have not yet reached their potential for transforming healthcare, particularly for reusing clinical data for research. The American Academy of Ophthalmology has aggregated ophthalmic data from the EHR into the IRIS Registry, and data quality is even more imperative to achieve to reach the potential of this registry. Using methodological data quality analysis, we will analyze the quality of a single institution’s ophthalmic data and again for multiple institutions’ ophthalmic data in the IRIS Registry, documenting barriers for data quality and reuse that will lead to improving knowledge discovery from this data.",Improving Quality of Electronic Health Record Ophthalmic Data for Big Data Analytics,9953684,R21EY031443,"['Academy', 'Adoption', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Exfoliation Syndrome', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Iris', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Ophthalmology', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Secondary to', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'cohort', 'data framework', 'data harmonization', 'data quality', 'data registry', 'data reuse', 'data submission', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'research study', 'tool', 'treatment comparison']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,231000,0.0004107448734415167
"SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea  The ability to rapidly match the right patients to the right treatments at the right time is critical to ensuring patients  receive high quality care. The vast majority of machine learning applications in healthcare focus on diagnosing or  stratifying patients for a particular outcome. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn how clinical states  (i.e., sets of signs, symptoms, and test results) respond to specific sequences of treatments, with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes. RL does not aim to diagnose, but infers diagnosis based on a patient's response to  specific treatments--in many ways mimicking how clinicians operate in practice. This proposal will develop a novel  clinician-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) framework that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) clinical time-series data to support physician decision making, iteratively providing physicians the estimated outcome of  potential treatment strategies. Our topic of focus for this work is the evaluation and treatment of patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) and signs of impending respiratory failure. Acute dyspnea is an ideal condition for an RL approach, since it can be due to three overlapping conditions: congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Determining optimal treatment for these patients is clinically difficult, as a patient's presentation is frequently ambiguous, rapidly changing, and often due to multiple causes.  Inappropriate treatment may occur in up to a third of patients leading to increased mortality. While developing this  RL framework, we will also develop methods to learn more useful representations of high-dimensional clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training. In addition, given the challenges of working with observational health data, we will develop new methods for evaluation of learned policies and develop new theory to better understand the limitations of RL using observational data. The project has four aims: 1) create a shareable, de-identified EHR time-series dataset of 35,000 patients with acute dyspnea, 2) develop techniques for exploiting invariances In tasks involving clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training, 3) develop and evaluate an RL-based framework for learning optimal treatment policies for acute dyspnea, and 4) prospectively validate the learned treatment model. This research will result in new techniques for learning representations from time-series data and will study both the theoretical and practical limitations of RL using observational clinical data, leading to key advancements in ML and RL for clinical care. The tools developed for clinical decision support in this proposal have the potential for high impact because of their ability to generalize beyond the problem studied here to other conditions, laying the groundwork for clinical systems that directly impact society by aiding in the timely and appropriate treatment of patients. Hospitalization for sudden and severe shortness of breath (acute dyspnea) affects almost 2 million patients in the US each  year. Such patients can be difficult to treat, as their presentation may ambiguous, due to multiple causes that change over  time and require different types of therapies/treatments. In this proposal, we will develop novel reinforcement-learning  based approaches to quickly match patients to the best treatment based on his/her symptoms over time. The proposed  work could have a significant impact on health by shortening lhe time to appropriate treatments, leading to improved  patient outcomes.",SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea ,10015336,R01LM013325,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Blood Pressure', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morality', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pneumonia', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Rewards', 'Right to Treatments', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Series', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Societies', 'Stream', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'prospective', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,235205,0.009980699983950226
"Sarcopenia: computable phenotypes and clinical outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY  Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function. Sarcopenia contributes to disability, increased hospitalizations, healthcare costs, and risk of death. Despite being under- recognized clinically, sarcopenia is a major public health concern, with the worldwide prevalence projected to increase by up to 72% in the next 30 years. However, limited knowledge of sarcopenia among clinicians, combined with time pressures in clinical encounters delay its detection, and limit opportunity for intervention or recruitment into clinical trials. To overcome this barrier to detecting sarcopenia, we propose to use advanced big data and machine learning methods to identify additional component variables predicting sarcopenia among the rich electronic health record (EHR) data and develop a validated and portable sarcopenia computable phenotype (which uses a computer algorithm to detect patient characteristics or outcomes from the EHR). This innovative proposal takes advantage of key resources at Indiana University and its affiliation with the Regenstrief Institute and the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), a statewide multi-health system clinical data warehouse including >100 healthcare entities and >18 million unique patients with both coded and text-based data, combined with the ability to perform comprehensive musculoskeletal measurements in the Musculoskeletal Function Imaging and Tissue (MSK-FIT) Core funded through a NIAMS Core Center for Clinical Research grant (P30AR072581). Our long-term goal is to accurately identify patients with, or at risk for, sarcopenia and its consequences in order to provide targeted interventions. We hypothesize that by using medical informatics and machine learning innovations, computable phenotypes can identify patients with sarcopenia from the EHR, predict deficits in measured muscle strength and physical function, and prospectively predict risk of hospitalization and death. In Aim 1, we will categorize >2000 adult participants in the MSK-FIT Core with accessible EHR data, as either sarcopenic or nonsarcopenic according to measurements of muscle strength, muscle mass and physical performance. We will then use 75% of the MSK- FIT Core cohort to train machine deep learning algorithms to detect combinations of variables from these subjects’ EHR predicting whether the patient is sarcopenic or not sarcopenic. The performance of the resulting computable phenotype will then be tested in the remaining 25% of the MSK-FIT Core participants. In Aim 2, we will test the performance of the sarcopenia computable phenotype to detect a clinically meaningful phenotype in the entire INPC adult population (>18 million), by evaluating the ability to predict the rate of hospitalizations and death among patients rated as sarcopenic versus matched controls. Such a computable phenotype will then enable large scale targeted recruitment, pragmatic clinical trials, clinical evaluation and intervention.

"Innovative technologies for active surveillance of older adults with low-risk skin cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the number one cancer diagnosed in the US each year and accounts for more cases than all other cancers combined.1,2 Most BCCs are not dangerous, as they typically grow slowly and rarely metastasize or affect quality of life. Because cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun is a major cause of these lesions, BCCs are considered a non-lethal disease of aging, with the vast majority occurring in people 65 years or older. Despite the low risk BCCs present to patients, in the US all lesions are usually treated. Though existing treatments are effective,3,4 post treatment complications are common; in one prospective cohort study 27% of patients reported a problem after a procedure.5 Moreover, over 100,000 BCCs are treated annually in persons who ultimately die within one year of unrelated causes.6 For patients near the end of life, who often manage multiple health issues, treating these lesions may expose them to the associated medical risks with little potential benefit.7  There is a pressing need to reduce over-treatment and instead develop safe and effective active surveillance methods for low risk BCC in older patients. This research aims to fundamentally change the current “one size fits all” standard of care for treatment of BCCs, which is particularly problematic for older adults.6,8,9 The goal of this application is to develop a mobile app for safe, home-based active surveillance of low risk basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). We hypothesize that home-based active surveillance of low risk BCCs would reduce unnecessary procedures, complications and burdensome clinic visits in patients whose BCCs are not changing, while ensuring that patients whose BCCs grow or become symptomatic receive prompt care. For the first step of the proposed research, we will refine an existing artificial intelligence algorithm and mobile app to optimize it for at-home active surveillence use for older adults with low-risk BCC. We will then conduct pre-testing with a small group of patients and caregivers (n=15) to iteratively improve the app and ensure usability. Finally, we will compare the data collected via the app to that collected during routine clinical visits. Over a 9-month period, we will follow participants (n=30) with low-risk BCC who have selected an active surveillance option. We will collect data monthly through the app, and every 3 months through in-person clinic visits. We will evaluate patient satisfaction and clinical course to determine the feasibility of using a mobile app for active surveillance of low-risk BCC. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this application is to develop a mobile app for safe, home-based active surveillance of low-risk basal cell carcinomas (BCCs).

"Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities In the United States (US), an estimated 20 million adults have been diagnosed with substance use disorder (SUD). A major challenge for patients is to identify the most appropriate treatment with the best outcomes. Patients receive care in outpatient and inpatient facilities yet quality metrics at the level of these individual facilities are not publicly available.  In the era of digital data, the Internet and peer-to-peer resources are often the first place where individuals look to find information about healthcare resources. Online reviews on sites like Google and Yelp provide narratives about healthcare facilities and assign easily interpretable star ratings ranging from one to five stars. These reviews of healthcare facilities provide information about patient experience, structure (e.g. physical education) facility, organizational characteristics, payment methods), process (e.g. diagnosis, treatment, patient and outcomes (e.g. knowledge, health-related quality of life morbidity, mortality).  Prior work has demonstrated that online ratings of hospitals correlate with ratings from the national Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Little work however has evaluated the utility of unvalidated, spontaneously generated, but widely accessible online reviews of SUD treatment facilities. These reviews could fill a niche with providing patients and their family members with useful information about the questions and experiences that are most important to them. Or these reviews could be limited and provide misinformation or only biased perspectives. To date, less is known about the potential value or usefulness of this emerging data source.  For this proposal we aim to study online reviews of SUD treatment facilities in the US to identify the areas of care that are reported as most important to patients and family members. For Aim 1, we will first extract approximately 50,000 online reviews of SUD treatment facilities and code them for themes using qualitative methodologies that involve manual coding and big data analytics using machine learning and natural language processing. We hypothesize that these online narratives will include qualitative data about patient experience and the type and quality of care (e.g. evidence-based treatments) provided at SUD treatment facilities. For Aim 2, we will then assess how star ratings differentiate facilities relative to structure and process measures reported in the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services.  Overall, emerging online data resources have the potential to provide new information about a critically vulnerable population affected by the opioid and more broadly the SUD crisis. Our project seeks to rigorously study these new patient-centric data sources viewed by millions of individuals for the purposes of better understanding the needs of patients and family members. These efforts can lay the groundwork for future work in developing measures of quality for a critically important healthcare resource, SUD treatment facilities. Narrative We aim to evaluate narratives and star ratings from online reviews to assess how this consumer generated, data can inform our understanding of care delivery for substance use disorder (SUD). Identifying the themes and measures of quality revealed in these reviews and how they relate to traditional measures of quality could inform future development of patient centric performance measures and ratings for SUD treatment facilities.",Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities,9956035,R21DA050761,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Addiction', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physical Education', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'data resource', 'digital', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mortality', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'payment', 'peer', 'satisfaction', 'substance abuse treatment', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'urgent care', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2020,243000,0.006328559603308708
"Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures,10107959,R00MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'polygenic risk score', 'predictive signature', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R00,2020,248800,-0.015979898572939785
"Point-of-Care CT Perfusion (PoC CT-P) for Early Stroke Assessment Abstract The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a portable and affordable cranial x-ray-based Computed Tomography Perfusion (CT-P) device for expedited front-line evaluation and triage of ischemic cerebral stroke victims. CT-P is the gold standard modality for assessment and classifying stroke patients to determine the best candidates for revascularizing procedures; however, CT-P is generally unavailable early in the current acute care treatment model. Unlike existing conventional CT-P equipment which is generally large, expensive, and stationary, the proposed device would be compact, portable, and affordable to be deployed in nursing homes, urgent care centers, hospital ER triage areas, ICUs, and EMS response vehicles, yet also provide sufficient time and contrast resolution for reliable perfusion metrics. Rapidly acquired point-of-care CT and CT-P images showing blood flow, volume, and transit times will enable (1) early classification of hemorrhage or ischemic, and (2) assessment of the recoverable brain tissue volume. This will enable early screening evaluation for appropriate acute stroke patient prioritization and routing. In addition, it may also provide an economical and safe bedside means of assessing cranial perfusion for follow up care in the ICU, recovery room, or even eventually in a residential care setting. Xoran Technologies LLC specializes in point-of-care (POC) medical imaging and has successfully marketed over 750 POC imaging devices in the US. Project Narrative When an individual is suffering from acute stroke, time is of the essence; however, it is critically important to assess the type of stroke as well as the amount and location of potentially recoverable brain tissue to determine the appropriate routing and priority to achieve the best outcome for that individual. In this project a new compact and portable device is proposed that allows cranial perfusion studies to be performed earlier in the process than the current standard of care, potentially in a nursing home, urgent care center, or in an emergency vehicle such as an ambulance. Public health is affected both by the potential for improved outcomes for individuals, but also for systemwide cost savings and efficiency gains by not transporting patients who are not likely to benefit from a trip to a level one stroke treatment center.",Point-of-Care CT Perfusion (PoC CT-P) for Early Stroke Assessment,10009036,R43NS117244,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'American Stroke Association', 'Area', 'Blood flow', 'Caliber', 'Caring', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebral Infarction', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cost Savings', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Emergency Situation', 'Equipment', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health care facility', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nursing Homes', 'Ocular orbit', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery Room', 'Residential Treatment', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Route', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Service delivery model', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Teleradiology', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vascularization', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute care', 'acute stroke', 'arm', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical center', 'commercial application', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'disability', 'early screening', 'follow-up', 'functional independence', 'imager', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'phantom model', 'point of care', 'portability', 'product development', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'response', 'rural area', 'standard of care', 'stroke patient', 'stroke symptom', 'stroke therapy', 'stroke victims', 'treatment center', 'urgent care']",NINDS,"XORAN TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2020,249154,0.0005535873181687597
"Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a serious but increasingly treatable cause of heart failure. Autopsy studies have estimated the prevalence of CA at approximately 25% of all octogenarians, and 15 to 20% of patients with aortic stenosis. Despite the increasing prevalence of CA within the general population and specific subpopulations, its diagnosis as a cause of heart failure is hampered by under recognition and subsequent underdiagnosis in clinical practice. Data suggest that the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is 2 years and that patients report seeing an average of 5 physicians prior to establishing a definitive diagnosis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) testing is the most common initial evaluation because of its wide availability. A recent utilization review in the Medicare population indicated over 7 Million echocardiographic tests are performed each year accounting for $1.2 Billion in healthcare costs. TTEs provide comprehensive information about cardiac structure and function, yet complexity of interpretation has limited its screening performance in patients with CA, and diagnosis can be challenging. Thus, our group seeks to offer a computer vision and machine learning based TTE analysis and screening solution for CA. We are uniquely positioned for accelerated development with a cohort of 359 patients with confirmed CA and 4,862 controls. In Phase I, we will build a deep learning neural network-based image processing pipeline. It maps the TTE sequence into a 2-dimensional space that allows for the identification of the 4-chamber peak diastolic and peak systolic images within the cardiac heartbeat cycle. This will enable our screening model to recognize regional myocardial wall motion changes and hypertrophic patterns that characterize amyloidosis in comparison to controls with normal cardiac function. The operational point defining the performance characteristics of our screening-oriented model (including sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value) will be optimized using an average weighted accuracy (AWA) approach which accounts for CA disease prevalence along with a desired false positive and false negative tradeoff. If we are successful, we envision a Phase II proposal to build and deploy an automated TTE analysis tool, and to evaluate it in a multi- center clinical study. This sets the stage for our long-term goal to implement a computer assisted TTE screening solution to improve identification and by extension care of patients with cardiac amyloidosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE While non-invasive echocardiography is a first line tool for diagnosis for many cardiovascular symptoms, it is underutilized for less common diseases such as cardiac amyloidosis which recently has been shown to be increasingly prevalent in general and specific subpopulations. In this project, we will develop and validate a novel computer-assistive echocardiographic analysis tool to recognize the presence of cardiac amyloidosis. It is our hope that this technology will enhance the screening and subsequent diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis, ultimately, leading to improved patient outcomes.",Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis,10081836,R43HL154896,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Awareness', 'Biopsy', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Echocardiography', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Laboratories', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Multi-site clinical study', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial', 'Octogenarian', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Utilization Review', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'case control', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genetic analysis', 'heart function', 'image processing', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'point of care', 'screening', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,"VIGILANT MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2020,249373,-0.013561076736813693
"Multisite Electronic Health Record-Based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults Approximately 3 million young adults aged 18-44 years currently have diabetes in the United States. This number is projected to increase to ~5.8 million by 2060. Differentiating diabetes types is crucial, because the etiology, treatments, and outcomes of diabetes differ substantially by type. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) accounts for ~17% and type 2 diabetes (T2D) ~75% of total diabetes in US young adults. This distribution of diabetes types continuously evolves. We do not have a large-scale surveillance system to monitor the prevalence and incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults. The widespread use and increasing functionality of electronic health record (EHR) systems substantially increase the quantity, breadth, and timeliness of data available for surveillance and reduce costs compared with population-based registries and surveys. EHR algorithms have shown great potential in identifying diabetes cases. This study will analyze both structured EHR data (e.g., diagnosis codes, medications, and laboratory results) and unstructured clinical notes. We will apply expert knowledge, machine learning, and natural language processing to develop the best algorithms for identifying prevalent and incident T1D and T2D cases. The primary objective of this study is to establish an EHR-based surveillance system for monitoring the burden of T1D and T2D in US young adults. We will collaborate with 3 EHR research networks from the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), covering ~6 million racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse young adults from 4 states (IL, LA, NY, and TX) in 3 Census regions. The patient populations in this study are roughly representative of the source populations in the catchment areas. The specific aims of this study are 1) to estimate the prevalence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 2) to estimate the incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 3) to estimate 10-year trends in the prevalence and incidence of T1D and T2D in US young adults by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region, 2014-2023; and 4) to compare the prevalence and incidence of diabetes by type, as well as temporal trends, in US young adults with those in young adults from other countries and regions. This study is innovative, because it will detect a false negative rate as low as 0.2%, leverage EHRs for surveillance (more efficient and cost-effective than registries and surveys), use advanced statistical approaches (e.g., machine learning and natural language processing), estimate a denominator using patient zip codes, build flexibility into the surveillance methods according to local availability of clinical notes, and use a 2-staged sampling approach to improve chart review efficiency. This study will advance our understanding of the age, sex, racial/ethnic, and geographic differences in the burden of T1D and T2D in US young adults. The obtained surveillance data will inform planning for healthcare needs, prioritize the allocation of healthcare resources, and reduce health disparities via identifying and prioritizing subpopulations for prevention of diabetes and related comorbidities. The burden of diabetes has been increasing considerably in recent decades in US young adults. However, there is no large-scale surveillance system for monitoring the burden of diabetes by type in US young adults. This study will build an efficient and cost-effective multisite surveillance system using electronic health records, to estimate the prevalence, incidence, and temporal trends of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in US young adults according to age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region.",Multisite Electronic Health Record-Based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Young Adults,10085448,U18DP006502,[' '],NCCDPHP,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,U18,2020,250000,0.0007732965192352599
"electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS). ABSTRACT Recent meta-analyses have found that participation in the appropriate fall-prevention exercise program for an older adult reduces the risk of falls by 23% in relative terms, for an absolute reduction of 0.20 falls per person per year. Many guidelines, including the US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF), recommend that older adults at risk of falls are referred to appropriate fall-prevention exercise programs (USPSTF Level B). Despite this evidence, many older adults do not receive appropriate referrals and support for fall-prevention exercises, with one study finding that less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). Older people living in rural areas are more likely to fall but are less likely to participate in fall prevention programs. Advances in computing technology can help to identify older people at risk of falls and disseminate guidance about the most effective interventions using clinical decision support (CDS) systems. Patients can be supported in their exercise programs through a patient-focused App distributed through the PCP or through content on their patient portal. Well-implemented CDS that is integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) can support prescribing or recommending effective strategies and engaging patients in fall prevention decision-making thus integrating evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice. The long-term goal of our research program is to enhance the safety of community-based older adults by reducing falls through an effective patient-centered learning health system called eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS). With eSTEPS, an exercise algorithm will be integrated into the EHR which will trigger a Best Practice Alert (BPA) and Smart Set to provide actionable CDS within primary care clinic workflows and facilitate the use of CDS with patients to ensure evidence-based recommendations are tailored to patient preferences. The resulting fall prevention exercise care plan will be sent to the EHR as a note and to a patient-facing App for the patient to view after their visit. In this proposal we will use traditional fall risk screening and machine learning approaches to accurately identify older adults at risk for falls. We will then develop, CDS implemented into the electronic health record that helps primary care providers and older patients develop a tailored fall prevention exercise plan. We will conduct a cluster randomized control trial in urban and rural primary care clinics to test the efficacy of the eSTEPS CDS intervention. Development of the eSTEPS CDS within the widely adopted Epic EHR will support dissemination of evidence for older adults, with a focus on rural elders. NARRATIVE There is substantial evidence that conducting multifactorial fall risk assessments and developing personalized prevention plans in primary care settings can reduce falls, but many barriers exist to integrating this evidence into practice. The US Preventive Service Task Force recommends fall prevention exercises for community- dwelling adults who are at increased risk for falls, however less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). The goal of this project is to develop, test, and evaluate shareable, standards-based fall prevention clinical decision support, eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS) that can used by primary care providers to facilitate personalized activity and exercise prescriptions and reduce falls in at risk older adults.",electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS).,10049339,R61AG068926,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Monitor', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Prevention Guidelines', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Screening procedure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visit', 'base', 'behavior change', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'effective intervention', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'exercise prescription', 'exercise program', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'machine learning method', 'neighborhood safety', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'patient portal', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'rural area', 'screening', 'smartphone Application', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R61,2020,250020,0.011738172477375726
"Wearable Sensors for Biofeedback & Remote Monitoring Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years, and rotator cuff repair is a standard surgical procedure with nearly 500,000 procedures performed annually. In the United States alone the direct costs are over $7 billion per year. There is a relatively high rate of retears: ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a protracted process during which the repaired tendon has to be unloaded by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. There is an inherent conflict in immobilizing the shoulder to protect the repair and mobilizing the shoulder to prevent stiffness. Teaching the patient passive exercises that do not activate contraction of the supraspinatus muscle is challenging and very difficult to monitor. To address this unmet need, we have developed a wearable sensor that provides direct real-time continuous biofeedback of muscle activity, joint angle, skin temperature, and swelling to enable passive shoulder exercises while minimizing muscle contraction. To test and validate this device we propose to the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: Design, manufacture, and test a wearable device with surface EMG (sEMG), inertial measurement unit (IMU), temperature, and bioimpedance sensors. Aim 2: Measure accuracy of Active4D sEMG and IMUs relative to standard clinical measurements. Active4D is a surgeon-driven company devoted to enhancing patient recovery from surgery by leveraging new technology. Active4D’s unique wearable sensor provides continuous long-term sensor augmented biofeedback to patients and enables remote patient monitoring for surgeons. The device measures seven physiologic metrics in real time – muscle activation, joint range of motion, skin temperature, swelling, activity, gait, and fall risk. Real time physiologic data will increase safety, improve outcomes, and enhance patient experience while lowering the cost of rehabilitation and complications. Unique artificial intelligence driven algorithms can decrease complications through predictive analytics which enable early detection and intervention for high risk patients.  The specific innovation to the application of rotator cuff repair, is the instantaneous feedback of muscle activity and motion which can accelerate recovery while reducing the risk of retears. At the successful completion of Phase I, we plan to launch a clinical trial comparing the outcomes of rotator cuff repair in patients guided by the A4D device in comparison to the current standard of postoperative rehabilitation.  Active4D is a small business with the objective of developing smart wearables, which integrate multiple biological and environmental sensors, wireless communication, computer models, and data analysis for providing feedback and remote monitoring, to enhance surgical rehabilitation and improved patient outcomes in orthopaedics. Co-founders Drs. Hoenecke and D’Lima have extensive experience in shoulder surgery and rehabilitation, multi-center clinical trials, and biomechanics research; and have successfully executed challenging projects such as implantation of innovative electronic knee designs and development of new shoulder implants. Dr. Hoenecke has over 30 years of experience in the practice of sports medicine with an emphasis on shoulder repair and reconstruction. He provides care for elite athletes and is design surgeon for two shoulder implants. Active4D has partnered with expert physical therapists and orthopedists to develop and test our innovative technology. Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years. Despite the popularity of surgical repair, the rate of retears is high: ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a lengthy process during which the repaired tendon has to be unloading by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. This Phase I SBIR will develop an innovative wearable device with the potential to facilitate safe exercises, alert the patient during activities at risk for retears, and accelerate recovery while reducing the risk for retears. The device can also remotely monitor progress of the patient over the postoperative period and can modulate the feedback appropriate to the phase of recovery.",Wearable Sensors for Biofeedback & Remote Monitoring,10156598,R43AR078082,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biofeedback', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Direct Costs', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Immobilization', 'Implant', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Older Population', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Series', 'Shoulder', 'Skin Temperature', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Sports Medicine', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Swelling', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'United States', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'healing', 'high risk', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'miniaturize', 'new technology', 'physical therapist', 'post-operative rehabilitation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'repaired', 'rotator cuff tear', 'sensor', 'success', 'supraspinatus muscle', 'trial comparing', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'wireless communication']",NIAMS,"ACTIVE4D, INC.",R43,2020,250998,0.012537388750531593
"Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The National Institute of Health report Diabetes in America (2018) noted that 39.5% of adults with diabetes are aged ≥ 65 years, and the prevalence of diabetes in older adults is dramatically increasing. Management of diabetes in older adults in nursing homes is challenging due to this population having heterogeneous comorbid medical conditions, and associated medications, many of which are contraindicated for common antidiabetic drugs. Intensive diabetes management in older adults is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Drug induced hypoglycemia is the 3rd most common adverse drug event among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries. Hypoglycemia is experienced by 18% to 40% of nursing home residents. There is a lack of observational or clinical evidence pertaining to antidiabetic treatments in long-term care nursing home residents, despite this population being at high risk for diabetes, diabetes-related complications, and adverse effects of antidiabetic drugs. The American Diabetes Association’s consensus report on diabetes in older adults noted that “There are essentially no directly applicable clinical trial data on glucose control for large segments of the older diabetic patient population.” Furthermore, there are few real-world studies of antidiabetic treatments in nursing home residents. In recognition of this knowledge gap in this high-risk population, the Diabetes Mellitus Interagency Coordinating Committee, as reported in the NIDDK Recent Advances & Emerging Opportunities (2019), issued a call for studies that increase our understanding of diabetes treatments in long-term care settings, with a particular emphasis on the need to understand the impact of cognitive and functional impairments, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and risk of hypoglycemia. These priorities are central to our proposed scope of research. Using the Federally-mandated Minimum Data Set 3.0, linked to Medicare Part A and D claims, the aims are to: 1) characterize antidiabetic treatment practices among nursing home residents; 2) identify and describe clinically relevant phenotypes of diabetic nursing home residents based on patterns of cognitive/functional impairments, comorbidities, and treatment procedures/medications, and 3) estimate the occurrence of hospitalizations (overall, hypoglycemia-related, and hypoglycemia-specific) by propensity- matched patterns of antidiabetic treatments, across resident phenotypes. We hypothesize that risks associated with antidiabetic treatments will be heterogeneous across resident phenotypes. We anticipate that the phenotypic approach we propose will serve as a foundation for future work to conduct phenotypic-specific comparative effectiveness research in support of evidence-based personalized antidiabetic treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nursing home residents have a high prevalence of diabetes and high risks of diabetes complications. There is limited observational or clinical evidence supporting antidiabetic treatment decisions in long-term care nursing home residents. This study will examine the use and safety of antidiabetic treatments across subgroups (phenotypes) of older nursing home residents with diabetes.",Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents,9957331,R21NR019160,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Age Distribution', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Americas', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Coin', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care Nursing', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medication Management', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse event risk', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'diabetes management', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'human old age (65+)', 'instrument', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'patient population', 'person centered', 'personalized medicine', 'trend', 'virtual']",NINR,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R21,2020,251250,-0.03417357982593711
"Survive-OUD: AI Platform to Integrate Complex Data Sources, Predict Relapse, and Recommend Interventions for Opioid Use Disorder The current opioid crisis is significantly impacting millions of lives, healthcare, social welfare, and the economy. Patient interactions with the treatment system coupled with results of completed studies create a wealth of data stored in disparate electronic sources. Therapists and health care providers with limited time and resources face challenges to access, integrate and monitor this vast data set for novel opportunities to improve care. Significant advances would include predicting when a patient will relapse out of a program, and also suggesting optimal personalized care strategies to reengage patients before this negative event occurs.  Survive-OUD will solve these challenges by providing a web-based therapist interface integrating survivor model artificial intelligence (AI) strategies. Based on multiple input data domains leveraged from existing electronic medical record sources, survivor recurrent neural networks will be trained to recognize when patients are likely to relapse or drop out of an OUD program. Examples of data domains that can be input to the network include patient demographics, medical and prescription data, engagement with therapy paradigms, and compliance with logistical program tasks. Furthermore, once a patient is noted as high risk, a second layer of algorithms will be developed to recommend a specific and personalized care strategy for retention based on existing best practices in the literature and clinical trials. Therefore, the Survive-OUD platform will also integrate with common literature database and clinical trial repositories. Utilizing an existing AI platform for searching, tagging, and extracting data from database sources, the innovative platform will close the loop on actionable results by recommending updated care options based on potential outcomes learned from best practices in existing literature. The AI architecture developed will greatly improve success rates in opioid addition programs and expand high quality healthcare.  While the commercialized Survive-OUD platform will integrate all features above, Phase I will target feasibility of data aggregation and AI algorithms to detect relapse and recommend intervention strategies. The innovative technical challenge in Phase I is to develop and validate targeted AI tools using data already being captured in patient workflow to allow early prediction of patient retention issues. More specifically, a prototype therapist interface and data network infrastructure will be developed to source personalized patient data as well as literature and clinical trial sources. Once the platform architecture has passed verification testing, it will be deployed in a field data collection study to determine usability and also provide a rich set of de-identified data for algorithm development. Collected data will then be used to train and test AI algorithms for early detection of patient dropout/relapse and appropriate treatment recommendation. The objective is to design, develop, and demonstrate feasibility of Survive-OUD, an artificial intelligence driven platform to integrate complex data sources, predict patient relapse, and recommend intervention strategies for individuals impacted by opioid use disorder. Currently millions of Americans suffer from an opioid use disorder (OUD) and program relapse rates are extremely high. Therefore, an advanced, bioinformatics platform that accurately predicts when OUD patients will drop out of programs and offers personalized prevention strategies would provide a novel clinical tool to help combat the opioid crisis in the U.S.","Survive-OUD: AI Platform to Integrate Complex Data Sources, Predict Relapse, and Recommend Interventions for Opioid Use Disorder",10133357,R43DA052916,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Burden', 'Event', 'Face', 'Fentanyl', 'Foundations', 'Geography', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Heroin', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Online Systems', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Patient Dropouts', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Price', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Service delivery model', 'Social Welfare', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Update', 'Variant', 'algorithm development', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'combat', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'data de-identification', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health care quality', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'patient population', 'personalized care', 'personalized strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'programs', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'repository', 'retention rate', 'socioeconomics', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDA,"INSILICA, LLC",R43,2020,251348,0.007924297341434077
"SCH: ChangeGradients: Promoting Adolescent Health Behavior Change with Clinically Integrated Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient Methods Because the majority of adolescent health problems are amenable to behavioral intervention and most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, hea lth behavior change interventions linked to clinic- based health information technologies hold significant promise for improving healthcare quality and subsequent behavioral health outcomes for adolescents. Recognizing the potential to leverage advances in machine learning and virtual narrative environments, the field of health behavior change is now well- positioned to design health behavior change systems that extend the reach of clinicians to realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on alcohol use, the project has two specific aims: (1) design, develop, and iteratively refine a policy-based reinforcement learning behavior change system for preventive adolescent health, and (2) investigate the impact of a clinically integrated sample-efficient policy gradient-based behavior change system on adolescent behavior. The project w ill culminate w ith an investigation of the behavioral effects of the CHANGEGRADIENTS system using adolescent patients recruited from two outpatient primary care clinics within the UCSF Department of Pediatrics: Mt. Zion Pediatrics and the Adolescent/Young Adult Clinic. It is hypothesized that adolescents who interact with CHANGEGRADIENTS with reduce number of days of alcohol use, reduce binge drinking, and increase self-efficacy to engage in healthy behavior a nd avoid risky substance use. It is anticipated that CHANGEGRADIENTS will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change that is designed to be tightly integrated into clinical practice workflow. By taking advantage of the high degree of adaptive interactivity offered by its personalized behavior change environment, CHANGEGRADIENTS holds significant potential for creating compelling interactions that promote self-efficacy and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to prevent cancer through improving cancer-related behaviors and risk factors.  REL EVAN CE (Se e in stru cti ons): The proposed research will develop and field test an innovative computationally-enabled personalized behavior change model that will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and is designed to be integrated into clinical practice.

"Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in the aging population and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, including cerebrovascular injury. Repetitive exposure to acute CV response, such as sympathetic surge and blood pressure (BP) rise following obstructive respiratory events, is an important mediating mechanism linking OSA to CV disease and cerebrovascular injury. However, such acute CV responses are not effectively captured by conventional polysomnography metrics, such as the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) commonly used in OSA evaluation. This results in imprecise classification of patients in terms of their CV risk and may be responsible for inconsistent results in epidemiologic and clinical studies. More importantly, the uncertainty of the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in reducing the CV risk poses a significant challenge in therapeutic decision-making in older individuals. Therefore, the identification of additional phenotypic markers that better quantify the unfavorable CV effects of OSA and provide improved prediction of CV outcomes is crucial to improving risk stratification and clinical therapeutic decision-making. Herein, we propose to study novel physiologic measurements that can readily be retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether PPG features are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CV disease, and cerebrovascular injury. We will extract PPG features from polysomnography obtained in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study and examine whether PPG features are associated with CV outcomes, including left ventricular mass, aortic stiffness, and incident cardiovascular events, as well as markers of cerebrovascular injury, including brain structural abnormalities by MRI and cognitive impairment by Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument in the older men and women. We will compare the association of PPG features with these outcomes with that of conventional OSA assessment metrics (such as apnea hypopnea index). The main PPG feature of interest is slope transit time. To assess the utility of the various PPG features for use in estimating and classifying outcomes, we will use novel machine learning methods, such as are based on the GNOSIS (Generalized Networks for the Optimal Synthesis of Information Systems) information-theory-based modeling tool. Subsequently, we will determine how PPG features predict BP treatment response to CPAP and O2 therapy using data from the HeartBEAT randomized controlled trial. This study attempts to identify novel PSG metrics that are cardiovascular-centric and to assess their clinical utility in the older adults. The findings of the study will provide a basis for further development of a simpler method by which to assess and monitor OSA. Considering the high prevalence of OSA in older populations, coupled with its impact on adverse health outcomes, the proposal has significant public health implications. Project Narrative Currently used conventional metrics for sleep apnea assessment has many limitations including insufficient consideration of acute cardiovascular response to sleep apnea event. We propose to study a novel physiologic measurements that can be readily retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether they are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CVD and neurocognitive outcomes. We will use data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study to evaluate PPG features in their associations with outcomes and examine whether these features help identify people who respond better to CPAP therapy in terms of blood pressure in the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) randomized controlled trial data.",Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep,10107688,R21AG070576,"['Acute', 'Apnea', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Heart', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Left Ventricular Mass', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Older Population', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Polysomnography', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'aging population', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'older men', 'older women', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2020,256550,0.0051915605241621456
"Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11% of older adults in the United States. Studies on patient transitions across healthcare settings suggests that older adults with chronic conditions are vulnerable to inadequate transfer of information, putting them at risk for diminished quality of care, medication errors and potentially preventable complications. Patients at varied stages along the ADRD trajectory – especially those with multiple chronic conditions – may experience unique risks due to the loss of information across care settings. In a recent study, we developed a longitudinal dataset on a diverse cohort of 56,652 patients – mostly aged 65+ with multiple comorbidities – receiving home health care (HHC) services from a large non-profit home care provider. For patients admitted to HHC in 2010-2012, we identified subgroups of patients with ADRD diagnoses made prior to and after HHC admission. Outside the scope of this prior study remains a vast and largely unexplored data source – nurses’ free-text clinical notes captured in the electronic health record. With roughly 1 million entries of nurses’ free- text notes associated with the study population, there is a wealth of potential information from which to gain new insights and a need for innovative methods to analyze this unstructured data source. In this study, we propose to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, a method for systematically analyzing free-text content that draws upon machine learning. Using the dataset developed in the prior study, this study aims to: 1. Expand and improve an existing NLP system to automatically identify the following information in the  nursing free-text notes: (i) knowledge of the patient having a previously established ADRD diagnosis; (ii)  observations of cognitive symptoms and related patient/caregiver needs; and (iii) mentions of interventions  to address these needs. 2. For patients who do not have an ADRD diagnosis prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-  text documentation of cognitive symptoms identified in the NLP predict subsequent ADRD diagnoses  during the 4-year follow-up period. 3. Among patients diagnosed with ADRD prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-text  documentation patterns (e.g. knowledge of the patient’s ADRD diagnostic status, observations of cognitive  symptoms, and interventions) predict: (i) service use; and (ii) adverse health outcomes for which ADRD  patients are at heightened risk (e.g. hospitalizations due to urinary tract infection, dehydration, falls). This study will allow us to examine HHC nurses’ practices, which are often difficult to observe systematically, and identify strategies to address the complex needs of their patients with ADRD and un-diagnosed patients who may be on a path toward ADRD diagnosis. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a home- based intervention that aims to improve quality of life for patients and caregivers along the ADRD trajectory. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect about 5 million people in the U.S. Home health care nurses provide care for many people with ADRD and document what they observe about their patients’ needs in the form of free-text notes. This study will use a method known as ‘natural language processing’ to gain new knowledge from nurses’ notes and identify ways to better support people with ADRD and their caregivers.","Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study",10056750,R21AG065753,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Assessment tool', 'Awareness', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Nursing', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dehydration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home Care Services', 'Home Health Care Agencies', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicare claim', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'New York', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Services', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Management', 'Services', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Visiting Nurse', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'health care settings', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'patient home care', 'patient subsets', 'racial and ethnic', 'study population', 'unstructured data']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,R21,2020,260660,0.008298287237676782
"Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival  Chronic kidney disease affects about 10% of adults in the United States and 7-12% of the population worldwide. It may lead to irreversible loss of kidney function, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment compared to dialysis in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. Despite the advantages of kidney transplants, most patients with ESRD are treated with dialysis primarily because there exist an insufficient number of compatible donors for patients. The human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the organ donor and recipient are known to be a significant contributing factor to transplanted organ survival times due to immunogenicity, the immune response of the recipient to the transplanted organ. Mismatches between donor and recipient HLAs are associated with shorter survival times; however, it is extremely rare to identify donors that have a perfect match with recipients, so most transplants involve mismatched HLAs. Our main objective is to accurately predict survival times for kidney transplants by incorporating both data- driven models of HLA compatibility based on outcomes of past transplants and biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve patient transplant outcomes by enabling more efficient allocation of donors and recipients, particularly by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a poorly matched donor. We propose to estimate HLA compatibilities using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to outcomes of past transplants and through a novel donor-recipient latent space model for the HLA compatibility network. We then propose to incorporate these predicted compatibilities along with biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity using amino acid sequences and epitopes into a multi-task classification-based survival prediction algorithm. Our proposed approach for learning integrated data- and biologically-driven models of transplant survival generalizes broadly to organ transplantation (liver, heart, pancreas, lungs) and possibly to bone marrow transplantation. Finding better methods for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient may redefine and improve clinical outcomes for organ and tissue transplants. In fact, new approach may revolutionize the selection of donors with recipients, thereby producing significantly improved long-term organ and tissue transplant survivals.",Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival ,9985180,R01LM013311,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens', 'Anus', 'Biological', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Donor Selection', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epitopes', 'HLA Antigens', 'Heart', 'Immune response', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Survival', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Science', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'base', 'cost', 'discrete time', 'graft failure', 'hazard', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'learning network', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'survival prediction', 'transplant model', 'treatment comparison']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO,R01,2020,277764,-0.008455208283077735
"Improving Ethical Care for Patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS) Most Americans do not have advance directives or appointed surrogates to guide their medical care in the event that they lose the capacity to make decisions for themselves. Healthcare teams are sometimes able to identify “default” surrogates, i.e., family or friends who can provide information about the patient's values, goals, preferences, and beliefs. However, a growing number of patients become decisionally incapacitated without any advance directives, appointed surrogates, or default surrogates, which leaves them vulnerable to receiving care that is unaligned with these tenets. Currently there is almost no data describing the prevalence of patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS) or how clinical decisions are made for them. The proposed study will address this gap with two specific aims.  In Aim 1 we will determine (1a) what are the prevalence and characteristics of adults who are INEADS or at risk of becoming INEADS, and (1b) how clinical decisions are currently made for patients who are INEADS. For this aim we will retrospectively review electronic health records from an acute care database of ~40,000 hospitalizations and a home healthcare care database of ~89,000 community dwelling patients using a combination of structured data, natural language processing, and content analysis to answer the following questions: (i) What is the prevalence of patients who are currently INEADS and at risk of becoming INEADS in acute care and homecare settings; (ii) Who are the hospital and community personnel and policies involved, (iii) How do patient characteristics and diagnoses influence decisions, and (iv) What is the timeline for making decisions and how expeditiously are decisions reached?  In Aim 2 we will qualitatively explore the phenomenon of INEADS from clinical and patient perspectives. For this aim we will conduct: (1) focus groups with hospital- and community-based healthcare providers and hospital ethics boards, and (2) interviews with community-dwelling patients at risk of becoming INEADS. Sample questions to be explored include (i) What are the barriers and facilitators to formalizing and standardizing the clinical decision-making process for INEADS patients, and (ii) What are the barriers and facilitators to completing advance directives and designating surrogate decision makers among patients at risk of becoming INEADS?  The long-term goal of this project is to provide vulnerable INEADS patients with ethical care that is concordant with their goals and preferences. Knowledge gained from this pilot will inform (1) an intervention study to increase advance directive completion and surrogate designation among patients at risk of becoming INEADS, (2) the development, implementation, and evaluation of formalized decision-making processes for INEADS patients, and (3) the design, delivery, and testing of clinician education on best practices for caring for INEADS patients and patients at risk of becoming INEADS. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The majority of Americans do not have advance directives or healthcare proxies, and more adults are living independently without the support of family or friends. As a result, patients who lose the ability to make healthcare decisions for themselves may not have any voice in deciding what types of treatments they will receive. This study will investigate (1) how many patients in the hospital and community have no advance directives, surrogate decision makers, or ability to make decisions for themselves, and (2) how clinical teams make decisions for these patients.",Improving Ethical Care for Patients who are Incapacitated with No Evident Advance Directives or Surrogates (INEADS),10038963,R21NR019319,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'Advocate', 'American', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Bioethics', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospital Ethics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Independent Living', 'Institutional Policy', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Team', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Update', 'Voice', 'Work', 'acute care', 'base', 'care preference', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'court', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'family support', 'high risk', 'improved', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prevent', 'programs', 'social', 'structured data', 'surrogate decision maker']",NINR,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2020,284481,0.020310123606438982

"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",10019455,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2020,290216,0.000563783294556407
"Wound management through quantitative documentation and prediction Project Summary:  We propose in this SBIR effort to develop a mobile health software system for clinicians to conveniently and/or remotely manage and quantitatively document the healing process of chronic ulcers such as diabetic foot ulcers. Timely, frequent, and accurate documentation on wound appearance and dimension is vital for the growth assessment and tracking of treatment effectiveness. However, current practice is subjective, inconsistent, and even invasive. The absence of easily accessible, repeatable, and quantitative data affects care coordination among the medical staffs and handicaps the best treatment planning for individual patients. For chronic wound sufferers, countless routine visits and the ever increasing high treatment costs also hinders their chance of timely treatment and urgently calls for a convenient alternative.  Built on a seamlessly integrated client-server framework, the proposed management software allows clinicians to easily exchange wound data with the cloud server, analyze the wound healing information, and manage patient's treatment. Together with potentially other wound sensor data, our software system offers objective and quantitative assessment on wound tissue healing status, avoiding misinterpretation or inconsistent grading among medical staffers. With large patient data to be collected, the proposed software is perceived to assist clinicians with evidence based healing prediction and more effective personalized treatment planning.  Every year, approximately 6.5 million Americans suffer from chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and venous stasis ulcers. The number is projected to grow rapidly due to the aging baby boomer population and a sharp rise in diabetes and obesity. Chronic wound healing is a lengthy process with months or even years of treatment time. Absence of personalized attention could easily cause infections and complications, leading to loss of limb. Evidence suggests that 80% of amputations are actually preventable through access of good quality and routine care. With the ever increasing high healthcare costs and the likelihood of early discharge to home care, patients are highly vulnerable to complications due to the lack of routine checkup or personalized care. All of these validates the urgent need of an alternative, convenient, and low cost clinical practice as what our mobile health app is able to provide. Project Narrative  The proposed mobile health software system to be developed under this SBIR project will provide clinicians a convenient yet comprehensive diagnosis and treatment tool, empowering them to provide personalized and timely care for chronic ulcer sufferers. With its unique client-server framework and many advantages over existing standard of care, the proposed management system will have a reasonably large market share in this rapidly growing multi-billion dollar industry. Lastly, the proprietary mobile health technology can be used for the treatment of other type of wounds and diseases such as burns, acute wounds, battle wounds, and endoscopic diseases.",Wound management through quantitative documentation and prediction,10081799,R44AG067799,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Burn injury', 'Chronic Care', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Elderly', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Technology', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Information Management', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Limb structure', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Staff', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Monitor', 'Necrosis', 'Obesity', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stasis Ulcer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'Visit', 'Visual Perception', 'Wound models', 'acute wound', 'augmented intelligence', 'baby boomer', 'base', 'care coordination', 'checkup examination', 'chronic ulcer', 'chronic wound', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data management', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'diabetic', 'digital', 'dimensional analysis', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'healing', 'individual patient', 'mHealth', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'phase 1 designs', 'programs', 'routine care', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'trend', 'wound', 'wound care', 'wound healing', 'wound treatment']",NIA,"XYKEN, LLC",R44,2020,298277,-0.04455782443155361
"Development of a Novel Diagnostic Test for Pulmonary Embolism Based on Artificial Intelligence and Spectral Analysis of Blood Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects adults of all ages yet can present with a myriad of symptoms, ranging from chest pain to shortness of breath, syncope, or seizure. Currently, physicians can assess for this condition with a blood test (D-dimer) which has high sensitivity but very poor specificity, thus resulting in a larger number of false positives. Alternatively, or in the case of a positive D-dimer, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan can be used, both of which are expensive and expose the patient to a significant amount of ionizing radiation. To develop a more specific blood test for PE, Biocogniv will apply state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) to aggregate analysis of existing blood biomarkers measured on two commercially available multiplex immunoassay platforms, one of which is currently used in hospital labs. A sufficiently accurate, rapid and cost-effective test could be broadly applied (i.e., like troponin-I for myocardial infarction) to reduce overuse of CT, simplify ED decision making, and reduce the number of deaths from unrecognized PE. In this proposed Phase I single center study, Biocogniv will collaborate with the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMMC) to demonstrate proof-of-concept for diagnosing PE in emergency department (ED) patients for whom there is sufficient concern for PE to warrant a D-dimer test as part of routine clinical care. Specific Aim I is to collect blood from 225 emergency department (ED) patients at UVMMC who were suspected of having PE (including 75 patients that are confirmed to have PE by CTPA), and analyze the blood plasma with quantitative immunoassays to create training and validation datasets for AI analysis. Immunoassays will be comprised of a set of 6 rapid FDA-cleared chemiluminescent immunoassays performed in parallel, and a 20-plex bead-based immunoassay panel targeting known cardiovascular and inflammatory markers associated with acute PE. Specific Aim II is to develop AI data models for two pretest populations—all D-dimer tested patients and just D-dimer positive patients—for bead-based and point-of-care immunoassay datasets (analyzed separately), then evaluate the performance of each data model on a subset of blood plasma data withheld for validation. As part of the evaluation of AI data model performance, the potential impact of study size on data model accuracy will be simulated by plotting specificity as a function of training sample number to show that adding more samples can improve test results. The performance of each approach (i.e., AI methodology applied to a given immunoassay panel for a given pretest population) will be compared and used to plan a Phase II multi-center study and to identify and attract a suitable instrumentation partner. Biocogniv’s end goal is to develop a rapid, highly specific and sensitive FDA cleared test for PE that will become the standard of care for initial diagnosis and triage of patients with potential pulmonary embolism, disrupting the $2B/year D-Dimer market and improving ED patient care. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially fatal condition that presents with non-specific symptoms (including chest pain, shortness of breath, and fainting) and is notoriously difficult to diagnose: as many as 1 in 3 Emergency Department (ED) patients ultimately diagnosed with PE are initially mis-diagnosed, and up to 1 in 3 PE deaths are only discovered upon autopsy. Biocogniv seeks to develop a new blood test for PE that is just as sensitive as the existing D-Dimer test, but that also has the higher specificity needed to screen and stratify all emergency department patients with PE-like symptoms. The expected impact of such a test would be to increase patient safety by reducing the overuse of radiative imaging, standardize clinical care processes, reduce costs and save lives.",Development of a Novel Diagnostic Test for Pulmonary Embolism Based on Artificial Intelligence and Spectral Analysis of Blood,10081921,R43HL154941,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood coagulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest Pain', 'Creatine Kinase MB Isoenzyme', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dyspnea', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrin fragment D', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunoassay', 'Intravenous', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myoglobin', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Syncope', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Troponin I', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Venous system', 'Vermont', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'instrumentation', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient safety', 'performance tests', 'point of care', 'standard of care', 'targeted biomarker', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,BIOCOGNIV INC.,R43,2020,299749,-0.027859841728377573
"A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease Project Summary There is an obvious need for new approaches and better assays for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease. All attempts to develop a practical assay for the direct detection of Borrelia burgdorferi in infected patients have failed. Thus far, all proposed alternatives to serology have been unsuccessful, not cost-effective, or are still in early development. Improving serological detection in early disease is the fastest and most effective way to improve patient outcomes in Lyme disease. The antigen targets utilized in current serodiagnostic assays have considerable defects. They often contain conserved epitopes that cross-react with antibodies raised to other antigens, reducing specificity and requiring the use of a two-tier seroassay paradigm that preserves specificity at the cost of poor sensitivity in the detection of early disease. The use of peptides as serodiagnostic targets demonstrate improved efficacy, but the use of one or two peptides containing single epitopes still provides re- duced sensitivity in early disease. Putting the same old antigen targets into new platforms, no matter how in- novative the platform, will not succeed in improving serodiagnostics for Lyme disease. Both the target anti- gens and assays need an innovative approach. By incorporating unique peptides containing linear epitopes highly specific to B. burgdorferi, into a cutting-edge, multiplex, portable paper-based point-of-care diagnostic assay that uses a cost-effective smartphone-based reader, we aim to transform the diagnosis of Lyme disease. An ideal test for Lyme disease could be performed in a single step and yield an answer on the spot to support diagnosis and direct the course of clinical treatment. We have developed an innovative vertical-flow assay which allows for the multiplexed detection of IgM and IgG binding of up to 25 independent antigen targets in a point-of-care setting. The VFA design allows for uniform flow of sample across the target membrane, creating uniform binding conditions and maximizing developed signal. We coupled this design with a cost-effective portable smart-phone based reader allowing for quantitative measure of antibody binding, eliminating subjectiv- ity. By multiplexing peptide antigens each containing 1-2 epitopes unique to B. burgdorferi from multiple differ- ent antigens expressed at different stages during mammalian infection we can generate a single tier, POC as- say that can specifically and sensitively detect patient antibody at all stages of the disease. The assay can be completed in less than 25 min allowing for rapid in office results to support clinical diagnosis, thereby improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Early diagnosis of Lyme disease is critical to prevent disease progression and sequelae; however current laboratory diagnostics that are used to support clinical diagnosis are insensitive during early infection, failing ~50% of the time. We propose the development of a sensitive and specific multi-antigen point-of-care assay that will provide immediate serological detection of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, to aid in physician diagnosis. Accurate, rapid diagnosis will improve patient outcomes by reducing the likelihood of developing potentially debilitating late stage disease through early antibiotic intervention.",A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease,10080510,R44AI150060,"['Address', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Bedside Testings', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Borrelia miyamotoi', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Coupled', 'DBL Oncoprotein', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'ITGB3 gene', 'ImProv', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Diagnosis', 'Legal patent', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'OspC protein', 'Paper', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cross reactivity', 'decorin binding protein B', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'multiplex detection', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'portability', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'relapsing fever borrelia', 'screening']",NIAID,"BIOPEPTIDES, INC.",R44,2020,300000,-0.008683683466401164
"BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, and shingles lead to significant rates of illness, hospitalization, and death among older adults. In the United States, vaccination rates have been mostly unchanged for a decade with lower rates among racial and ethnic minority groups. New and scalable approaches are needed to address this important public health issue. Nudges are changes to the way choices are offered or information is framed that can have outsized effects on behavior. For example, default options are the path of least resistance and the action that takes place if no alternatives are selected. Active choice is a method that prompts a decision-making now, rather than waiting for stakeholders to recognize the need to make the decision on their own. Our groups at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Medicine) and the University of Washington (UW Medicine) have formed behavioral design teams embedded within the operations of our health systems and have demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, this scalable technology platform is an optimal environment to implement and deploy these types of nudges. In this study, we propose to design, test, and implemented personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target barriers among high-risk subgroups to improve vaccination rates. We will pilot this at two health systems and then implement a pragmatic trial at those health systems and sites in the VA Health System. In the R61 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine and UW Medicine. Aim 1: To use EHR data and analytical methods to identify high-risk groups of older adults with suboptimal vaccination rates for influenza, pneumococcal disease, and herpes zoster. Aim 2: To assess the feasibility of implementing different types of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target the identified groups to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 3: To pilot test ways to personalize promising nudges to clinicians and patients for improving vaccination among older adults. In the R33 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine, UW Medicine, and the VA Health System. Aim 1: To conduct a 12-month, multisite, cluster randomized, pragmatic trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients relative to control to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on reducing disparities in vaccination rates related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic factors. Aim 3: To evaluate heterogeneity in treatment effect across clinician, patient, and practice characteristics to further tailor approaches in future intervention design. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many older adults are at risk of illness, hospitalization, and death from vaccine-preventable diseases. Moreover, there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in care with even lower vaccination rates among African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. In this study, we will use analytical methods to identify high-risk subgroups, test personalized nudges to address barriers among these groups, and then implement a pragmatic, multisite trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to improve vaccination rates among older adults and reduce disparities in care.",BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR,10050234,R61AG068945,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Asians', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Health Services', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Vendor', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Workload', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'ethnic minority population', 'health care disparity', 'health service use', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'multi-site trial', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'peer', 'personalized approach', 'pragmatic trial', 'prescription opioid', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'response', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'treatment effect']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R61,2020,315340,0.015552884061123554
"CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Project Summary/Abstract Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In determine an exploratory ML analysis, we will the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are strongly linked t o functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,9980111,R01MH120091,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2020,317000,-0.005892367712107195
"Administrative Supplement to Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual's independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer's disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual's quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. PROJECT NARRATIVE: In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA).

"DAT- Implementing routine screening for cannabis and other drug use disorders in primary care: impact on diagnosis and treatment in a randomized pragmatic trial in 22 clinics PROJECT SUMMARY DAT18-06 The personal, social, and public health burdens of substance use disorders (SUDs) in the United States have been compounded by the opioid epidemic and legalization of recreational and medical cannabis use. Traditionally, healthcare systems have referred patients with SUDs to specialists. Although SUD treatment is associated with improved outcomes, most people with SUDs remain unidentified and untreated. The magnitude of unmet need has led experts to recommend incorporating screening and assessment for SUDs into routine primary care (PC), to increase rates of diagnosis and treatment of SUDs. Despite extensive observational research, to our knowledge no randomized controlled trial has evaluated the impact of PC-based programs of screening and assessment on new SUD treatment. The proposed study takes advantage of a unique and fortuitous opportunity to evaluate the impact of a PC program of screening and assessment for SUDs on new diagnosis and treatment of SUDs. The Sustained Patient-centered Alcohol Related Care (SPARC) trial, completed in July 2018, was a rigorously-designed randomized implementation trial testing a multifaceted approach to improving care for unhealthy alcohol use. However, at the request of clinical leaders at Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) where the SPARC program was implemented, routine screening and assessment for opioid, cannabis, and other drug use disorders (CUD, OUD, and DUD, respectively) were added before the trial was launched in 22 KPWA PC clinics. As a result, the SPARC trial's implementation program—consisting of practice coaching, electronic health record (EHR) support, performance monitoring and feedback, and provider training—also targeted SUDs. Data from health system monitoring reports indicate the trial achieved high, sustained rates of screening for SUDs, exceeding the target of 80% of patients with PC visits. However, the SPARC trial was only funded to evaluate alcohol-related outcomes. The proposed study will rigorously evaluate the SPARC program's impact on the clinically meaningful primary outcome of new SUD treatment within 90 days of a primary care visit (Aim 1). To illuminate potential continued gaps in the quality of SUD care (Aim 2), we will use natural language processing (NLP) to extract and quantify reasons why: 1) patients reporting ≥4 DSM-5 symptoms of SUDs do not receive formal coded diagnoses of OUD, CUD, or DUD, and 2) why patients with newly diagnosed OUDs, CUDs, and DUDs do not received treatment. Most people with OUDs, CUDs, and other DUDs are never treated. An estimated 2.5-3.9% of US adults have past-year SUDs, and nearly 90% report no SUD treatment. Yet >84% of US adults have outpatient visits annually, and over half of these visits are in PC. If the proposed innovative study demonstrates that screening and assessment in PC increase SUD treatment, it would provide support for a widely endorsed yet previously untested approach to addressing a critically important gap in the quality of care for SUDs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Drug use disorders associated with unhealthy opioid, cannabis, and other drug use are major public health concerns but most people with these disorders remain untreated. Experts recommend systematic screening and assessment in primary care as a way to improve SUD treatment, but the effectiveness of such programs is unknown. This study rigorously evaluates such a program through an opportunity created when screening and assessment for drug use disorders were unexpectedly added to a randomized, stepped wedge, 22-clinic trial originally planned to focus exclusively on alcohol use disorders.",DAT- Implementing routine screening for cannabis and other drug use disorders in primary care: impact on diagnosis and treatment in a randomized pragmatic trial in 22 clinics,9884229,R01DA047312,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohols', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Medical', 'Medical Marijuana', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Observational Study', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Shame', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'brief intervention', 'care providers', 'design', 'disability', 'health data', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'implementation trial', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'marijuana use', 'neglect', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'patient oriented', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'social', 'social stigma', 'therapy design']",NIDA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,323000,-0.027659778785047176
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias. Results from this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations.",Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae,9972960,R01MH110453,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Attention', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Etiology', 'Explosion', 'Family', 'Fire - disasters', 'Future', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personality Disorders', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Poisoning', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Variant', 'Work', 'assault', 'base', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'member', 'novel', 'population based', 'post-trauma', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sexual assault', 'social', 'statistical and machine learning', 'time use', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,324735,-0.004651610296818213
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination  Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension Title: Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension The American Diabetes Association estimates that over 25.8 million Americans have diabetes. Proper patient self-management is perhaps the most critical and under-exercised element for patients to achieve appropriate glycemic control and thus mitigate complications and comorbid conditions, and implement appropriate preventive strategies (e.g., vaccines, exercise, healthy diet). In previous work we have shown that educating patients by using content in their medical records improved diabetes outcomes and that NoteAid, a multi- module natural language processing system that links medical jargon in electronic health records to definitions, has improved self-reported comprehension.

"The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery SUMMARY - OVERALL In personalized medicine, the care of each patient is guided by his/her unique clinical circumstances. At its foundation, however, this paradigm holds a concurrent need for personalized science, in which technologies are developed and hypothesis explored in light of individual diversity. Critically, this diversity also includes unique microbial populations, which can augment the onset, progression, and treatment of disease. Within the field of benign urology, one of the most common pathologies—urinary tract infections (UTIs)—is also one of the most heterogenous, as the risk factors, symptomatology, and outcomes can vary significantly from patient to patient. Not surprisingly, the complexity of UTIs extends beyond the host, with tremendous genotypic and phenotypic diversity among the species/strains of microbes that elicit these infections. To better align the management of UTIs with the goals of precision care, our understanding of pathophysiology must become more nuanced, as we network in tandem the inherent diversity of host and microbe. To these ends, we propose a resource that provides an interconnected picture of both components, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository (VUIR). With our institution's unique foundation in medical informatics, we will create a searchable database of clinical parameters from bacteriuric patients (many thousands of cases annually), together with microbiologic data on the organisms. In parallel, the paired microbial strains will be stored permanently as a biobank for analysis and experimentation, together with linkage to anonymized versions of patient records within Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative (a filtered version of our electronic health data). The logistical infrastructure for clinical biobanking is also already in place at Vanderbilt via the institutionally-supported microVU initiative, in which microbial isolates from the diagnostic laboratory are repurposed as academic resources. As a basic expansion of these efforts, the VUIR will represent a first-in-kind tool for developing technologies to combat UTIs, while also investigating their underlying pathogenesis. In particular, it could facilitate functional genomic studies that bridge host and pathogen. Demonstrating the resource's value, we will conduct whole-genome sequencing of clinically underrepresented bacterial species, together with genome-wide association studies that focus on the infection phenotypes of the source-patients. In addition to novel virulence factors, we seek to identify elusive genomic determinants that distinguish cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and symptomatic UTI. The molecular basis of UTI-versus-ASB epitomizes a clinical challenge that requires integration of host and pathogen, as provided by the VUIR. Finally, to support the program and its discoveries, we propose an organizational structure of multidisciplinary content-area experts and dedicated support staff. Along with coordinating daily activities and assuring seamless dissemination of data/specimens, this Administrative Core (AdCore) will champion educational activities and additional pilot projects that build upon the resource. In sum, the VUIR stands to generate actionable discoveries from the human and microbial diversity of UTIs—not in spite of it. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERALL Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not only a common urologic ailment, but one of the most widespread medical conditions facing women, men and children around the globe. In order for clinicians to better manage UTIs—and scientists to understand them more deeply—our clinical viewpoint must become personalized, as we study in tandem the afflicted patients and offending pathogens. To these ends, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository will provide a first-in-kind resource for the biomedical community, creating a massive network of patient-level clinical data and banked microbial strains from patients with real-world infections.","The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery",10022297,P20DK123967,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Advisory Committees', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Area', 'Bacteriuria', 'Benign', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Published Comment', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Uropathogen', 'Virulence Factors', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'career development', 'clinical database', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical sequencing', 'combat', 'data dissemination', 'data mining', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'men', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic microbe', 'patient health information', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'urologic', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P20,2020,340000,-0.011149420511466557
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018,9998934,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antioxidants', 'Apical', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Budesonide', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Chinese People', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'Taiwan', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vitamin E', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'bile salts', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'hepatotoxin', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outreach', 'pediatric patients', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'transcriptomics', 'transport inhibitor', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,344849,0.0017978829290519328
"Improving patient and caregiver engagement through the application of data science methods to audio recorded clinic visits stored in personal health libraries PROJECT SUMMARY

methods to securely analyze clinic visit recordings and make this information accessible and understandable  for patients;; and Aim 3 Demonstrate the usability and use of an Audio-­PHL in older adults with multimorbidity  and caregivers. Applicants hypothesize: (1) The Audio-­PHL will surpass acceptable usability metrics in older  adults and caregivers and (2) natural language processing (NLP) methods developed for the Audio-­PHL will  accurately identify key visit information (e.g. medication) and connect it to credible patient resources. The  development of the Audio-­PHL follows a user centered design model. In Aim 1, the applicants will use  participatory design activities with 48 end-­users to inform Audio-­PHL design. In Aim 2, the Audio-­PHL will be  created in iterative cycles informed by findings from Aim 1. In Aim 3, extensive usability evaluation will be  conducted in human computer interaction (HCI) laboratory settings to ensure Audio-­PHL surpasses acceptable

(control) with no recordings. Usability metrics and satisfaction will be assessed at one-­month. Preliminary data  on the impact of an Audio-­PHL on patient ability to seek, find and use health information with high confidence,  patient activation and caregiver confidence will also be gathered. The research is innovative because it will  provide patients and caregivers secure access to a PHL based on clinic-­recordings that uses data science  methods to organize visit information and connect it to trusted resources. The results are expected to have a

benefits of clinic recordings through the novel application of data science methods, to improve health outcomes  for older adults with multimorbidity through greater knowledge and confidence in their ability to self-­manage.   PROJECT NARRATIVE    Between 40 – 80% of clinic visit information is forgotten immediately by patients, a significant impediment to  self-­management for older adults with multimorbidity that leads to poor health outcomes. The proposed

"Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) is a lethal neoplasm and a common hematologic malignancy. MM is uniformly preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Unlike MM, patients with MGUS are asymptomatic. The current management for MGUS is watchful waiting for disease progression. A marked racial disparity in this disease area is long-established with a 2 to 3-fold increased risk in African Americans (AAs) compared to Caucasians. Moreover, obesity is a risk factor for MM independent of race. Obesity is prevalent in U.S. adults, and particularly more prevalent among AAs than Caucasians. As a result, without any intervention, racial disparities in this disease will continue to worsen. Metformin, a widely-used, safe, well- tolerated, and inexpensive medication, induces weight loss and has been found to be more effective in glycemic control in AAs compared to Caucasians. It has also been used in prospective trials for non-diabetes indications and solid tumor malignancies. We therefore hypothesize that metformin use in MGUS patients will prevent MM and reduce MM disparities. This project plans to focus on the precursor condition of MM – MGUS. The findings from the proposed project will inform biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials. The long-term goal is to identify intervention strategies to prevent the progression of MGUS to MM, reduce the overall burden of MM, and reduce MM disparities. We plan to identify whether high body mass index (BMI) and/or significant change in BMI over the life course are risk factors for MGUS by race (Aim 1), utilizing linked databases with nearly lifelong follow-up of BMI and other health measures ,as well as utilizing artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning approaches, to perform big data analyses. We will then assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory after MGUS diagnosis in metformin versus non-metformin users in a subgroup of MGUS patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (Aim 2.1) and the association of metformin use with the progression of MGUS to MM (Aim 2.2). Last, we will assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory in the subgroup of MGUS patients without diabetes mellitus (Aim 3). This project is significant in its capability to 1) identify perhaps the only modifiable risk factor (high BMI) to inform interventions to prevent MM; 2) identify a dynamic marker for disease progression by race (M-protein concentration), where these biomarkers can be a surrogate for MM diagnosis in future prevention trials; and 3) reduce MM health disparities by a) identifying race-specific biomarkers for MGUS and MGUS progression, available through clinical encounters (as opposed to expensive genetic testing); and b) exploring metformin use as a chemopreventive measure. It is innovative in its 1) focus on MM prevention rather than treatment and 2) utilization of artificial intelligence to analyze big data. Successful completion of this study will provide evidence for a paradigm shift in current clinical practice of MGUS management and help prevent MM, an incurable and costly disease. More importantly, it will provide evidence to guide interventions to reduce MM disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in multiple myeloma (MM), a common and incurable malignancy whose management is extremely costly, are long-established. Although MM is preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by many years, no established prevention strategies exist and current clinical practice does not treat patients with MGUS; thus, racial disparities for this disease are expected to persist or even worsen due to the disproportionate burden of obesity – a known risk factor for MM – in the African American population. This project plans to study racial differences in risk factors/biomarkers for MGUS and the progression of MGUS to MM to inform future biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials with the goal of reducing MM health disparities.",Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective,10055834,R01CA253475,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caucasians', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Department of Defense', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metformin', 'Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Neoplasms', 'Obesity', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Race', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Subgroup', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'carcinogenicity', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'diabetic', 'follow-up', 'genetic testing', 'glycemic control', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'innovation', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'specific biomarkers', 'working group']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,360281,0.004189189813537858
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,9962316,R37CA242545,"['Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Heart Rate', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'chemotherapy', 'common treatment', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mobile computing', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symptom management', 'trial comparing', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2020,361165,-0.0007892801545329517
"Assisted living communities- transforming predictive data into proactive care for COVID-19 ABSTRACT Recent data suggests that that older Americans who contact COVID-19 are at greatest risk for hospitalization and poor outcomes. Additionally, due to advanced age and their high likelihood of having multiple chronic conditions, adults in senior living facilities are at highest risk for developing COVID-19, its most serious complications, and dying. Since the identification of first US case of novel coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) in the Seattle, Washington, several outbreaks have been identified in long-term care and assisted living facilities with evidence of rapid spread. Older residents and the staff of long-term care assisted living facilities as well as public health officials are facing a multitude of challenges which render early detection of COVID-19 infections difficult in these facilities and which have posed a major barrier to the efforts to control the spread of infection. Adding to these challenges, more than half of residents with positive COVID-19 test results are asymptomatic at the time of testing, further contributing to transmission. There is an urgent unmet need for strategies for monitoring of residents in long-term care and assisted living facilities to facilitate early detection of the infection using means that require minimal person-to-person contact. While the dynamics of COVID-19 infection spread is being addressed by several contact tracing apps, assessing the risk for development of severe symptoms and hospitalization in these community residents requires active physiological monitoring and ecological momentary assessment in the context of preexisting clinical conditions and presents an immediate unmet need. With this project, we propose to deliver a user- friendly COVID-19 early detection alert platform (COVID-Alert) that integrates: 1) biosensor ensemble that noninvasively and continuously monitor and record critical vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and activity level); 2) ecological momentary assessment (EMA) using the 5-question set released by CDC and adopted across US by healthcare providers and health insurance industry; 3) artificial intelligence framework that triggers an alert based on synthesis of real-time physiological biosensing data feed, EMA monitoring of symptoms, with personalized risk profiles of preexisting conditions derived from electronic health record maintained by the facility. COVID-19 clinical decision support integrated into the workflow of long-term care facilities will ensure that residents receive appropriate and timely care (resident level) and ongoing surveillance to prevent an outbreak (facility level) while avoiding unnecessary staff exposure. This study brings together a strong interdisciplinary team of experts in engineering, informatics, data science, machine learning, and CDS. The advanced data-driven predictive model will be trained and validated using both high-dimensional EHR data and clinician feedback. The process of the algorithm development and clinical implementation will be closely monitored and evaluated through formative and summative evaluation. NARRATIVE Due to advanced age and their high likelihood of having multiple chronic conditions, adults in senior living facilities are at highest risk for hospitalization from COVID-19, its most serious complications, and dying. Our team will develop and perform formative and summative evaluation of a COVID-19 early detection/hospitalization risk prediction platform, which will provide actionable clinical decision support.

"Inflammatory and ADRD Biomarker Predictors of Perioperative Digital Clock Drawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",Inflammatory and ADRD Biomarker Predictors of Perioperative Digital Clock Drawing,10121051,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2020,373517,0.011977386440744019
"Biases introduced by filtering electronic health records for patients with ""complete data"" PROJECT SUMMARY Nationwide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to the increasing availability of large clinical datasets. With statistical modeling and machine learning, these datasets have been be used in a wide range of applications, including diagnosis, decision support, cost reduction, and personalized medicine. However, because the same patient could be treated at multiple health care institutions, data from only a single EHR might not contain the complete medical history for that patient, with critical events potentially missing. A common approach to addressing this problem is to apply data checks that filter the EHR for patients whose data appear to be more “complete”. Examples of filters include requiring at least one visit per year or ensuring that age, sex, and race are all recorded. However, in a previous study using EHR data from seven institutions, we showed that these filters can greatly reduce the sample size and introduce unexpected biases by selecting sicker patients who seek care more often and changing the demographics of the resulting cohorts. This project extends this prior research by implementing an expanded set of data completeness filters and testing their accuracy and potential biases using a combination of national claims data and EHR data from dozens of hospitals and healthcare centers across the country. This will enable us to understand how data completeness varies in different EHRs and quantify the tradeoffs of different approaches to correcting for gaps in patients' records. First, we will develop and measure the accuracy of data completeness filters using national claims data. This provides a “gold standard” of longitudinal data where patients' complete medical histories are known during the periods in which they were enrolled in the insurance plan. After partitioning the data by provider groups to model gaps in EHR data, we will test how well data completeness filters, individually and in combined machine learning models, select patients with fewer gaps. We will then test whether the filters introduce biases by selecting sicker patients (more diagnoses, more visits, etc.) or changing their demographic characteristics (age, sex, and zip code). Then, we will test the filters on EHR data, first at a single large medical center, and then across a national network of 57 institutions, representing different geographic regions, patient populations, number of years of data, and types of health care facilities. We will evaluate the filters by measuring whether they improve the performance of a machine learning model for predicting hospital admissions. Our ultimate goals are to (a) help researchers balance the need for complete data with the biases this might introduce to their models and (b) help them predict how well models trained on one EHR dataset might work on other EHRs with different data completeness profiles. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nationwide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to the increasing availability of large clinical datasets. However, because the same patient could be treated at multiple health care institutions, data from only a single EHR might not contain the complete medical history for that patient, with critical events potentially missing.

"Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction. We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece- dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as- sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and debilitating disorder. Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu- ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to 75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir- ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time- and resource-intensive. In this secondary data analysis, we will examine methods for automating delirium recog- nition and risk prediction in electronic health records using machine learning and natural language processing computer algorithms, which in turn will lead to improved care for this serious but often overlooked disorder.",Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records,9873880,R01AG060993,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alabama', 'Algorithms', 'Ally', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational algorithm', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Staff', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Provider', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care costs', 'confusion assessment method', 'data mining', 'epidemiology study', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'health care settings', 'high dimensionality', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'model development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phrases', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'ward']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,376860,0.001335061914742814
"2/5 CAPER Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML historical analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and predicators;Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative  Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",2/5 CAPER Computerized assessment of psychosis risk,9978241,R01MH120088,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,377685,-0.005568234457077935
"Refinement of a rapid saliva miRNA diagnostic test for concussion Summary/Abstract - Quadrant Biosciences is developing a new diagnostic to aid in the clinical detection of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in school-aged children and young adults (13–22 years). Based on salivary microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers, Quadrant’s diagnostic will provide an accurate, objective, and non-invasive method for mTBI diagnosis. Such a method is critically needed, as the number of pediatric mTBIs is on the rise, and the developing brains of young patients are more vulnerable to the after-effects of mechanical forces, leading to a wide range of negative effects on physical, cognitive, and psychological function. The diagnosis and assessment of mTBI in adolescents are challenging and rely on subjective measures, leading many mTBIs to go undiagnosed or underreported. This results in suboptimal post-injury treatment and patient management. A biologic assay to accurately diagnose adolescent mTBI would therefore provide an invaluable guide for clinical care, potentially guiding decisions for imaging, return to play, return to school, and therapeutic interventions. While a number of potential biomarkers for objectively detecting mTBI have been proposed, including the blood biomarkers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase (UCH-L1), recent research questions the ability of blood-based biomarkers to differentiate patients with mTBI from those with acute orthopedic trauma, particularly in pediatric populations. Moreover, these assays require venipuncture expertise that is not always available, particularly in the case of sports-related concussions, which account for nearly 1/3 of mTBIs in this patient population. To address these shortcomings, Quadrant Biosciences is creating a novel, objective diagnostic tool based on a panel of saliva miRNA biomarkers that are differentially expressed in patients with mTBI. Pilot studies in over 200 individuals with mTBI have identified a panel of saliva miRNAs capable of diagnosing mTBI and predicting symptom duration. In the proposed Fast Track project, Quadrant will advance development of this test by establishing a rapid, accurate method for quantifying these miRNAs and refining/validating a diagnostic algorithm to differentiate adolescents and young adults with mTBI from peers with symptomology that mimics mTBI (e.g. chronic headaches, anxiety/depression, ADHD, exercise-related fatigue, and orthopedic injury). In Phase I, Quadrant will refine a diagnostic algorithm for mTBI using a rapid quantification technique for saliva miRNAs. Machine learning will be used to develop a diagnostic algorithm that employs miRNA levels from the rapid multiplex assay alongside participant medical and demographic characteristics to predict mTBI status. In Phase II, Quadrant will validate the diagnostic algorithm for differentiating mTBI from medical conditions with overlapping symptomology in a prospective, case-control study of 2500 adolescents and young adults (age 13–22 years) to refine the saliva-based diagnostic aid for mTBI. Ultimately, Quadrant’s proposed salivary miRNA-based test will yield a minimally invasive, objective, biologic test that can aid diagnosis of mTBI, including among patients with confounding psychologic conditions. Narrative - Children and adolescents account for approximately 2/3 of the 3 million concussions that occur in the U.S. each year, placing them at risk for negative impacts on physical, cognitive, and psychological function, including poor academic performance, behavior, social interactions, and reduced subsequent employment. Unfortunately, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is underdiagnosed due to the poor sensitivity of conventional methods (neurological assessment, self-reporting, imaging, etc.) and lack of an objective, non-invasive diagnostic tool. Quadrant Biosciences’ rapid, accurate, objective aid for the diagnosis of mTBIs in adolescents and young adults will enable timely and accurate decision-making in mTBI assessment, resulting in reduced re- injury/morbidity, individualized patient management, and improved long-term patient outcomes.",Refinement of a rapid saliva miRNA diagnostic test for concussion,10081522,R42NS119119,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Headaches', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Emergency department visit', 'Employment', 'Exercise', 'Fatigue', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Headache', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Olfactory Nerve', 'Oral cavity', 'Orthopedics', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein C', 'RNA Sequences', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Sports', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Venipunctures', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'aging population', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical care', 'concussive symptom', 'design', 'diagnostic panel', 'differential expression', 'improved', 'mechanical force', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'minimally invasive', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'peer', 'personalized management', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase', 'young adult']",NINDS,"QUADRANT BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R42,2020,380848,5.811919248592793e-05
"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows. We aim to develop a quantitative risk model for oral cavity cancer patients, 25-37% of whom will experience debilitating post-treatment recurrence. Using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we will develop and validate our risk model on a large multi-site cohort of patients, and develop an AI-assisted synoptic report-filling tool for integrating into clinical practice.

"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions. NARRATIVE Timely acute stroke treatments can be life-saving and reduce disability from stroke; however, a minority of patients receive these treatments in a timely manner or at all.

"Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data ABSTRACT Since early January 2020, our interdisciplinary research team has conducted several studies to elucidate the emerging threat of COVID-19 and support public health responses throughout the United States, resulting in peer-reviewed publications, online COVID-19 forecasting tools, and extensive engagement with city, state and national decision makers. In our collaboration with the CDC to develop a national modeling resource for pandemic preparedness, we had recently developed a national model for evaluating multi-layered intervention strategies to contain and mitigate outbreaks in US cities. We adapted the model to COVID-19 by incorporating the latest estimates for age- and risk-group specific rates of transmission, disease progression, asymptomatic infections, and severity (including risks of hospitalization, critical care, ventilation and death). The model is designed to flexibly incorporate combinations of social distancing, contact tracing-isolation, antiviral prophylaxis and treatment, as well as vaccination strategies. Our Supplementary Aims propose to build a more granular and data-driven model of COVID-19 to elucidate the transmission, identify high-risk populations, surveillance targets and effective control of this and future epidemics within US cities. Aim S1: Focusing initially on the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan area in Texas, we will apply these models to improve real-time risk assessments and optimize the timing and extent of layered social distancing measures. Aim S2: We will rapidly evaluate strategies for rolling out antiviral prophylaxis and therapy based on clinical trial data. Aim S3: We will develop user interfaces for our Austin and national models to support both scientific research and public health efforts to mitigate COVID-19 and plan for future pandemic threats. These Aims are synergistic with Specific Aim 2 of our parent grant (R01 AI151176-01), in which we are developing high-resolution models of viral transmission to improve the early detection and control of anomalous respiratory viruses, particularly in at risk populations. NARRATIVE Our Supplementary Aims will accelerate the development of a flexible and granular model of COVID-19 emergence, transmission and control within US cities. Leveraging unprecedented data and a high level engagement with city and state leadership in the Austin-Round Rock MSA and Texas, we will rapidly improve our existing models to evaluate strategies for real-time surveillance and multifaceted interventions including non-pharmaceutical measures (eg, adaptive social distancing and cocooning of high risk populations) as well as future antiviral drugs to mitigate COVID-19. Finally, we will develop user-friendly interfaces for our models to support research and public health decision making for COVID-19 and future pandemic threats.","Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data",10150283,R01AI151176,"['Age', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'COVID-19', 'Categories', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Contact Tracing', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Surveillance', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Social Distance', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United States', 'Update', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Visualization', 'austin', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'multi-component intervention', 'pandemic disease', 'pandemic preparedness', 'parent grant', 'prevent', 'respiratory virus', 'response', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly', 'vaccination strategy', 'ventilation', 'viral transmission']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,387199,0.007581217324570915
"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,9841436,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'defined contribution', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'effective intervention', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preservation', 'response', 'risk variant', 'success', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,395000,-0.004929970893086266
"Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment Diagnosis-based risk adjustment is widely used in the US and abroad for health plan payment, notably for Medicare Parts C and D, for commercial contracting and quality assessment, and in numerous state Medicaid programs. Yet the risk adjustment technology used for payments has not kept up with improved classification systems, larger patient datasets, improved estimation algorithms or recent theoretical and clinical developments. Our work will take advantage of the richer ICD-10-CM classification system, in use since October 2015, with over 5 times as many diagnoses as ICD-9-CM Codes. ICD-10 codes now recognize: left vs. right side for thousands of conditions, distinguish between initial, subsequent and sequela diagnoses, and incorporate hundreds of new clinical, demographic and biometric variables. Based on the ICD-10, more exact models can leverage increased diagnostic coding accuracy to reduce opportunities for gaming or discriminating against patients with conditions who are predicted to be unprofitable. Led by two of the three developers of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS-HCC) existing classification system, our team of physicians, public policy experts, statisticians and economists will comprehensively improve the accuracy of risk adjustment and predictive models using larger sample sizes, clinical judgment and state-of-art economic and statistical modeling. We will also expand the conventional regression methods explored, to include machine learning algorithms, constrained regression, and LASSO estimation. We will calculate a new “appropriateness to include” (ATI) score that captures diagnostic vagueness, discretion and suitability for use in risk adjustment models, and use this score to inform which variables are included in plan payment formulas. Selection incentives remain of concern in public US health plan payments formulas and may be costing Medicare over $5 billion per year (NBER 2017). Prediction and payment models from this project can reduce overpayment and offset plan incentives to skimp on services that attract sick people. To ensure that these models and formulas are useful for enrollees of all ages, they will initially be calibrated and tested on large commercially-insured claims data, covering ages 0 to 64. They will then be validated and refined for Medicare, Medicaid, and state employees using data from All-Payer Claims Data from five states and a second large commercial dataset. We will make development steps, statistical programs, and full details of the classification system and prediction formulas publicly available for comment, refinement, and use by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers. Project Narrative This project will develop new classification systems and new prediction and payment models that take advantage of the fivefold increase in diagnostic codes available with the October 2015 change from ICD- 9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Using data from two national claims datasets and five state all-payer claims datasets that collectively cover over 75 million enrollees, we will identify new, underutilized ICD-10 capabilities, create new clusters of diagnoses useful for prediction, develop new algorithms for using these clusters, and estimate formulas that predict spending, utilization and diverse health care outcomes for all ages. Methods and results will be publicly described and software posted on the web for use in risk adjustment and diverse clinical, financial, policy evaluation, and quality assessment outcomes by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers.",Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment,9965911,R01HS026485,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2020,399950,0.0017064854753332304
"4/5 CAPER: Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains. This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative  Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",4/5 CAPER: Computerized assessment of psychosis risk,9983971,R01MH120092,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2020,401699,-0.005906072961584482
"Exploring the role of gonadotropins in Down syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Down syndrome (DS) is a common chromosomal disorder that results from the triplication of chromosome 21. Comorbid medical conditions frequently occur among individuals with DS; however, opthalamic disorders such as keratoconus occurs 6 times more often among this population as compared to the general population. Keratoconus is a known multifactorial, progressive, degenerative disease of the cornea; however, the etiology of the disease remains unclear. Our recent work has found that hormone-regulated Prolactin-Induced Protein (PIP) is a potential biomarker of keratoconus but the link between DS and keratoconus remains unclear. Pathway analysis has further linked comorbid DS and keratoconus through gonadotropins and serum amyloid A1 (SAA), a protein linked in a series of studies to cognitive dysfunction among adults with DS. The proposed study aims to determine and validate the role of gonadotropins in the DS population with the keratoconus co-morbidity with the long-term goal to better understand the underlying mechanisms that result in increased risk for ocular co-morbidities such as keratoconus among this population. This pilot study will include n=90 participants (n=30 DS; n=30 comorbid DS and Keratoconus; n=30 healthy controls). All participants will provide biofluid samples of tears and plasma, which will be assayed on an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) platform. Analyses will be performed using R and SPSS 24 (IBM) in a series of steps. Support Vector Machine (SVM) analyses will be applied to examine the use of biomarkers to detect disease presence (i.e. keratoconus comorbidity). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses will help with variable selection in order to enhance the prediction accuracy of the models. Biomarkers will include hormone specific (LSH, LH, GNRH, LHR, FSHR, GNRHR) as well as a panel of plasma proteins including biomarkers of inflammation linked with cognitive dysfunction (SAA, CRP, ICAM1, VCAM1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IL-5, IL-7, Eotaxin-3, TARC, A2M, B2M, FVII, TNC, Adiponectin, FABP-3, IL-18, PPY, TPO and I-309). Diagnosis of keratoconus will be utilized as the dependent variable. If successful, data obtained from this study could help facility the development of a screening tool for detecting individuals with DS who are at risk for development of keratoconus, with the goal of defining potential enrollment into clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Vision disorders occur in nearly all individuals with Down syndrome (DS) with development of ocular co-morbidities such as keratoconus, a cornea dystrophy, occurring 6 times more often in this population as compared to the general population. Recent work from our group has found differences in sex hormones (i.e. androgen and estrogen levels) among individuals with keratoconus as compared to healthy controls but this difference was impacted by age and gender. Information gained from this study will (1) reveal the relationship between gonadotropins among individuals with DS and ocular comorbidities, specifically keratoconus, and (2) provide insight into the association between known plasma biomarkers including serum amyloid A1 and gonadotrophins among those with DS as well as those with comorbid keratoconus and DS.",Exploring the role of gonadotropins in Down syndrome,10108508,R21EY032320,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Androgens', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blepharitis', 'Blood', 'CCL1 gene', 'CCL17 gene', 'CCL26 gene', 'Cataract', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome 21', 'Clinical Trials', 'Congenital chromosomal disease', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Corneal dystrophy', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Eye Development', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Future', 'GNRH1 gene', 'GNRH2 gene', 'GNRHR gene', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Hormones', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Gonadotropins', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'ICAM1 gene', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-18', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interleukin-7', 'Keratoconus', 'Lacrimal Duct Obstruction', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic Nystagmus', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Play', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prolactin', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Readiness', 'Refractive Errors', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Strabismus', 'TNF gene', 'Thinness', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Vision Disorders', 'Visual Acuity', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adiponectin', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'insight', 'link protein', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'programs', 'receptor', 'sex', 'support vector machine']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R21,2020,403584,-0.015250233979695318
"Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold-standard method of evaluating cancer treatment, which has immense health and economic burdens worldwide. However, practical considerations that allow an RCT to be conducted typically require a relatively small sample size and restricted eligibility criteria such that the study has inadequate power to generalize treatment effects to elderly patients or other under-represented patient pop- ulations. On the other hand, massive real-world data (RWD) are increasingly captured by population-based databases and registries, such as Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), SEER-Medicare, and National Cancer Database (NCDB), that have much broader demographic and clinical diversity compared to RCT cohorts. Treatment evaluation using causal inference methods and RWD that were not collected purely for re- search purposes is now frequently performed but fraught with limitations such as confounding due to lack of randomization. In fact, the agreement between RCT and RWD ﬁndings is often low in the analysis of matched RCT and RWD studies with the same treatment comparisons. Although several national organizations and reg- ulatory agencies have advocated using RWD to complement RCTs, methods that integrate these two potentially complementary data sources and achieve better treatment evaluation over the use of a single data source alone have yet to be developed.  This proposal is motivated by the PIs' collaborative work to study the safety and efﬁcacy of treatment strategies for elderly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal cancer patients by integrating data from multiple sources: RCTs from NCI cooperative groups and the real-world databases (e.g. SEER, SEER-Medicare, and NCDB). The objective of this project is to develop new statistical methods for integrative analyses of RCTs and RWD that can improve the generalizability and increase estimation efﬁciency of RCT ﬁndings to more diverse ""real-world"" patients as well as under-studied populations while avoiding confounding bias inherent in RWD. In Aim 1, we develop methods for statistical analysis of RCT data to compare chemoradiotherapy patterns for the real-world and elderly NSCLC patients by leveraging the baseline covariates of comparable patients from SEER, for whom the temporal information of chemotherapy and radiation and the outcome are both missing. Aims 2 and 3 focus on the settings when both RCT and RWD provide comparable covariates, treatment, and outcome information. In Aim 2, we develop improved analysis of RCT data to evaluate trimodality therapy versus surgery alone for the real-world and elderly esophageal cancer patients by exploiting the large sample size and predictive power offered by the NCDB/SEER-Medicare. In Aim 3, we develop new efﬁcient and data-adaptive methods to estimate individualized treatment effects of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation, possibly modiﬁed by age and tumor size, for stage IB resected NSCLC patients by integrating RCT and NCDB data. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is closely in line with the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, which placed additional focus on the use of big real-world data to support decision making and precision medicine. The availability of multiple data sources, namely randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and real-world databases, presents unique and novel opportunities for medical research, because the knowledge that can be acquired from integrative analyses would not be possible from any single-source analysis alone. Our effort is important to bridge RCTs and vast real-world databases and registries arising from clinical practices in order to better understand how treatment works for the real-world and under-studied patient populations outside relatively narrow RCT eligibility criteria and provide accurate and reliable evidence for patient-centered care.",Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data,9947226,R01AG066883,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Medical Research', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'SEER Program', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Target Populations', 'Therapy trial', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'disease registry', 'health economics', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'safety study', 'study population', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2020,409049,-0.031365835895634415
"Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction Project Summary Electronic health records (EHR) provide rich source of data about representative populations and are yet to be fully utilized to enhance clinical decision-making. Conventional approaches in clinical decision-making start with the identification of relevant biomarkers based on subject-matter knowledge, followed by detailed but limited analysis using these biomarkers exclusively. As the current scientific literature indicates, many human disorders share a complex etiological basis and exhibit correlated disease progression. Therefore, it is desirable to use comprehensive patient data for patient similarity. This proposal focuses on deriving a comprehensive and integrated score of patient similarity from complete patient characteristics currently available, including but not limited to 1) demographic similarity; 2) genetic similarity; 3) clinical phenotype similarity; 4) treatment similarity; and 5) exposome similarity (here exposome defined as all available attributes of the living environment an individual is exposed to), when some of the aspects may overlap and interact. We will optimize information fusion and task-dependent feature selection for assessing patient similarity for clinical risk prediction. Since currently there does not exist a pipeline that is able to extract executable complete patient determinant data, to achieve the research goal described above, we propose first deliver an open- source data preparation pipeline that is based on a widely used clinical data standard, the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model (CMD) version 5.2. Moreover, to mitigate common missingness and sparsity challenges in clinical data, we describe the first attempt to represent patients' sparse clinical information with missingness, including diagnosis information, medication data, treatment intervention, with a fixed-length feature vector (i.e. the Patient2Vec). This project has four specific aims. Aim 1 is to develop a clinical data processing pipeline for harmonizing patient information from multiple sources into a standards-based uniformed data representation and to evaluate its efficiency, interoperability, and accuracy. Aim 2 is to leverage a powerful machine learning technique, Document2Vec, from the natural language processing literature, to create an open-source Patient2Vec framework for the derivation of informative numerical representations of patients. Aim 3 is to develop a unified machine learning clinical- outcome-prediction framework for Optimized Patient Similarity Fusion (OptPSF) that integrates traditional medical covariates with the derived numerical patient representations from Patient2Vec (Aim 2) for improved clinical risk prediction. Aim 4 is to evaluate our similarity framework for predicting 1) the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in general EHR patient population and 2) the risk of death among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The project focus on developing a novel data science pipeline which includes a clinical data processing pipeline to format comprehensive patient health determinants from a variety of sources of clinical, genomic, socioenvironmental data, and a clinical-outcome-prediction framework that optimally fuses relevant patient health determinants to define patient similarity for improved clinical risk predictions.",Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction,9870948,R01LM013061,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'feature selection', 'health data', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient health information', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'socioeconomics', 'support tools', 'vector']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,420434,0.0010294713731219588
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9975669,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2020,420833,0.011165026119499545
"Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence Abstract Development of augmented intelligence (AI) models for predicting clinical outcomes is growing exponentially. Automated clinical surveillance to assist in early detection of in-hospital deterioration such as sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) is a promising AI application. As many as 300,000 US hospital patients die each year from problems like sepsis and AKI and 5% or more of these deaths are preventable. Many more patients suffer harm or additional costs as a sequelae to delayed response. Compared to traditional rule-based risk predictions, advanced AI models using methods such as machine learning demonstrate improved reliability of predicting sepsis and AKI. The effectiveness of these systems in practice will likely depend on how AI risk information is integrated into clinical workflow and technologies, yet we are not aware of research to design or evaluate effective in-hospital AI risk information presentation and user interaction. It is widely known that explainable AI is desirable, but what needs to be explained and how to do it effectively and efficiently is not known. There is a need to understand end user perspectives on the value of AI for specific clinical contexts. We will draw on our team's recent research on effective clinical display design, theoretical models of human-AI performance, application of human-AI design principles, and application of human-centered design methods to design and evaluate effective approaches to support timely response to sepsis and AKI risk. Our primary objectives are to: identify factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of AI usefulness, generate design principles for effective health risk surveillance human-AI interaction, and design human-AI user interfaces that meaningfully improve human-AI performance when responding to sepsis and AKI. In Aim 1, we will develop a temporal reasoning AI model for predicting in-hospital development of sepsis and AKI. We will apply this model to retrospective patient data to serve as context for research activities. Using chart review, we will quantify realistic metrics of human-AI system performance that take into account whether the AI model would have predicted deterioration before the clinical team suspected or acted in response to the event. In Aim 2, we will interview clinicians while reviewing temporal progression of a patient's change in condition over their stay, including AI generated risk information. We will gather qualitative data on factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of usefulness of AI information toward the goal of early identification of patient problems. In Aim 3, we will conduct participatory design activities with clinicians to design effective human-centered AI display and interaction to support early response to in-hospital sepsis and AKI. Finally, in Aim 4, using simulated realistic patient care tasks and comparing to traditional patient information technologies, we will evaluate the impact of human-centered AI designs on human-AI performance. We will generate human-AI interaction design guidance for health risk surveillance. Our findings are expected to innovate design for human-AI interaction in electronic health records (EHRs) and health-care monitoring and communication technologies. Narrative As many as 15,000 preventable deaths and many more preventable invasive procedures occur each year in US hospitals due to late detection of unexpected deterioration and emergencies such as cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, sepsis, and bleeding. Advanced approaches to augmented intelligence (AI) through methods such as machine learning may help clinicians to identify and respond to problems early, but little is known about how to effectively present risk information and support interaction between AI and clinicians. The goals of this project are to: identify factors that impact the usefulness of AI, design human-centered AI approaches to reduce harm from late response to sepsis and acute kidney injury, and generate design principles to ensure that AI solutions can be used effectively by clinicians to improve patient care.",Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence,9946956,R01GM137083,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adverse event', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Technology', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Risk', 'Saints', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'simulation', 'skills']",NIGMS,IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,439224,0.017286123321855796
"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers Project Summary Clinicians’ ability to accurately diagnose pneumonia and choose appropriate treatment is enhanced by well- designed clinical decision support (CDS), thereby increasing patient safety. Pneumonia CDS has historically been focused on inpatient settings, but ambulatory care settings with high pneumonia patient volumes and different care processes also need CDS. We propose to adapt and evaluate an innovative, validated electronic clinical decision support (CDS) tool based on consensus guidelines for pneumonia (ePNa) to urgent care centers (UCC). The proposal supports four aims: 1) Adapt ePNa for UCC and after in silico testing, pilot it among “super user” clinicians during UCC shifts and assess its usability. ePNa needs adaptation for the limited patient data available in UCC, calibration of severity measures for lower observed mortality, and a chest imaging prompt in patients with pneumonia signs and symptoms. ePNa for UCC will incorporate the artificial intelligence CheXpert model to provide real-time (within seconds) electronic classification of chest images for elements of pneumonia diagnosis and treatment (radiographic pneumonia, single vs multiple lobes, and pleural effusion). 2) Use the CFIR framework, a focus group of UCC clinicians, and workflow observations to identify barriers and facilitators to adaptation and implementation of ePNa to UCC. 3) Test the implementation strategy by deploying ePNa at one of two randomly chosen Intermountain Healthcare UCC clusters each with about 800 annual pneumonia patients - the other a usual care control. 4) Co-primary outcomes are a) Patients diagnosed with pneumonia without chest imaging will be ≥50% lower in the ePNa cluster. b) Antibiotic prescribing for treatment of pneumonia will be ≥90% consistent with consensus guidelines and higher in the ePNa cluster. Safety measures will be unplanned subsequent 7-day ED visits/hospitalizations and 30-day mortality. Based on this rigorous pilot study, we anticipate a subsequent multi-system cluster-randomized trial including Cerner systems outside Utah. Our work incorporates the Five Rights of CDS to ensure that the strengths of this technology are optimized in the clinical environment. We will leverage experience in innovative pneumonia research, pioneering CDS, and implementation science available at Intermountain to successfully complete this proposal. The proposal will be facilitated by and disseminated through Intermountain relationships with the PCORnet Learning Health Systems Network, PCOR CDS Learning Network, the Healthcare Services Platform Consortium, Cerner, and clinicaltrials.gov. Our innovative proposal promises to advance safety for patients suspected of pneumonia in an understudied, high-volume ambulatory care setting. Project Narrative Pneumonia is the most common serious infection among adults, but diagnosis and treatment decisions vary between different clinicians. We will adapt for free standing urgent care clinics a validated, real-time, emergency department deployed, electronic pneumonia clinical decision support tool (ePNa). We hypothesize successful implementation of ePNa using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research into a cluster of urgent care clinics which treat about 800 pneumonia patients annually will improve care processes and patient outcomes compared to a similar cluster of usual care clinics.","Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers",9932165,R18HS026886,[' '],AHRQ,"IHC HEALTH SERVICES, INC.",R18,2020,443454,0.019209687823497898
"Enabling of a wireless and remotely monitored bi-ventricular pacing device through the internet of medical things for heart failure patients Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless bidirectional real-time communication and powering of a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) biventricular pacemaker with integrated ventricular pressure sensors. Heart failure (HF) has become a challenge of epidemic proportions to the healthcare system in the United States with poor prognosis for patients and elevated healthcare costs. Cardiac resynchronization therapy and home monitoring of vascular pressure through implantable wireless devices have shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce hospitalization of heart failure patients. None of the current solutions connect CRT treatment to remote monitoring due to limitations of wireless interconnected devices within the body. Bionet’s software-defined UsWB proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly higher than radio frequency (RF) waves and with greater reliability. The Bionet platform includes: i) 2 Reprogrammable wireless pacing nodes coupled to MEMS pressure sensors; ii) Rechargeable system controller to coordinate with, recharge, and reprogram other implantable elements of the network through the ultrasonic interface; iii) External recharging and communication patch to act as a power/data gateway to interconnect the intra-body network with the Internet. An intelligent CRT device that can be remotely monitored by clinicians in order to optimize therapy using continuous real-time data will lead to improved HF treatment options and informed treatment decisions individualized for each patient (point-of-care). In this Phase I study, feasibility for wireless power and remote monitoring with the Bionet system will be demonstrated by completing the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate in vitro feasibility of controlled pacing, recharging, and pressure sensing elements using ultrasounds at typical implantable tissue depths. Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate in vivo data and energy transmission for the system, allowing for controlled cardiac pacing using real time blood pressure data. In vivo experiments in porcine models (n=4) will be used to demonstrate the ability of the system to transmit data and energy from the subcutaneous controller to the pacing nodes and acquire real time intraventricular pressure data. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet and the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet’s system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care.

"Machine Learning to Optimize Management of Acute Hydrocephalus Patients 37,000 patients a year receive an external ventricular drain (EVD) in the setting of acute hydrocephalus in the US, generating in-hospital charges of $151,672 per patient, or $5.6 billion dollars a year. There is great motivation in the neurointensive care unit for the optimization of EVD management to reduce infection rates, accurately determine need for permanent shunting, and to do so efficiently in order to minimize duration of drainage and length of stay (LOS). Risk factors for ventriculitis include EVD duration, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling frequency, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and insertion technique. Severe CSF disturbances in patients with IVH and EVDs limit the value of routine CSF analysis for ventriculitis prediction. And ventriculitis diagnosis is imprecise, with only a minority declaring culture positivity while all still demanding antibiotic treatment and delay of permanent shunt. This leads to unnecessary empiric antibiotic treatment and increased LOS (30.8 vs 22.6 days), with the associated cost ($30,335 more) and morbidity (e.g. Clostridium difficile infection, emergence of drug-resistant pathology). The process of determining permanent shunt dependence is variable between institutions, particularly around the decision of when to begin weaning the EVD or predicting delayed resolution. These decisions in the subacute period determine LOS and associated adverse events, exposure to radiography, and commitment to potentially unnecessary permanent foreign materials in the CNS, which then carry lifelong risks for infection and blockage. There is no accurate noninvasive test (that does not further introduce infection) to diagnose ventriculitis nor is there a timely method to predict need for permanent shunt after acute hydrocephalus. To fill this gap, we propose developing a quantitative model from intracranial pressure (ICP) waveform analysis to increase precision in the diagnosis of ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt. In previous work, we were able to predict with good accuracy who would need permanent shunt placement using ICP waveform analysis collected during a 24 hour clamp trial. However, a complex model can only be justified if it achieves a diagnosis earlier or more accurately than traditional clinical methods. In preliminary work, we clustered raw ICP waveforms and found a pattern of waveforms specific for ventriculitis that appears 1 day before diagnostic cultures are sent. Our central hypothesis is that there is a temporal quantitative signal in ICP waveform reflective of intracranial dynamics that can be harvested to optimize acute hydrocephalus management. Impact and Significance: Noninvasive quantitative models based on ICP waveform analysis that diagnose ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt would decrease the duration of EVD and the frequency of CSF sampling, two of the risk factors for ventriculitis, while also decreasing LOS, associated adverse events of ICU stay, and empiric antibiotics. There is no accurate noninvasive test to diagnose ventriculitis nor is there a timely method to predict need for permanent shunt after acute hydrocephalus. To fill this gap, we propose developing a quantitative model from intracranial pressure waveform analysis to increase precision in the diagnosis of ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt. Accurate noninvasive sequential machine learning models could decrease external ventricular drain duration and cerebrospinal fluid sampling frequency, two of the risk factors for ventriculitis, while also decreasing length of stay and empiric systemic antibiotics.",Machine Learning to Optimize Management of Acute Hydrocephalus Patients,10057040,R21NS113055,"['Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Caring', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Closure by clamp', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Drainage procedure', 'Drug resistance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Harvest', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Charges', 'Hour', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institution', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Ventricular', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'improved', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'intraventricular hemorrhage', 'long short term memory', 'recurrent neural network', 'vector']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2020,445500,0.010079825953209567
"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9879630,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,454065,0.015321784751949518
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia,9850564,R01DC013063,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cathodes', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Love', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug discovery', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'forgetting', 'frontal lobe', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'gaze', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sound', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'supervised learning', 'treatment services', 'voltage']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2020,466715,-0.0304571871639391
"Wireless ultrasonic powering and monitoring of Left Ventricular Assist Devices through the Internet of Medical Things Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless powering and bidirectional real-time communication of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Heart failure (HF) has become a challenge of epidemic proportions to the healthcare system in the United States with poor prognosis for patients and elevated healthcare costs. LVADs are standard surgical therapy for advanced HF patients refractory to medical management. Despite extensive training and daily care, LVAD recipients still experience driveline infections (14-28%) at an annual cost of $20,000 and represents a clinically- significant adverse event and one of the primary causes of death. Transcutaneous energy transmission systems (TETS) are being developed to eliminate the LVAD’s driveline. Currently, TETS technology is limited by (1) low energy transfer efficiency, (2) power loss due to coil misalignment, (3) reduced data transmission rates with increasing depth of penetration, and (4) heating of tissue. Bionet Sonar’s software-defined ultrasonic wide band (UsWB) proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly greater than RF waves and with greater reliability. Since increasing energy efficiency results in reduced energy storage requirements UsWB also enables reduction in size of implantable technologies. Bionet’s UsWB TETS (UTET) system includes: (1) energy transfer portal with internal and external intelligent piezo array-surfaces, (2) implantable controller with energy storage capacity, (3) external controller with IoMT portal, and (4) wearable power supply. These elements will enable wireless LVAD operation over wide range of clinical conditions with real-time data acquisition and diagnostics. Proof-of-concept for Bionet’s core technology was tested in vitro, demonstrating superior data transmission compared to RF (700kHz, 180kbit/s, 20cm tissue depth) and ultrasonic wireless recharging. In this Phase I study, feasibility of the fully-integrated wireless, UTET system for LVAD support will be demonstrated by completing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Design and fabricate fully-integrated UTET system and demonstrate feasibility with clinical- grade LVAD in an in vitro model that mimics clinically-relevant implantable tissue depths and geometries. Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate feasibility of the fully-integrated UTET system with clinical-grade LVAD in an acute bovine model (n=2) at flow rates of 1-5 L/min for up to 8 hours. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet and the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet’s UTET system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care. Project Narrative Through this proposal a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless powering and bidirectional real-time communication of a ventricular assist device will be developed. Ultrasound wideband technology will be used to create a system that doesn’t require a trans-cutaneous driveline to control and energize the pump of a ventricular assist device, thus, eliminating drive-line infections and improving quality of life of heart failure patients. This technology will not only improve patient outcomes and healthcare economics of this patient population, but may also enable other innovative therapies in other populations.",Wireless ultrasonic powering and monitoring of Left Ventricular Assist Devices through the Internet of Medical Things,10007683,R43HL152767,"['Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Bluetooth', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cattle', 'Cause of Death', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Energy Transfer', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Heating', 'Hour', 'Implant', 'Infection', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Power Sources', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonic wave', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Wireless Technology', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data exchange', 'design', 'experience', 'frontier', 'health care economics', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vitro testing', 'innovation', 'left ventricular assist device', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'pre-clinical', 'pressure', 'product development', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'software development', 'sonar', 'subcutaneous', 'transmission process', 'ventricular assist device', 'verification and validation', 'wireless communication']",NHLBI,BIONET SONAR,R43,2020,468992,0.004364339029426604
"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.

"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,10020962,R01HS027369,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,496734,0.009473454425930792
"Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care This proposal presents innovations to addressing teen depression during routine check-up visits through further development of an online clinical process support system called CHADIS. The primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for other teen challenges might also be promising. Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the past year. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive necessary care. This proposal addresses the significant public health problem of teen depression through use of a comprehensive, process-driven intervention targeting time points before, during, and after routine visits with primary care providers (PCPs) through a new module to an online clinical process support system called CHADIS.",Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care,10019727,R44MH116751,"['17 year old', 'Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Moods', 'Office Visits', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Qualitative Research', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Specialist', 'Specialty Boards', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'chatbot', 'checkup examination', 'child depression', 'control trial', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'programs', 'recruit', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'shared decision making', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'skills', 'success', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2020,502902,0.009557925440163276
"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,10003227,R01DK116986,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'base', 'case-based', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'design', 'feature selection', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injury prevention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'prevent']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,506170,0.0039564846957811164
"Buprenorphine Effect on Suicidal Behavior Mortality and morbidity related to suicidal behavior and opioid use disorder (OUD) have increased significantly over the past decade. These two public health crises are intertwined at multiple levels.  Medications for OUD, especially buprenorphine, have the potential to decrease illicit opioid use and reduce the multiple negative consequences of OUD, including fatal and nonfatal overdose, criminal justice involvement, infectious complications, and misuse of other substances. In addition, several small randomized trials of buprenorphine treatment in treatment-resistant depression (with or without co-occurring OUD) suggest that buprenorphine may reduce depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. No conceivable randomized trial, however, would be large enough to assess effects of buprenorphine on suicidal behavior.  Consequently, we propose a large observational study to evaluate the effects of initiating buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicidal behavior among people with OUD, including those with and without co- occurring mental health conditions or other known risk factors for suicidal behavior. We propose to assemble data from four MHRN health systems serving a combined member/patient population of approximately 11 million. This work will take advantage of methods successfully implemented in previous MHRN research and research by our HCSRN Addictions Research Network.  Valid causal inference will require appropriate methods to account for confounding by indication (i.e. people with OUD treated with buprenorphine have higher or lower pre-existing risk of suicidal behavior than people not treated with buprenorphine). Choice of the optimal method will depend on patterns observed in actual data (e.g. rates and correlates of buprenorphine use), but we anticipate considering the following: • Propensity-score matching using machine learning-derived propensity scores • Propensity-score weighting using machine learning-derived propensity scores • Disease risk score adjustment using machine learning-derived suicide risk prediction scores Using this data resource and these analytic methods, we will address the following specific questions: 1) Overall effect: Among people with recognized OUD, how does initiation of buprenorphine treatment affect  risk of suicidal behavior over the following 90 days compared to risk among otherwise similar people with  OUD not initiating buprenorphine treatment? 2) Heterogeneity of effect: Does any effect of initiating buprenorphine vary according to:  a. Means or mechanism of suicidal behavior (opioid overdose vs. other overdose vs. self-injury)?  b. Presence/absence of co-occurring mood disorder or severe mental illness? 3) Specificity of effect: Are effects observed for buprenorphine also observed for alternative medications for treatment of OUD (e.g. naltrexone)? This large observational study will evaluate the effects of initiating buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicidal behavior among people with opioid use disorder, including those with and without co-occurring mental health conditions or other known risk factors for suicidal behavior. We will use comprehensive health records data from four large health systems serving a combined member/patient population of approximately 11 million. Analyses will examine overall effect of buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicide attempt or death, heterogeneity of effects in patient subgroups, and specificity of effects to buprenorphine vs other medications.",Buprenorphine Effect on Suicidal Behavior,10136935,U19MH121738,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Buprenorphine', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Naltrexone', 'Observational Study', 'Overdose', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Specificity', 'Suicide attempt', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Translations', 'Weight', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'World Health', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'buprenorphine treatment', 'chronic pain', 'data resource', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'health record', 'high risk', 'illicit opioid', 'member', 'mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid tapering', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'population based', 'prescription opioid', 'randomized trial', 'risk prediction model', 'severe mental illness', 'social factors', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment-resistant depression']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U19,2020,514616,-0.08269980028372646
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9997993,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'comorbidity', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support vector machine', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2020,515780,-0.018790341596653038
"Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy PROJECT SUMMARY The era of “big data” has opened the door for genomic and systems biology approaches to be applied to current challenges in life sciences and precision medicine. One critical challenge in these areas is how to prioritize research findings to validate and identify actionable insights that can translate into better outcomes for patients. In this regard, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group of scientists and physicians from academia and industry with a focus on creating discovery pipelines that combine high-throughput profiling technologies with advanced statistical and machine learning approaches to generate predictive tools that enable us to move rapidly from big data to better diagnoses and treatment. In this regard, we propose to apply these approaches to develop a computational clinical decision tool that will improve disease forecasting and treatment plans for Multiple Myeloma (MM), an incurable cancer that originates in bone marrow plasma cells and affects more than 30,000 patients a year. Though there have been some advances in the number and diversity of available therapeutic options for these patients, relapse remains inevitable, and MM ultimately remains a terminal diagnosis. The clinical assay and computational pipeline developed in this project will combine a targeted sequencing panel specific to myeloma patients and clonality estimates with RNA- sequencing and drug repurposing to expand therapeutic options for MM patients. We will develop this unique tool with the following specific aims: (1) Develop an integrated genomic clinical decision tool to guide precision treatment of MM and validate therapy recommendations using PDX profiling, and (2) Validate MM precision medicine platform in a prospective clinical trial and generate clone-specific treatment recommendations. To achieve these objectives, we will integrate a Cancer Genetic, Inc.'s FOCUS::Myeloma panel, a targeted panel designed to specifically interrogateall the genes and copy number alterations commonly altered in myeloma, and into a computational drug selection pipeline that utilizes RNA-sequencing data and drug repurposing algorithms to generate therapeutic recommendations matched to a patient's unique disease profile. These recommendations will be validated in mouse avatars of myeloma to confirm and refine drug predictions. We will implement our assay in a prospective clinical trial of 100 patients to determine if the treatment decisions generated by our pipeline achieves an improvement in standard-of-care. Finally, we will perform clonal modeling on relapsed patients to retrospectively evaluate clone-specific treatment responses. Completion of these studies will result in a clinic-ready assay and computational tool that will guide MM precision treatment decisions and inform new therapeutic strategies based on a patient's unique cancer profile. genomic clonal modeling PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple Myeloma is an incurable cancer of the blood that takes the lives of over 12,000 people every year. It remains a difficult disease to treat due to its genetic complexity from the earliest stages of the disease, indicating a need for a precision medicine approach in treating these patients. In this application Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai will partner with Cancer Genetics, Inc. to develop a multi-omics clinical decision assay that will improve long-term outcomes for patients with advanced myeloma and generate valuable insights and tools that can be broadly leveraged for other disease indications.",Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy,9981389,R01CA244899,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Bone Marrow', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonality', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Employment', 'Event', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Industry', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Intestines', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mus', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'RNA', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stream', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'cancer genetics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'efficacy testing', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'pilot trial', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'relapse patients', 'standard of care', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,519735,-0.03444033922150693
"Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data It is a common clinical occurrence that neuroimaging scans obtained in the course of routine clinical care discover a prior brain infarction in patients with no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Indeed, epidemiologic studies indicate that silent brain infarctions (SBI) are far more common than strokes; MRI- defined SBI can be detected in ~20% of the healthy elderly. In these studies based on screened patients, the findings have been shown to be associated with subtle, typically unrecognized, deficits in physical and cognitive function. These imaging findings are also strong, independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. Despite the very high prevalence of SBI in screened populations, and their serious consequences, little is known about the significance or the appropriate management of SBI when discovered incidentally in routine care. While there is strong evidence that antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy are effective in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke, the degree to which these results apply to patients with SBI is unclear. Because patients with SBI define a population that falls in between primary and secondary stroke prevention, the approach to these patients is marked by uncertainty and practice variation, making it an ideal condition for observational comparative effectiveness research. Nonetheless, there are serious challenges for the study of SBI. As patients have no overt symptoms, recruitment into a trial can be problematic. Comparative effectiveness research on SBI, using routinely collected data and leveraging the variation in care of these patients, is impeded by the fact that there are no ICD codes for SBI, and it is generally not included in structured fields of electronic health records (EHR) as it is typically considered an incidental finding. In order to establish the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for SBI in a large, heterogeneous population, we propose to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to identify individuals with SBI through the automated review of neuroradiology reports. We have performed preliminary work to demonstrate that such an approach is feasible. We will then apply state-of-the-science observational comparative effectiveness methods in a massive database with linked EHR and claims data to examine the effectiveness of statins and antiplatelet agents in preventing future stroke and dementia. Thus, our aims are: Aim 1: We will develop NLP algorithms that can accurately identify cases of SBI and white matter disease (WMD) in two different health systems. Aim 2: We will port, refine, and validate the NLP algorithm in a large heterogeneous database including more than 600 hospitals and 6500 clinics and identify a large cohort of patients with routinely-discovered SBI and WMD. Aim 3: We will characterize the cohort with respect to age- specific prevalence of SBI, management patterns, and the risk of future stroke and dementia associated with SBI and WMD. Aim 4: We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of preventive therapies (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally-discovered SBI. The goal of this project is to improve the evidence base for the prevention of stroke in patients with “silent brain infarct”—i.e., a stroke on neuroimaging (head CT or MRI) but no clinical evidence of a stroke. We will develop a computer-based algorithm using a technology known as natural language processing that can accurately identify cases of silent brain infarction among a large population of adults on whom neuroimages have been obtained, but who are without a history of clinically-evident cerebrovascular disease. We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of medications (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally discovered and reported SBI.",Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data,9931326,R01NS102233,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'American Stroke Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Infarction', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'repository', 'routine care', 'screening', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,520509,0.020356194093649412
"Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark's population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation.

"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) are debilitating conditions affecting more than 5 million Americans in 2014. It is projected that 8.4 million people with be diagnosed with ADRD over the next 15 years and health care costs attributable to ADRD are projected to be more than $1.2 trillion by 2050. Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are common and often involve aggressive behavior towards family caregivers (CG) in response to unmet needs, discomfort, or frustration. BPSD frequently lead to CG seeking medication to control patient symptoms. Antipsychotic use in persons with dementia (PWD) more than doubles mortality risk. The Choosing Wisely Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics Society both recommend against prescribing antipsychotics as a first-line treatment for BPSD. Behavioral interventions such as STAR-Caregivers are efficacious first-line treatments for managing BPSD endorsed by the Administration on Aging. However, the programs have not been implemented widely – partly due to the intensity/cost of the programs and difficulty conducting outreach. No study has investigated CG willingness to reduce or discontinue antipsychotic use. We propose a Stage III clinical trial to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of STAR Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR- VTF) in which (a) training materials are delivered electronically and learning is self-directed, (b) caregivers have two in-home visits with a social worker and (c) where caregivers receive support from a social worker via secure messaging (email) within a web-based portal. We will compare outcomes in the STAR-VTF group to an attention control group (mailed material plus generic secure messages). Our specific aims are: (1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of STAR-VTF to caregivers; (2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program from the payer perspective; and (3) Test the hypotheses that (H1) caregiver participants in STAR-VTF will have lower levels of caregiver burden at 8 weeks and 6 months compared to an attention control group; and (H2) PWD participants in STAR-VTF will have lower rates of daily antipsychotic medication use at 6 months compared to attention control. We propose to recruit 100 CG-PWD dyads (50 in each arm). This will be the first study to test a low intensity, self-directed caregiver training program with secure message support from social workers. It will also be the first study to measure changes in antipsychotic medication use by PWD after CG training. The study is also innovative because it brings together leading experts in caregiver training, health information management, and care management. Third, this will be the first study to use automated data and natural language processing to identify potential caregivers in need of education/support at a time when antipsychotic medication use begins. Results of this study will inform a future multi-site trial in the Mental Health Research Network. NARRATIVE Our study evaluates the effectiveness of a caregiver outreach, training, and support program for caregivers of people with dementia who are using antipsychotic medication to manage agitation/aggression. We will conduct a randomized trial of the caregiver program compared to a control group to measure differences in caregiver burden and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication use. The results will help in expanding access to and delivery of empirically supported behavioral health services for caregivers and people with dementia.",STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up,9930511,R01AG061926,"['Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'American Psychiatric Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'E-learning', 'Education', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Family Caregiver', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Improve Access', 'Information Management', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Program Acceptability', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Site', 'Social Workers', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'Travel', 'Washington', 'arm', 'attentional control', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'caregiver depression', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multi-site trial', 'outreach', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'program costs', 'programs', 'psychological symptom', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'response', 'retiree', 'secondary outcome', 'time use', 'urgent care', 'virtual', 'web portal', 'willingness']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,531691,0.00268495476828268
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,9839684,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,532467,0.0019780326105214466
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9910440,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical predictors', 'comorbidity', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'stroke risk', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,535600,0.018086127110272358
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9896876,R01NS097000,"['Address', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Labyrinthine disorder', 'Leukocytes', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cohort', 'emergency settings', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'mRNA Expression', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'platelet function', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'release factor', 'stroke risk', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,544777,0.01907081065555598
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9869872,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'comparison intervention', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'nonmedical use', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,547843,-0.02247147373551552
"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk Abstract About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over $130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff & nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense, patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced, human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients, avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed hospital.

"A Cognitive Risk Calculator and Screening tool for Primary Care Settings PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The number of people with Alzheimer’s disease is expected to exceed 88 million by 2050. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders symptoms are imperative for efforts to develop disease modifying therapies or interventions, and are important for optimal patient care. The objective of this proposal is to provide an accurate, feasible, and low-cost process to facilitate cognitive screening in population health. The aims of the R61 project are to develop and validate two complementary, automated tools to identify and screen patients at high risk for cognitive decline. The first is a risk calculator that uses routine clinical data to estimate patients’ risk for cognitive decline. Patients 60 years and older will undergo formal cognitive testing, and five prior years of routinely-collected electronic health record data will be used to model cognitive status. The Cognitive Risk Calculator will be validated in two historical samples and integrated into the electronic medical record to help providers identify vulnerable patients. The second tool is a validated iPad-based screening tool, the Brief Assessment of Cognitive Health (BACH) that patients can complete independently before, during, or after their doctor appointment. Patients will complete the BACH, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (a paper-and-pencil screening tool), and formal neuropsychological testing at two time points. We hypothesize the BACH will be more sensitive to cognitive change over time than the established screening tool. The BACH is already integrated into the Epic electronic medical record platform; cognitive score and screening results for depression, stress, and sleep disruption are automatically recorded in the patient’s medical record for providers to document and act upon. The R33 project is a Phase IV pragmatic clinical trial to gauge the uptake and utility of these tools in primary care practices. Six internal medicine clinics will be randomized over time to the active study arm (Risk Calculator and BACH). This will permit comparisons of standard of care screening practices with screening activities following introduction of the Cognitive Risk Calculator and BACH. We will use a mixed-methods approach to determine optimal implementation strategies across a variety of practice models. Impact: The EHR risk-calculator and BACH have the capacity to improve detection of cognitive decline on a population health scale. The project also examines how regional differences in socioeconomic advantage relate to health disparities measured in terms of cognitive risk as well as screening attitudes and behaviors on the part of both providers and patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Population health protocols lack efficient and effective methods to screen cognitive health.

"A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice Abstract With growing interest in personalized medicine and the rise of machine learning, constructing good risk prediction and prognostic models has been drawing renewed attention. In this development, much effort is concentrated in identifying good predictors of patient outcomes, although the same level of rigor is often absent in improving the outcome side of prediction. The majority of popular supervised techniques (e.g., regularized logistic regression and its variations), which can be readily applied in risk model development, assumes that the prediction target is a clear single outcome measured at a single time point. In clinical reality, patient outcomes are often complex, multivariate, and measured with errors. Even when a target is a relatively clear univariate outcome (e.g., death, cancer, diabetes, etc), the process that leads to this ultimate outcome often involves complex intermediate outcomes, where predicting and understanding this intermediate process can be crucial in providing effective care and preventing negative ultimate outcomes. The situation calls for a ﬂexible learning framework that can easily incorporate this important but neglected aspect in model development - better characterizing and constructing prediction targets before building prediction models.  Focusing on risk labels as prediction targets, we propose a pragmatic 3-stage learning approach, where we sequentially 1) generate latent labels, 2) validate them using explicit validators, and 3) go on with supervised learning with labeled data. Latent variable (LV) strategies used in Satge 1 have great potentials in handling complex outcome information. The unsupervised nature of LV strategies makes highly ﬂexible data synthesis and organization possible. The same nature, however, can also be seen as esoteric and subjective, which is not desirable in situations where transparency and reproducibility are of great concern such as in risk prediction. As a practical solution to this problem, we propose the use of explicit clinical validators, which not only makes LV-based labels closely aligned with contemporary science and clinical practice, but also makes it possible to automatically validate and narrow a large pool of candidate labels. With the goal of developing a practical and transparent system of learning and inference for clinical research and practice, we formed a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in latent variable modeling, machine learning, psychometrics and causal inference along with clinical/substantive expertise. Our streamlined learning framework focuses on direct and transparent validation of latent variable solutions to ensure clear communication across risk model developers, clinical researchers and practitioners. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction. Narrative This project intends to develop a pragmatic learning and risk predction framework that will facilitate utilization of multivariate data collected from research and health care services, which otherwise is underutilized in developing methods to improve personalized care of future patients. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction, and therefore will have positive impact on public health.",A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice,10033908,R01MH123443,"['Address', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Intention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'data exploration', 'flexibility', 'health care service', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'model development', 'neglect', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction model', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,565519,0.005391208938467268
"5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Summary Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion. Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study (NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority. This project will answer the preliminary questions necessary for a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods, that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview- based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,9984613,R01MH120089,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'metropolitan', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,572946,-0.003230138056354607
"Factors associated with hospitalization, ICU use and death among vulnerable populations diagnosed with COVID-19 Project Summary. As of April 30, 2020, over 1 million individuals in the U.S. have been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with COVID-19 may develop various symptoms – while the majority of patients have mild symptoms, some require hospitalization, admissions to intensive care unit (ICU), and may die. To date, there is only limited knowledge on risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19. First, older adults have been found to have higher risks of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are more likely to be hospitalized or die. Studies have suggested that some underlying conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, or obesity, are associated with the severity of COVID-19. However, it is unknown to what extent these comorbidities explain the variation in the severity of COVID-19, whether older age is independently associated with the severity of COVID-19; and whether and how older age modifies the relationship between comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19. Second, it has been reported that black Americans experienced a higher rate of COVID-related hospitalization and were more likely to die of COVID- 19, compared to white Americans. However, it is unknown what may contribute to such racial difference – whether it is due to the differences in health conditions between blacks and whites, or due to the characteristics of the community where they reside in, or due to some other factors that are also associated with race. The objective of this study is to identify individual risk factors that are associated with the severity of COVID-19 (i.e. hospitalizations, ICU use and death), especially among older adults, and to understand reasons that may contribute to racial differences in COVID-19 severity. To achieve these goals, we will use the daily- updated national Veterans Affairs (VA) data, which contain rich individual-level information on veterans diagnosed with COVID-19. As of April 30, 2020, almost 9,000 veterans have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and about 500 had died, thus providing a large study cohort. This proposed study has two Specific Aims:1) To identify individual risk factors that are associated with COVID-19 related hospitalizations, ICU use and mortality, to understand the role of older age in COVID-19 severity, and to build a predictive model for COVID- 19 severity by machine learning; and 2) To examine reasons for racial differences in illness severity among veterans diagnosed with COVID-19: whether and how such difference is related to individual factors and community characteristics, especially socio-economic status. This study is innovative because it will be the first study to examine the role of multiple risk factors in the severity of COVID-19 by using national data with detailed individual-level information and machine learning algorithm; and it will be the first to examine the reasons, including the role of social determinants, for racial differences in COVID-19 severity. This proposed research is significant as it will help to identify patients with the highest-risk phenotypes, thus providing insights into disease prevention and resource allocation. Project Narrative: This proposed research aims to understand risks factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 (i.e. hospitalization, ICU use and death) and the role of older age in the severity of COVID-19; and to examine reasons leading to racial differences in the severity of COVID-19. This proposed research is highly relevant to public health because the findings from this study will help target prevention strategies and allocation of resources to high-risk populations and help fight this novel infectious disease.","Factors associated with hospitalization, ICU use and death among vulnerable populations diagnosed with COVID-19",10159581,RF1AG063811,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'African American', 'Age', 'COVID-19', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Virus', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'caucasian American', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'fighting', 'health administration', 'health difference', 'health service use', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel virus', 'parent grant', 'predictive modeling', 'racial difference', 'racial health disparity', 'social determinants', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'study population', 'success']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,RF1,2020,578879,-0.0013990011913143756
"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10010769,R44EY031202,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Antioxidants', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drusen', 'Ear', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fees', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Java', 'Lasers', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'New York', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sales', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Sun Exposure', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trademark', 'Treatment Cost', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Acuity', 'Vitamins', 'age related', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care costs', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'photobiomodulation', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'retinal imaging', 'rural area', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2020,585067,-0.03114497706683845
"An Electronic Health Record-Based Tool to Identify Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients at Risk of Low Social Support ABSTRACT Social support, a social determinant of health (SDoH), is a definitive predictor of breast cancer (BC) treatment and mortality outcomes. Because of the recognition that social support is critical to BC patient outcomes, clinicians within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) have documented information on social support in the electronic health record (EHR) since the advent of Epic in 2005. However, no EHR-based social support measure currently exists to help clinicians identify patients at high risk of low social support. Such a measure has high relevance for addressing racial/ethnic disparities in BC treatment and outcomes. Therefore, we propose to develop an Electronic Health Record Social Support Patient Risk Tool (EHR-SUPPORT) that could be used to identify women with BC at risk of low social support for referral to social support resources. We propose to: 1) Identify terms in the EHR, based on theory and prior literature, and informed by KPNC stakeholders in BC care, that reflect structural and/or functional social support, and have been associated with BC treatment and outcomes; 2) Develop EHR-SUPPORT, using structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (to include natural language processing of text) that identifies patients at risk of low social support, overall and by race/ethnicity, and validate the measure against published social support measures; and 3) Evaluate associations of EHR-SUPPORT and its component variables with BC treatment (surgery and chemotherapy delays, nonadherence to hormonal therapy) and BC-specific and total mortality, overall and by race/ethnicity in 44,348 women diagnosed with stage I-IV BC within Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 2006- 2023 including 3,450 Black, 4,441 Hispanic, 6,571 Asian women, and 28,589 non-Latina white women. In an exploratory aim, we will develop, with KP clinician stakeholders, steps to the implementation of EHR- SUPPORT. We will review 100 medical records (25 in each race/ethnic group) within two months of diagnosis, informed by investigator expertise and clinician stakeholders, to develop terms used to describe patient support. In addition to developing structured data, we will use natural language processing of text fields to further develop social support indicators (Aim 1). EHR-SUPPORT will be computed from social support indicators; we will use linear and logistic regression to validate the developed measure against established social support measures in Pathways, a well-established cohort of 4,505 women with BC and use factor analytic and confirmatory factor analytic methods as well as ROC curves to further evaluate the score (Aim 2). We will use linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate associations in Aim 3. The unique convergence of EHR and cohort data provides the first opportunity to develop and validate an EHR- based social support measure in in diverse women with BC, adjusted for an extensive set of covariates. This work is central to identifying patients at elevated risk of low social support and to enhancing social support- cancer research needed to improve clinical care and reduce BC disparities. NARRATIVE Social support, a social determinant of health (SDoH), is a definitive predictor of breast cancer (BC) treatment and mortality outcomes and is critical to racial/ethnic disparities in breast cancer (BC) treatment and mortality outcomes.

"1/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of ProdromE Risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers.

In an exploratory ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains. This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative  Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",1/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of ProdromE Risk,9975396,R01MH120090,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2020,589572,-0.005152924924065606
"A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) is expected to triple by 2050, contributing to decreased quality of life, increased medical care utilization, and additional burden on an already stressed primary care system. Many clinicians lack confidence to assess, diagnose and manage cognitive impairment (CI), and more than 50% of patients with CI are undiagnosed. Unfortunately, studies show that even in settings with high rates of standardized CI screening, very few patients who screen positive have documentation of any clinician follow-up action. To address these important problems, in phase 1 (R61) of this project, we will develop and validate a machine learning model (called MC-PLUS) using results from brief Mini- Cog (MC) screens completed routinely at Annual Medicare Wellness exams and electronic health record (EHR) data to identify patients at elevated risk of a future dementia diagnosis (AD/ADRD). We will also develop and validate a web-based and EHR-integrated CI clinical decision support (CI-CDS) system to engage patients and clinicians in conversation about elevated dementia risk, and to give clinicians the confidence and tools they need to diagnose and manage CI. Both MC-PLUS and the CI-CDS system will be added into an existing web-based CDS platform that has high use rates and primary care clinician satisfaction, and is already seamlessly integrated within the EHR. This CDS platform improves outcomes for patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and high cardiovascular risk as shown in published studies. We will systematically validate the CI-CDS system with expert champions prior to conducting a pilot test at one primary care clinic. After milestones for success are demonstrated, we will begin phase 2 (R33), a large pragmatic trial with 30 primary care clinics randomized to receive CI-CDS or usual care (UC). We will evaluate change in clinician confidence in CI detection and care management in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. If successful, the CI-CDS system will improve rates of new CI diagnosis and narrow existing sociodemographic disparities in adults with elevated dementia risk identified by MC-PLUS at index visit in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. We will evaluate the impact of the intervention on care management and care plans using EHR data and chart audits. We will assess determinants of clinician actions in response to the CDS system using behavior change theory and technology acceptance constructs, and conduct phone surveys of patient and caregiver dyads to evaluate intervention effects on feelings of preparedness for decision making and distress. The CI-CDS system is immediately scalable to large numbers of patients through the existing non-commercialized CDS platform already in use for millions of patients in care systems spanning 14 states. The CDS system implemented as described could maximize return on massive investments that have been made in EHR systems, and provide a prototype to rapidly and consistently translate evolving evidence-based CI guidelines into personalized CI care and guidance within primary care. Project Narrative Most experts advocate for early detection of cognitive impairment (CI) so that patients and caregivers can be prepared for making difficult decisions and to improve quality of life, but studies show that screening alone isn’t sufficient to change clinician actions related to early detection. Using predictive modelling developed with machine learning methods and sophisticated clinical decision support (CDS) tools, it is possible to identify patients at elevated risk for CI and make it much easier for primary care to engage and support patients and caregivers in meaningful care planning. In this project, we implement and evaluate a low-cost, highly scalable CI-CDS system integrated within the electronic health record that has high potential to improve early CI detection and care and translate massive public and private sector investments in health informatics into tangible health benefits for large numbers of people.",A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment,10092423,R61AG069770,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Expenditures', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Office Visits', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Printing', 'Private Sector', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Suggestion', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Theory of Change', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care systems', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'personalized care', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual']",NIA,HEALTHPARTNERS INSTITUTE,R61,2020,592048,-0.005649461662281454
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9869048,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data Methods', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,595773,0.028666112330687506
"Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is a challenge our society must address. While the future of healthcare availability and quality of services seems uncertain, at the same time advances in pervasive computing and intelligent embedded systems provides innovative strategies to meet these needs. One particular need which technology can help address is assessment and assistance with a person's functional performance. The long-term goal of this work is to develop technologies that will improve the independent functioning and quality of life of individuals with functional limitations (particularly individuals with ADRDs) and reduce their reliance on caregivers. The primary objective of this application is to develop a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and assistance with everyday activities. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach will be to collect and fuse multi-modal functional performance data from ambient sensors, mobile sensors, free text, and assessment apps (Aim 1). This fused “human behaviorome” will provide a basis, together with observation-based ground truth, for automated functional assessment and validation of each component technology, including the use of compensatory strategies, through in-person observation and through video recording of typical daily activities and strategies (Aim 2). Finally, using iterative, user-centered assessment of prompt-based assistance, we will evaluate the ability of activity segmentation and forecasting techniques to provide automated support for activity initiation and accurate completion of everyday activities (Aim 3). The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on functional health revealed within a person's everyday environment that have not been investigated in prior work. The results can also help to extend functional independence through real-time assistance, while the outcomes can assist family planning, provision of care, and design of real-world and lab-based measures of functional performance. This work is important because of the increasing number of older individuals experiencing cognitive and functional limitations due to chronic health conditions. Furthermore, they address the need for individuals to remain functionally independent as long as possible in their own homes, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and provide assistance with everyday activities for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings for functional health assessment and intervention. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline,10092007,R01AG065218,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Family Planning', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'health assessment', 'health care availability', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smart home']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,600384,-0.012241541668659522
"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions.

"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,9969419,R01DK116163,"['5 year old', 'Acute Diarrhea', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bangladesh', 'Beds', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'IV Fluid', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'International Unit', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Rehydration Solutions', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical examination', 'clinical predictors', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diarrheal disease', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'international center', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2020,618136,-0.0149017524774225
"Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma SUMMARY: In 2016, nearly 50,000 adults in the US were diagnosed with oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and nearly 10,000 died from the disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as the most common cause of oropharyngeal (OP) SCC in the US. Although concomitant chemo- and radio-therapy is the most common treatment choice in patients with advanced OP-SCC, they have substantial short- and long- term morbidity and result in increased health care costs in patients who are cured of their cancers. These patients live with sometimes disabling morbidity for many years post-treatment. For these reasons, it has been suggested that therapy in lower risk patients might be de-escalated. There is also a higher risk cohort of patients in whom treatment with chemo-radiation may be insufficient, often resulting in distant metastatic failure. As such, these patients may require intensified therapies to improve outcomes. This is an agonizing choice for patients and their doctors, however. While patients do not want to be sickened by morbid treatments, they are obviously concerned about having the best chance at cure. Unfortunately, there currently are no companion diagnostic tools to identify which HPV + OPSCC patients are at (1) low risk of recurrence such that they can be treated safely to high cure rates with de-escalated therapy; (2) higher risk of failure despite aggressive high dose chemoradiation in whom treatment intensification strategies should be studied.  Recently, we developed a quantitative histomorphometric based image risk classifier (QuHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to predict progression in HPV+ OP-SCC patients; the current version of QuHbIC has already been validated in >400 patients and found to be superior to clinical variables in outcome prediction. In this Academic-Industry Partnership we seek to further improve predictive accuracy of QuHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as promising markers of unfavorable prognosis in HPV+ OP-SCC. We also seek to create a pre-commercial QuHbIC companion diagnostic test that is ready for clinical use in risk stratification in p16+ OP-SCC. QuHbIC will be trained on >700 retrospectively identified HPV + OP-SCC whole tissue slide images with associated long term outcome data and then validated on 440 cases from randomized, controlled, multi-institutional RTOG 0129 and 0522 clinical trials.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) computational histomorphometry from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve University, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in HPV+ OPSCC from Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic and, (3) Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company that will bring quality management systems and production software standards to establish QuHbIC as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for oropharyngeal cancers. Project Relevance: In this project we propose to optimize and validate a quantitative histomorphometric-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to better risk stratify survival among p16+ (Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related) OPSCC patients. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be either ""de-escalated”, left as standard, or even potentially escalated, depending on risk status.",Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma,9884742,R01CA220581,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Head Cancer', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International Union Against Cancer', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stage Grouping', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Universities', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'common treatment', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'economic need', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'pharynx squamous cell carcinoma', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,624150,-0.04156100242475811
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients.

"A multifaceted adaptive mobile application to promote self-management and improve outcomes in heart failure PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) is the most common hospital discharge diagnosis among older adults in the United States. Strikingly, 2 in 5 patients are readmitted within 1-year following their first HF admission. This results in significant potentially avoidable costs to our already strained healthcare system, since hospitalizations result in 70% of yearly HF management costs. The most common causes of readmission are failure to recognize clinical worsening and dietary nonadherence. As a result, HF management is rapidly evolving from the traditional model of face-to-face follow-up visits toward a proactive real-time technological model of assisting patients with monitoring and self-management while in the community. While several HF studies have implemented technologically-driven disease management programs, results have been mixed. These systems effectively deliver monitoring data and alerts to healthcare providers. However, their effectiveness in delivering behavioral interventions to patients and modifying patient behavior, a crucial factor in HF self-management, is unknown. Therefore, it is imperative to develop and test patient- centered technologies that deliver behavioral interventions to promote self-management for the most common causes of readmissions with an overall goal of reducing HF readmissions. This proposed project will determine the effectiveness of two interventions within a mobile application and builds on our work from previous research. Our central hypothesis is that a patient-centered mobile application with contextual just-in-time interventions about self-management during a clinical worsening and dietary sodium will improve the health status of HF patients. The rationale for this project, which is supported by our preliminary data, is that a new model for disease management - placing patients in control of their condition - will have a substantial positive impact on HF outcomes. Our objectives are to: (1) determine the impact of two unique adaptive mobile application interventions on HF readmission and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HF patients, (2) establish the effect the interventions have on proximal outcomes and that the proximal outcomes mediate the intervention’s impact on HF readmission and HRQOL, and (3) develop data-driven machine learning models that can predict episodes of clinical worsening.

"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved evidence-based care approaches to diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether.",Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia,9914128,R01MH117172,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disorientation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Psychology', 'Source', 'Stigmatization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital media', 'digital models', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'family burden', 'first episode schizophrenia', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention program', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'medical complication', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social observations', 'stem', 'support tools', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'volunteer', 'willingness', 'young adult']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,640014,0.0035516140506507837
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes. Narrative The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the search of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. We will develop methods for feature engineering, electronic phenotyping and patient matching from real-world EHR data.

"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes. This innovative study will rigorously assess whether the implementation of an 'anesthesiology control tower', with sophisticated decision-support tools, improves the care, safety and outcomes of surgical patients.","TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial",9930157,R01NR017916,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Certified registered nurse anesthetist', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Delirium', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enabling Factors', 'Engineering', 'Evidence based practice', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Network-based', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Perioperative complication', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Update', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'postoperative delirium', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'routine care', 'safety outcomes', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'waiver']",NINR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,644350,0.0182580289525344
"Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities Project Summary/Abstract From 2000-2014, hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, incidence rates increased nearly 4% per year, while most cancers in the United States were on the decline. HCC disproportionately impacts minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. To inform primary prevention strategies that will reduce disparities in HCC risk, we need to determine the relative contribution of well- established and emerging (e.g., hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, alcohol, smoking, cirrhosis, NAFLD, metabolic disorders, diabetes, HIV infection), and novel (e.g., medications, comorbidities, neighborhood attributes) risk factors to these disparities. To inform secondary and tertiary prevention strategies to reduce disparities in HCC burden, we need to understand the multilevel factors that contribute to HCC surveillance disparities. Answering these gaps in knowledge requires a robust high-quality study with a sample enriched for racial/ethnic minorities. Thus, we propose to leverage existing multi-disciplinary collaborations to develop an integrated dataset that includes electronic health records (EHR) data linked to population-based state cancer registry data and geospatial contextual data. This multilevel resource will include data on nearly 2.3 million individuals from three healthcare systems (mixed payer, integrated healthcare, federally qualified health centers) in California and Hawaii, thus providing diversity in healthcare settings and enrichment for racial/ethnic minorities: 59,400 are Black, 189,500 are Hispanic, and 441,700 are Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI). With this resource, we specifically aim to: (1) assess the relative importance of established and emerging examine the extent to which these factors independently and jointly contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk; (2) discover novel risk factors and assess their relative importance to HCC risk; and (3) assess racial/ethnic disparities in adherence with surveillance for HCC as well as examine the extent to which these disparities are attributable to modifiable individual-, clinician-, system-, and neighborhood factors (Aim 3). For Aim 1, using prospective data, we will assess the relative importance of risk factors and their contribution to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk with causal inference methods. For Aim 2, we will apply innovative machine learning methods to identify novel factors and validate their associations with HCC risk using modeling strategy from Aim 1. For Aim 3, we will use multilevel generalized linear regression to investigate the patient, clinician, institutional and geographic factors that contribute to disparities in HCC surveillance. Given the importance of sex and age/birth cohort for HCC risk, these social determinants will be considered together with race/ethnicity using an intersectional approach. By applying a multilevel framework to understand how biological, clinical, and social factors at multiple levels contribute to HCC disparities in incidence and surveillance, the proposed study will identify modifiable factors that can be translated to the clinical and community settings to collaboratively identify strategies to ameliorate racial/ethnic disparities in HCC. Project Narrative While most cancer incidence and mortality in the United States are declining, the burden of liver cancer is increasing; yet, we do not understand what causes 40% of these cancers. Furthermore, this cancer impacts racial/ethnic groups disproportionately, with minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. Therefore we propose to study the relative contribution of established and emerging risk factors, discover and validate novel risk factors, and to understand patient, clinician, healthcare system and geographic factors that influence surveillance; these findings can then be used to inform strategies in clinical and community settings to reduce the burden of liver cancer particularly for those at high risk.",Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities,9997828,R01CA225478,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Alcohols', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'HIV Infections', 'Hawaii', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Maintenance Organizations', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive measure', 'Primary Prevention', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'built environment', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer health disparity', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'comorbidity', 'data registry', 'disparity reduction', 'electronic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'sex', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social disparities', 'social factors', 'socioeconomics', 'tertiary prevention']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,645058,-0.05323561485366474
"Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture Over 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the U.S. and up to 25% of hip-fracture patients die within a year of their injury. Despite the importance of this clinical problem, the diagnostic screening rate for osteoporosis is only 5% of the eligible population, and the sensitivity of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA, the clinical standard test for diagnosis, is only 50%. Therefore, most patients are not being screened diagnostically for osteoporosis, and for those who are, about half who will experience a hip fracture are missed. Given that the current empirical approach is inadequate, we propose to pursue a more mechanistic approach, combining state-of-the-art biomechanics and machine learning approaches. Biomechanically, the three etiological elements of hip fracture are fall risk, femoral strength, and femoral impact force. In this project, our overall goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how all three biomechanical etiological elements interact in the event of a hip fracture and from that, directly improve clinical fracture risk assessment through the use of a single predictive “Integral Biomechanical Risk (IBR)” parameter. In addition, we will also address the problem of low DXA screening rates by further developing our Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) technology. This test estimates the breaking strength of the femur using finite element analysis of routine clinical CT scans previously acquired for any medical reason, and represents an improvement compared to the use of BMD alone. Since millions of patients are scanned with CT each year, this approach could double screening rates if offered as an alternative to DXA. The proposed study will investigate this biomechanical approach in a large incident hip fracture, case-cohort study (3,000 patients with hip fracture, 6,000 without). This retrospective study will include patients seen at Kaiser Permanente who had an abdominal CT scan as part of medical care prior to any hip fracture; and have standard geriatric measurements in their electronic medical records, which we will use to estimate fall risk. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) utilize electronic medical record data and CT scans to obtain patient-specific measurements related to fall risk, femoral strength, and fall severity, and 2) combine the different elements of hip fracture etiology into the IBR parameter to test the hypothesis that this metric predicts hip fracture independent of age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity, and history of prior fracture and improves hip fracture prediction compared to the clinical standard (BMD with FRAX). Scientifically, a major novelty of this work is its use of contemporary machine learning algorithms to inform construction of a mechanistic model of the three etiological elements of hip fracture, which should better capture any interactions between these elements compared to a purely statistical-regression approach. In addition, the study cohort will be the largest and most diverse CT-based hip fracture cohort ever assembled. Importantly, positive results from this project would provide a compelling “second front” to DXA that could be quickly translated to widespread clinical practice, profoundly impacting osteoporosis care. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE More than half of individuals who experience hip fracture do not have osteoporosis as assessed by DXA. This project draws together the latest technological advances in CT-based finite element modeling and combines it into a probabilistic model of fracture risk that uses as inputs, data typically available in medical records.

"Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients Project Summary / Abstract If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) during surgery, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve postoperative outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The goal of this proposal is to develop, validate, and test real-time intraoperative risk prediction tools based on electronic health record (EHR) data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms to predict CRI and make the databases of intraoperative data and waveforms used for these developments freely accessible. This is extremely relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted to an Intensive Care Units (ICU) in one year, more than 42 millions undergo surgery annually. Previous and ongoing studies conducted in the ICU and in the step down unit have built the architecture to collect real-time high-fidelity physiological waveform data streams and integrate them with patient demographics from the EHR to build large data sets, and derive actionable fused parameters based on machine learning (ML) analytics as well as display information in real time at the bedside to drive clinical decision support (CDS) in the critical care setting. The goal of this proposal is to apply these ML approaches to the complex and time compressed environment of high-risk surgery where greater patient and disease variability exist and shorter period of time is available to deliver truly personalized medicine approaches. The work will be initiated using an already existing annotated intraoperative database from the University of California Irvine including EHR and high-fidelity waveform data. This operating room database already exists and needs only to be extracted. This data will be used for the initial training and development of the ML model that will then be tested on prospectively collected University of California Los Angeles and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center databases. Simultaneously, this approach will use existing knowledge of CRI patterns derived from previous step down unit / intensive care unit cohorts, MIMIC II data, University of California Irvine data, and animal studies to create smart alarms and graphic user interface for clinical decision support based on functional hemodynamic monitoring principles. The next step will then leverage the focus on the issues and strengths of the intraoperative environment, some of which can be listed as: 1) Known patients characteristics before surgery to define pre-stress baseline, allowing functional hemodynamic monitoring stress evaluations, preconditioning, and other preoperative calibrations, 2) High degree of direct observation and data density during most phases of surgery allowing close semi-autonomous monitoring and titration of novel treatment algorithms early, 3) Defined stages in the initial part of surgery (induction, intubation, skin incision) allowing ML approaches to build large common relational database registries, and 4) Defined surgical procedure and stressors (anesthesia induction, intra-abdominal air insufflation, and other surgery-specific interventions), which will alter the impact of CRI on measured variables. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to predict parsimoniously cardiorespiratory instability, etiology and response to treatment in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. Using high-fidelity intraoperative physiological waveform data augmented with extensive electronic health record derived annotation and applying machine learning approaches we will characterize and quantify common patterns in subjects destined to develop cardiorespiratory instability during high-risk surgery. We will use these inputs in simulated real-time bedside management to develop an iteratively designed prototype clinical decision support system suitable for intraoperative care.","Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients",9846016,R01HL144692,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hypotension', 'Insufflation', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data streams', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'electronic data', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'information display', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'iterative design', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'preconditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'relational database', 'response', 'simulation environment', 'stressor', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,648089,0.016202985781894046
"Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data PROJECT SUMMARY This study will leverage large-scale clinical data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify existing pharmaceutical agents commonly prescribed for a multitude of indications that are incidentally associated with improvements in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Through prior efforts, a data source containing almost 20 years of treatment data on all (over one million) VA users diagnosed with PTSD between October 1999 and February 2018 has been constructed, including a complete historical record of their evidence-based medication and psychotherapy receipt within the VA healthcare system. Importantly, the team has also amassed symptom-level patient-reported PTSD outcome data for hundreds of thousands of these patients. The existing data is a powerful resource with which the research team proposes to explore the following specific aims: (1) identify off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms over time; (2) further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of newly-identified off-label pharmaceutical agents for improvement in PTSD symptoms using rigorous causal methods; and (3) identify common adverse events related to off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms in this complex, psychiatrically and medically ill population The proposed project will identify agents that may merit further rigorous clinical evaluation for psychiatric benefit. New therapeutic targets may be identified that will lead to greater treatment options or specific treatments. Further, identification of off-label medications that improve or have contraindicated effects for psychiatric populations will provide critical guidance to practicing clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, there are few psychopharmacologic treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and available medications do not work sufficiently. In a recent published statement, NIMH noted that “The National Institute of Mental Health would relish the chance to partner with our VA colleagues to exploit [VA data] with the aim of providing guidelines for evidence-based pharmacotherapy for those suffering from PTSD, Veterans and civilians alike.” The proposed study was specifically designed in response to that call; it will use exploratory methods to identify off-label medications that are effective for the treatment of PTSD using a large VA medical records-based dataset.",Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data,9858600,R01MH121397,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Paroxetine', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Scanning', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label drug', 'prospective', 'psychopharmacologic', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy development', 'treatment guidelines', 'venlafaxine', 'working group']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,648991,0.0018869829537788625
"Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence ABSTRACT  Interventions in clinical settings, such as the emergency department (ED), are an opportunity for interpersonal firearm violence prevention, particularly among youth, whom interpersonal firearm violence disproportionately affects. A crucial prerequisite to successful clinical interventions is an accurate gauge of risk, to ensure the judicious allocation of scarce resources; providing that missing prerequisite is the primary goal of the proposed work. Machine learning methods, in contrast to traditional inferential statistical models, are distinguished by their emphasis on prospective prediction, and have enhanced clinical prediction in several fields, including heart disease, cancer diagnosis and outcomes, PTSD, suicide risk, and substance use, among others. Yet, with the exception of the SAFETY score—developed by the current investigative team—machine learning methods have not been leveraged to prospectively predict firearm violence. In this proposed work our research objectives are two-fold: 1) Externally validate the SAFETY score by determining its ability to predict firearm violence involvement within the next year on a new data set; and 2) Improve the SAFETY score by conducting a comparative analysis of four powerful machine learning methods: elastic net penalized logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and boosting (ensemble) methods. In this way, we are responding to Objective One: Research to help inform the development of innovative and promising opportunities to enhance safety and prevent firearm-related injuries, deaths, and crime. This approach is innovative because it builds upon the only work to apply machine learning methods to firearm violence prediction, and it is a promising opportunity to prevent firearm injuries because it will a) provide an explicit gauge of future firearm violence risk; and b) characterize risk factor effects in terms of their prospective prediction ability, unlike any prior research. Thus this research will both identify individuals in most need of intervention, and also point to potentially modifiable predictive factors. Properly addressing this research question in a generalizable way requires a contemporary data set with 1) a focus on a high-need, yet broad, study population; 2) comprehensive baseline measures that provide a broad basis for prediction; and 3) geographic variability (Midwest, West Coast, and East Coast) that enhances generalizability. Thus, we will recruit 1,500 youth age 18-24 from urban EDs in three broadly different locales—Flint, Philadelphia, and Seattle—and administer a baseline survey covering several domains of potential risk factors for future violence, and follow up with those youth at 6- and 12-months to ascertain the primary outcome—firearm violence involvement (as victim or perpetrator)—as well as the secondary outcomes: high-risk firearm behaviors, non-firearm violence, and violent injury. Because this work requires a prospective longitudinal study, we are applying for Option B. This work will lay the ground for future research involving the development and testing of interventions for interpersonal firearm violence both by identifying potential high- leverage modifiable predictive factors, and by identifying youth most in need of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The purpose of the proposed work is to harness cutting-edge machine learning methods to optimize prediction of future firearm violence so that prevention resources can be allocated efficiently. In service to that goal, we will recruit participants age 18-24 from three urban emergency departments, administer a comprehensive assessment, and use the measurements taken there to predict firearm violence over the following year. The proposed work will provide generalizable knowledge on what factors are most predictive of future firearm violence, which will contribute to future intervention strategies both in terms of content and in terms of optimally determining which people require intervention.",Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence,10162695,R01CE003294,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,649991,-0.04542593405473145
"Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial. Nearly half of people currently living with dementia have not received a diagnosis, delaying access to treatment as well as education and support for the patient and family. Thus, NIA has requested applications to support pragmatic clinical trials of low-cost tools to improve detection of cognitive decline in clinical settings (RFA-AG- 20-051). With pilot funding from NIA, we used machine learning to develop a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule), which uses easily accessible information in the electronic health record (EHR) to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. In addition, we interviewed patients, caregivers, clinicians, and healthcare system leaders to inform pragmatic implementation of eRADAR in clinical settings. Stakeholders felt strongly that such a tool should be implemented through primary care, in the context of existing clinical relationships, and would need to be accompanied by additional support for patients and clinicians. Our current proposal is heavily informed by this development work. In Aim 1, we will use EHR data to evaluate eRADAR's performance in different patient subgroups, including by race/ethnicity, in two healthcare systems to inform selection of cut- points for use in clinical settings. We will select an optimal cut-point to use for targeted dementia assessment with stakeholder input, balancing sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. In Aim 2, we will perform a pragmatic clinical trial to determine whether implementing eRADAR as part of a supported outreach process to high-risk patients improves dementia detection. The setting will be primary care clinics within Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA), an integrated healthcare delivery system in Washington State, and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), an urban, academic healthcare system with a diverse patient population. The study includes 6 clinics with ~24,000 patients age ≥65. Within each clinic, primary care providers (PCPs) will be randomly assigned to have their patients with high eRADAR scores targeted for outreach (intervention) or to usual care (control). Our clinical research staff—whose roles were designed to reflect existing roles within these healthcare systems to maximize pragmatism—will reach out to patients with high eRADAR scores, conduct an assessment for cognitive impairment, make follow-up recommendations to PCPs, and support patients after diagnosis. Patients with high eRADAR scores in both treatment arms will be followed to determine the impact of eRADAR on new diagnoses of dementia (primary outcome) as assessed from the EHR (again, to maximize pragmatism). In Aim 3, we will explore the impact of eRADAR implementation on secondary outcomes including healthcare utilization and experience of patients and family members. If this pragmatic trial is successful, the eRADAR tool and process could be spread to other healthcare systems, potentially improving detection of cognitive decline, patient care, and quality of life. Most patients with cognitive impairment are diagnosed relatively late in the disease process, and about half of people living with dementia are undiagnosed. We have developed a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule) that uses information in electronic health records to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. This study will determine whether a supported process of reaching out to patients with high eRADAR scores as part of primary care leads to earlier detection of dementia and improves patient care.","Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial.",10091300,R01AG069734,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'California', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Underweight', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'comparison intervention', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'outreach', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'usual care arm']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,650000,0.006490753828590113
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,9925731,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2020,653985,-0.01447294979737545
"ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY Need: Nearly half (34 million) of all hypertension (HTN) patients have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. Despite medication and life-style management, the cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs. HTN is the leading cause for stroke, heart failure (HF) and myocardial infarction (MI) hospitalizations. Clinical trials have shown that active pharmacological treatment management of HTN to BP goal reduces the incidence of stroke by 35-40%, MI by 15-25%, and HF by up to 64%.  Solution: In response to the national “epidemic” of uncontrolled HTN, Optima Integrated Health has developed optima4BP. optima4BP is an artificial intelligence (AI) that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized. The innovation was developed with the physician in mind by simulating the in-office clinical reasoning treatment decision process. optima4BP is a physician decision support aid that safely and when needed optimizes the pharmacological treatment for HTN. optima4BP is interoperable in real-time with the EpicÒ Electronic Health Record (EHR), constantly evaluating the efficacy of patients’ current treatment and the requirement for optimization. When a treatment optimization is needed, optima4BP communicates directly with the treating physician by providing a recommendation in the EHR In-Basket that can be accepted or declined.  Goal of Direct to Phase II: ARTERY Outcomes [tailored drug titration through artificial intelligence: an interventional study] is a 12 months follow-up, randomized clinical trial (n=300) that: Evaluates optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control [Aim 1], and Ensures Data Systems Maintenance [Aim 2].  Aim 1. Evaluate optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control. We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial (ARTERY Outcomes) at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC). We will investigate the safety and efficacy of optima4BP in improving BP control compared to standard of care (SoC). The primary end-point will examine the reduction in systolic BP (SBP) between in-office start and end of study. Milestone: optima4BP reduces SBP by >6 mmHg than SoC. The safety of using optima4BP will be investigated as a secondary outcome in the context of reported adverse events (AEs).  Aim 2. Ensure data systems maintenance (DSM). DSM is a critical activity that includes optimization, error correction, deletion of discarded features and enhancement of existing features. UCSF MC and Optima IT teams will address (1) Data Acquisition upgrades and patches of any system/component within the data flow; and (2) Surveillance management that addresses systems errors, and performs audits/upgrades on the data repository [data warehouse]. Milestone: Ensure the validity of the collected-processed-analyzed data.  Commercial Application: With a growing need for value-based care, optima4BP is strongly positioned to support this specific care coordination model. Our goal is to simplify the care management of high blood pressure (BP) with the goal of reaching BP control, demonstrated to reduce the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.

"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,10187768,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'hospital readmission', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,656378,0.004457449319885521
"Leveraging machine learning to improve risk prediction for chemotherapy induced neuropathy Project Summary/Abstract Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) affects more than two-thirds of adults with invasive cancer who receive select adjuvant chemotherapies (e.g., taxanes, platinum analogs). Severe CIPN symptoms can lead to chemotherapy dose reductions, treatment delays, or changes in treatment regimens; thereby affecting the potential curative effects of chemotherapy. For some patients, CIPN symptoms can persist over time, contributing to lower quality of life.  Little is known about risk factors for CIPN. Chemotoxicity risk scores have been developed and evaluated for use among elderly patients receiving chemotherapy. However, these tools generally report moderate predictive accuracy (60%-70%), small sample sizes, and short-term follow up. We are aware of no publicly available, validated risk models to assess risk of severe and chronic CIPN among diverse patients at risk for this potentially disabling side effect.  The goal of this proposal is to identify patients at risk for CIPN and to understand how patients and provider interpret and use CIPN risk information in clinical decision-making. Focusing on more than 8,500 insured adults (18+) diagnosed with invasive, stage I-III breast and II-IIIA colorectal cancers (2013-2021) who received adjuvant chemotherapy treatment with known risk for CIPN, we will develop and validate predictive models to quantify the risk of severe CIPN and incident chronic CIPN and assess how CIPN risk information might be used to inform clinical decision-making about cancer treatment and survivorship care planning.  We hypothesize that CIPN risk is a high priority for patients in thinking about treatment choice and survivorship care planning. In addition, we hypothesize that the relative importance of CIPN risk for patient and provider decision-making will vary by patient characteristics (e.g., age, cancer stage). We anticipate that the risk of severe and chronic CIPN can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using electronic health records and machine learning methods.  The study team has significant and complementary expertise in health services research, biostatistics and predictive modeling, oncology practice, cancer epidemiology, pharmacotherapy, drug safety and the patient care experience. To our knowledge, this will be one of the first studies to develop and validate a CIPN predictive model that can be used by oncology teams to inform treatment and care planning decisions and improve patient-valued outcomes. Translation and replication of the findings will be catalyzed through publication in peer-reviewed journals and the development and distribution of free software to facilitate testing and adaptation of the resulting risk models across diverse systems of care. Narrative Two out of three people treated with select types of chemotherapy experience a side effect known as peripheral neuropathy that causes pain, discomfort and numbness in the extremities and contributes to poor quality of life. We do not know who is at greatest risk for this side effect or how patients and providers weigh the risks of neuropathy against the potentially life-saving benefits of cancer treatment. The proposed study will help identify patients at high risk for chemotherapy induced neuropathy and assess how patients and clinicians might use information about neuropathy risk to make better informed decisions about cancer care.",Leveraging machine learning to improve risk prediction for chemotherapy induced neuropathy,9955985,R01CA249127,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Breast', 'Cancer Survivorship', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Goals', 'Health Services Research', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neuropathy', 'Numbness', 'Obesity', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Platinum', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Savings', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Vinca Alkaloids', 'analog', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'care systems', 'chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy induced neuropathy', 'clinical decision-making', 'community based practice', 'comorbidity', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fall risk', 'follow-up', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical ability', 'medication safety', 'neurotoxicity', 'older patient', 'predictive modeling', 'side effect', 'survivorship', 'taxane', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,663447,-0.01372131034959214
"The Impact of Air Pollution Exposure on COVID-19 Severity and Mortality PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently the most emergent public health disaster of the entire world. COVID-19 disproportionately affects older adults, people having history of smoking and comorbidities like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. There is no vaccine and treatment for COVID-19, therefore, public health interventions have been taken to control disease transmission. Also, searching modifiable environmental factors that can help reduce the COVID-19 severity and mortality is crucial. Air pollution exposure has been shown to have a systemic effect on the human body including lung function impairment and immune alterations. Recent two ecologic studies from Europe and the United States have suggested that higher long-term ambient air pollution exposure (PM2.5 and NO2) significantly contributes to the COVID-19 mortality. These findings from aggregated data of air pollution exposure and total number of deaths in large geographic areas need to be further verified by cohort study with individual data of air pollution exposure and COVID-19 case progression and mortality. Also, susceptibility factors such as low social economic status (SES), race/ethnicity, smoking exposures and comorbidities need to be accounted for in the analysis. To address the urgent public health question about the role of air pollution exposure in COVID-19 progression, we propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study based on the existing EMR data of all COVID- 19 cases (n>7000) diagnosed at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) medical centers. Specific aims of this proposal have been expanded from our ongoing NIEHS-supported R01 study investigating prenatal air pollution exposure and children's autism risk among 440,000 KPSC mother-child pairs (APAR study, 1R01ES029963). In this proposal, the main outcomes of interest are COVID-19 severity assessed by hospitalization, ICU admission and ventilator use, as well as death. Details dates will be available through EMR. Natural language processing technologies will be applied to identify the date of first COVID-19 symptom onset for each case. Thereafter, the earliest date among COVID-19 symptom onset and clinical diagnosis will be used as the study entry date. Then short- and long-term air pollution exposure will be estimated for each case by averaging air pollution exposure levels during one-month and one-year before the study entry date. Both ambient (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3) and traffic-related (line dispersion model estimated NOx) air pollution exposure will be assessed based on individual residential addresses. Detailed residential history of all KPSC members have been well-maintained by the KPSC system. Key covariates including age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking exposure, body mass index, comorbidities, medication use, and meteorological data will be extracted to control for confounding and identify susceptible high risk subgroups. With the unique cohort data resource and world-renowned epidemiologists and exposure scientists, this one-year study will greatly enhance our knowledge about the effect of air pollution exposure on COVID-19 progression and death. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study is proposed in response to the urgent need of large cohort studies investigating the contributions of environment such as air pollution exposure to the COVID-19 epidemic and mortality. The study is very likely to have a high impact on identifying key environmental factors that can prevent or ameliorate COVID-19 progression.",The Impact of Air Pollution Exposure on COVID-19 Severity and Mortality,10152911,R01ES029963,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Animals', 'Asthma', 'Body mass index', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Fatality Rates', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'China', 'Chronic', 'Cities', 'Cohort Studies', 'Coronavirus', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Europe', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Humidity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Meteorology', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Design', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severities', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Ventilator', 'Virus', 'ambient air pollution', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'coarse particles', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'fine particles', 'high risk', 'interest', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'public health intervention', 'respiratory infection virus', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'traffic-related air pollution']",NIEHS,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,670296,-0.035739640300964354
"Biomedical Informatics Tools for Applied Perioperative Physiology Project Summary / Abstract Even though US hospitals have widely adopted electronic health record (EHR) documentation of patient care, interoperability of these systems remains an issue, leading to challenges in data integration. In the operating room (OR) setting, during surgery, physiological waveforms (arterial pressure, EKG, SpO2, central venous pressure, etc.) represent a large source of information used by clinical monitors to extract and display information in order for healthcare providers to make clinical decisions. Integration and synchronization of high-quality EHR and physiological waveform data in large datasets of surgical patients would allow machine learning and deep learning approaches to plumb these datasets for clinically relevant signatures that would promote advanced OR patient monitoring systems to define present state, predict state trajectory, suggest effective counter measures to minimize patients decompensated states, and define the usefulness and efficacy of new monitoring devices. The objective of this proposal is to focus the resources of an interdisciplinary team from academia (University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), University of California Irvine (UCI), and Carnegie Mellon University Computer Sciences), industry (Edwards Lifesciences Critical Care), and clinical medicine (anesthesiology, surgery, and critical care at UCLA, UCI, Beth Israel, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) to create, develop, and organize large surgical datasets combining EHR and high fidelity physiological waveform data, to make these datasets freely accessible, and to develop new predictive/forecasting monitoring systems for the surgical patients. The study will begin with the development of a machine learning algorithm to predict cardiovascular collapse during surgery. This algorithm development will be based on physiological signatures predictive of cardiovascular collapse identified in the animal models of shock. The study hypothesis is that the combination of two separate OR databases containing EHR and physiological waveforms will allow for training and development of monitoring solutions, predictive and/or prescriptive analytics tools, clinical decision support, and validate them on an independent, external validation database. The surgical setting is relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted annually to an Intensive Care Unit, more than 50 million undergo surgery. OR databases are unique in medicine because: 1) Changes occur quickly and the lead-time before an event is compressed; 2) Knowledge of baseline/pre-stress status of surgical patients allows normalization, calibration, and markedly enhances prediction; 3) Continuous and immediate presence of dense skilled acute care practitioners allows faster implementation of complex treatment algorithms in the OR; and 4) Defined stages, procedures, and stressors allow building large common relational database registries. By helping to focus the provider's attention on significant events and changes in the patient's state and by suggesting physiological interpretations of that state, such systems will permit early detection of complex problems and provide guidance on therapeutic interventions improving patient outcomes.

"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and efficacy.",Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy,9989043,R01AR074500,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitor', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Engraftment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovitis', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'arthritis therapy', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'chronic autoimmune disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'germ free condition', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'joint destruction', 'joint injury', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome components', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'polyglutamates', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'rRNA Genes', 'recruit', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'rheumatologist', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'therapy outcome']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,677759,-0.018933809131913976
"Contextualized daily prediction of lapse risk in opioid use disorder by digital phenotyping PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid use disorder is increasingly widespread, leading to devastating consequences and costs for patients and their families, friends, and communities. Available treatments for opioid and other substance use disorders (SUD) are not successful at sustaining sobriety. The vast majority of people with SUD relapse within a year. Critically, they often fail to detect dynamic, day-by-day changes in their risk for relapse and do not adequately employ skills they developed or take advantage of support available through continuing care. The broad goals of this project are to develop and deliver a highly contextualized, lapse risk prediction models for forecasting day-by-day probability of opioid and other drug use lapse among people pursuing drug abstinence. This lapse risk prediction model will be delivered within the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) mobile app, which has been established by RCT as a state-of-the-art mHealth system for providing continuing care services for alcohol and substance use disorders. To accomplish these broad goals, a diverse sample of 480 participants with opioid use disorder who are pursing abstinence will be recruited. These participants will be followed for 12 months of their recovery, with observations occurring as early as one week post-abstinence and as late as 18 months post-abstinence across participants in the sample. Well-established distal, static relapse risk signals (e.g., addiction severity, comorbid psychopathology) will be measured on intake. A range of more proximal, time-varying opioid (and other drug use) lapse risk signals will also be collected via participants’ smartphones. These signals include self-report surveys every two months, daily ecological momentary assessments, daily video recovery “check-ins”, voice phone call and text message logs, text message content, moment-by-moment location (via smartphone GPS and location services), physical activity (via smartphone sensors), and usage of the mobile A-CHESS Recovery Support app. The predictive power of these risk signals will be further increased by anchoring them within an inter-personal context of known people, locations, dates, and times that support or detract from participants’ abstinence efforts. Machine learning methods will be used to train, validate, and test opioid (and other drug) lapse risk prediction models based on these contextualized static and dynamic risk signals. These lapse risk prediction models will provide participant specific, day-by-day probabilistic forecast of a lapse to opioid (or other drug) use among opioid abstinent individuals. These lapse risk prediction models will be formally added to the A-CHESS continuing care mobile app at the completion of the project for use in clinical care. These project goals position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project’s goals are to develop and deliver a real-time model for forecasting day-by-day opioid use lapse among abstinent patients with opioid use disorder. This lapse prediction model will be integrated into an existing, validated mHealth app to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.",Contextualized daily prediction of lapse risk in opioid use disorder by digital phenotyping,9980350,R01DA047315,"['Abstinence', 'Acoustics', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Distal', 'Drug usage', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Face', 'Facebook', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Narcotics', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Opioid', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Social Network', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'addiction', 'alcohol testing', 'base', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'chronic pain', 'clinical care', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'craving', 'digital', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'drug abstinence', 'experience', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'microphone', 'mobile application', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'real time model', 'recruit', 'relapse risk', 'risk prediction model', 'rural setting', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'sobriety', 'social media', 'stressor', 'suburb']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,681159,-0.00047952874301850844
"Prehospital Diagnostic Biomarker for Large Vessel Occlusion Background: The incidence of Large Vessel Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) has been estimated to be approximately 250,000 patients per year in the United States and is the leading cause of disability and fifth leading cause of death. Although interventional (stentriever) and pharmaceutical (tPA) treatments exist for large vessel occlusion (LVO), their use is limited due to the short time window from symptom onset that these treatments are indicated to be administered in. Moreover, recent estimates suggest only approximately 10% of eligible patients receive interventional treatment which has shown to lead to better outcomes in several worldwide RCTs. In order for intervention to be successful, a standardized, quantitative, field based (pre- hospital) diagnostic tool is needed to improve LVO identification and ensure rapid transfer to a capable medical facility. Currently, the gold standard for stroke diagnosis is CT angiogram (CTA) which is limited to in-hospital use or a low number of mobile stroke ambulances, all costing multi-millions of dollars, requiring expert operators and IV injection of iodine-rich contrast material. Additionally, the clinical stroke assessment scales (RACE, LAMS, CPSS) used in the field although low cost and non-invasive have proven unreliable due to training requirements and low inherent accuracies, with SEN and SPE ranging in a recent study from 0.50-0.64 and 0.83-0.92, respectively. Project Goals and Broad Specific Aims: Validate a biomarker for LVO assessment which can be measured and displayed with a fully automated, non-invasive, transcranial Doppler (TCD) robotic system with performance at or exceeding 90% ROC–AUC (targeting SEN & SPE greater than 90%) to standard of care imaging. Complete a clinical study where Arm 1 demonstrates technical feasibility of the system in acute stroke settings and Arm 2 demonstrates safety, no detrimental change to standard of care, and collect robust data to submit to the FDA an IFU expansion to drive clinical care using our robotic system and the biomarker. The ultimate and future goal of this work is to use the automated device and validated VCI biomarker in a prehospital setting to show improved clinical outcomes after stroke onset due to improved prehospital triage. This work is critical to first validate the biomarker against gold standard CTA, which must be completed in a hospital, to ultimately be used in the pre-hospital setting. Longterm Objective: CTA will not be replaced in comprehensive stroke centers and we do not aim to use our technology to do this in comprehensive centers with CTA. Instead, our technology will be available in centers without CTA or MRA and ultimately in the prehospital environment. The goal of our company is to show that our lower cost, portable, non invasive technology can be used to measure a valid biomarker of large vessel occlusion that can be performed outside of a comprehensive stroke center. The first step is to validate the biomarker, in a center with CTA as a gold standard, which is the ultimate goal of this work. The incidence of Large Vessel Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) has been estimated to be approximately 250,000 patients per year in the United States and is the leading cause of disability and fifth leading cause of death. This work will validate a biomarker for large vessel occlusion (LVO) assessment which can be measured and displayed with a fully automated, non-invasive, transcranial Doppler (TCD) robotic system with performance at or exceeding 90% ROC–AUC (targeting SEN & SPE greater than 90%) to standard of care imaging. The ultimate goal of this work is to use the automated device and validated LVO biomarker in a prehospital setting to show improved clinical outcomes after stroke onset due to improved prehospital triage.",Prehospital Diagnostic Biomarker for Large Vessel Occlusion,9980675,U44NS109952,"['Acute', 'Ambulances', 'Angiography', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Injections', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Iodine', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Pre-hospital setting', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker validation', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'digital', 'disability', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'operation', 'overtreatment', 'portability', 'post stroke', 'research clinical testing', 'robotic system', 'safety and feasibility', 'safety assessment', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'ultrasound blood flow measurement']",NINDS,"NEURAL ANALYTICS, INC.",U44,2020,699413,0.013665877609509302
"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,9981397,R01HL148787,"['Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Event', 'Future', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'arm', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically significant', 'computerized', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary event', 'coronary plaque', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient registry', 'prognostic significance', 'prognostic value', 'prospective']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,714763,-0.0011234542088199653
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up. Project Narrative/Relevance Metabolic syndrome is a major public health problem that affects over one in three American adults and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer.

"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations. Accordingly, we propose a series of prospective investigations involving stroke patients and their medical providers focused on developing, validating, and field-testing a new smartwatch-based AF detection platform, Pulsewatch, to create a mobile technology that can detect paroxysms of AF, accelerate their treatment, is user-centric, and is of great intrinsic acceptability.",Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke,9882313,R01HL137734,"['Adherence', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Representative', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Self Efficacy', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spottings', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cryptogenic stroke', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'heart rhythm', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'lens', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'post stroke', 'preference', 'prospective', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,744627,0.018340455375981394
"Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advanced heart failure is characterized by progressive debilitating symptoms and repeated hospitalizations that degrade quality of life. There is no one criterion to diagnose advanced heart failure; the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to populations. As such, our knowledge of advanced heart failure is truncated and skewed as it is based on information from referral populations and convenience samples. Enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology, experiences, and outcomes of patients with advanced heart failure is critical to developing interventions to improve care and quality of life. To address these gaps in knowledge, this proposal leverages diverse data sources and novel applications of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the epidemiology and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. In Aim 1, we will apply an advanced heart failure definition to a geographically-defined population of individuals with heart failure under the auspices of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. We will determine the prevalence of advanced heart failure, examine the demographic and clinical features of the population, and evaluate the timing of its development and association with risk of outcomes. In Aim 2, we will use machine learning techniques to develop computer algorithms (computable phenotypes) to identify patients with advanced heart failure using electronic health record data. We will then leverage the infrastructure of the National Patient- Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) to validate the performance of the computable phenotypes across diverse patient populations. This will enable the accurate and efficient identification of advanced HF for future applications. In Aim 3, we will use the computable phenotype developed in Aim 2 to prospectively identify individuals living with advanced HF. We will then assess their treatment and illness burdens using a combination of surveys and semi-structured qualitative interviews. This information will be used to inform the development of a palliative care intervention that is tailored to the needs of patients with advanced HF. We will assess the acceptability of the tailored palliative care intervention to stakeholders (patients, caregivers, clinicians). The results of these analyses will provide synergistic information to clarify the epidemiology, case mix, burdens, and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. They will provide a prototype palliative care intervention tailored to decrease burden and improve quality of life in advanced heart failure. Finally, the computable phenotype developed can be used to identify patients with advanced HF for future quality improvement programs, observational studies, and interventional research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with heart failure (HF) develop end-stage, refractory disease (advanced HF), characterized by progressive debilitating HF symptoms that interfere with daily life. However, our knowledge of the epidemiology and impact of advanced HF is severely limited because the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to diverse populations. In this study, we will evaluate the epidemiology and outcomes of advanced HF in a geographically-defined population, develop computer algorithms that can accurately and efficiently identify advanced HF, and assess the burdens and experiences of patients living with advanced HF to enable the design of new interventions to improve care and quality of life.",Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes,9994364,R01HL144529,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Mixes', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Refractory Disease', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Ventricular Function', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'computable phenotypes', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'diverse data', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'rural setting']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,746610,0.017221630670750648
"Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use ABSTRACT: The use of prescription amphetamines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has markedly increased in the last fifteen years, with the greatest increase in adolescents and young adults. In 2007, the FDA mandated changes to stimulant labels to warn of increases in psychosis and mania in patients without pre-existing conditions. Our multidisciplinary research team from Brigham and Women's Hospital and McLean Hospital recently published a landmark cohort study demonstrating an increased risk of psychotic episodes in new users of amphetamine compared to methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Alarmingly, the use of amphetamines increased four-fold over the study period (2004 – 2015). In addition, our data show that prescription amphetamine use has dramatically increased in patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder. Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate knowledge about prescriber-level factors, patient-level factors and disease states that potentiate the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines. Large-scale studies using real-world data are the only option to study the risk of infrequent and serious adverse outcomes. In Aim 1, using incident-user cohort study designs, we will utilize data from two national administrative claims databases to identify prescriber dosing strategies that increase the risk of first-episode psychosis in ~220,000 adolescents and adults with ADHD initiating amphetamines. We hypothesize that there will be a dose-dependent increase in the risk of psychosis. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify patient subgroups at heightened risk of psychosis/mania with prescription amphetamine use. To accomplish this goal, we will perform a case control study using electronic medical records (EMR) from McLean Hospital in ~1,650 patients hospitalized for an initial episode of psychosis or mania compared to ~3,300 controls with a first psychiatric hospitalization for reasons other than psychosis or mania. We will apply natural language processing to unstructured narrative notes to capture detailed patient data not available in claims data. We hypothesize that patients with a family history of psychiatric illness will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without a family history. We also hypothesize that patients with concurrent cannabis use will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without cannabis use. Aim 3 compares the risk of treatment-emergent mania in ~52,000 new users of amphetamine versus methylphenidate in a cohort study of patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, an urgent issue given the known risk of mania with stimulant use. Combined, these studies will provide actionable evidence to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines with the goal of mitigating the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription stimulants. The proposed research agenda aligns with NIMH Strategic Objective 3.3 “Striving for Prevention and Cure” on testing interventions in real-world practice settings to evaluate the impact of patient- and provider-level factors on clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE: In recent years, 6.1 million U.S. children and adolescents were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 16 million adults reported past-year use of prescription stimulants. The research team recently found an increased risk of psychosis in new users of prescription amphetamines compared to new users of prescription methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD, translating to potentially increased risk of psychosis for thousands of U.S. patients. Therefore, identifying patient subgroups and prescribing practices that increase the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines has enormous public health significance and will guide providers to avoid amphetamines in patients at highest risk, preventing future cases of psychosis and mania.",Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use,9939094,R01MH122427,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amphetamine Users', 'Amphetamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Boston', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immigration', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manic', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Modification', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'amphetamine use', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'first episode psychosis', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'patient subsets', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'stimulant use', 'treatment risk', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2020,746678,-0.0023963754529865463
"PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target Need. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in achieving & maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.  Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve & maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT [optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to establish upfront the personalized OT. The OT can then be used to select the shortest and safest treatment modification route needed to achieve & maintain BP Target. Phase II Goal. Build optima4BP 2.0.  Phase I. Phase I Prior Work demonstrated that k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), an AI model, can predict with ≥ 80% confidence the correct anti-HTN treatment, when compared to physician decision.  Phase II. optima4BP 2.0 will predict the Optimal Treatment and route to achieve & maintain BP Target.  Optimal Treatment data-mining source. PROTECT will use the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 2015) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, 2010) clinical trial data. They represent the foundation of the most current anti-HTN treatment management national guidelines.  Aim 1. Build kNN. Hypothesis. kNN can predict the proximity (clinical relevance) of a patient to an Optimal Treatment (OT). Milestone. Achieve ≥ 90% accuracy of prediction to physician decision. Phase I Data Preparation protocol will be applied to the SPRINT & ACCORD data. Then, the kNN Ensemble Learning function will be built to select the Optimal Treatment with the highest demonstrated efficacy by comparing the choice from 3 computational approaches developed and tested during Phase I.  Aim 2. Build the Optimal Treatment Route (OTR). Hypothesis. Knowing the Current and Optimal Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve ≥30% reduction in number of treatment changes compared to physician route. The OTR will be built by comparing at each Step on the Route how similar each Candidate Treatment is to the OT through a computed similarity assessment.  optima4BP 2.0 aims to establish a process-standardized & sustainable solution with the goal of reducing the incidence of stroke, HF, MI and death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension have their blood pressure uncontrolled. We propose to build and test optima4BP 2.0 (Project Name: PROTECT) that will predict upfront the personalized optimal treatment and shortest treatment route required by a patient to achieve and maintain blood pressure target. Achieving and maintaining blood pressure target will reduce the incidence of adverse events [stroke (35-40%), heart failure (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (15-25%)] or death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension.",PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target,9901106,R44HL140624,"['Acute', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Euclidean Space', 'Exclusion', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resources', 'Route', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Women&apos', 's Role', 'Work', 'base', 'blood pressure intervention', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'commercial application', 'comparative efficacy', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'hypertension treatment', 'innovation', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'processing speed', 'response', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke risk', 'success']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2020,750249,0.010310265704547414
"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (“tele-SUD”) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder,9952335,R01DA048533,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental disorders', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'methamphetamine use', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'physically handicapped', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'rural area', 'screening', 'treatment duration']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,756872,-0.0013260053219310433
"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),9912846,R01HL141916,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Agreement', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Environment', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Incidence', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Melons', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Normal Range', 'Nurses', 'Organ failure', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Refractory', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Hemorrhage', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'non-invasive monitor', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,761406,0.02686725668087098
"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user. The system will also provide feedback on quality of measurements to allow the users or care-givers to gauge reliability.",An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension,9998433,R01HL151240,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arteries', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structural Models', 'Supine Position', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'effectiveness validation', 'electric impedance', 'insight', 'instrument', 'model development', 'monitoring device', 'motion sensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'performance tests', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep position', 'supine sleep', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NHLBI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2020,766675,0.005110489508199941
"Clinical and Translational Science Award PROJECT SUMMARY: COMBATCOVID The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every corner of the globe and has redefined healthcare throughout the United States. COVID-19 cases in the New York City tri-state area have reached an extraordinarily high number and have quickly become the epicenter region of the crisis in the United States. In New York State alone, there are over 372,000 confirmed cases as of June 1, 2020. NYU Langone Health (NYULH) has been particularly hard hit, with more than 8,100 COVID-19 hospitalizations to date. In response, the entire clinical research community is marshalling resources in an attempt to improve our understanding of how the virus spreads, how it infects various tissues in the body, which patients are more susceptible to infection and fatal outcomes, which therapeutics improve symptoms and survival, whether the immune response confers long-lasting protection against reinfection, and many other crucially important questions. The complexity of the development of this disease and unpredictability of progression into severity, as well as the variety of phenotypic outcomes observed during and post COVID-19, pose major challenges in understanding, predicting, preventing, managing and treating this disease and its sequelae. Answers to these challenges can only be achieved through the comprehensive analysis of a significantly high number of COVID cases. Given how recent and unknown this disease is, and its inherent epidemic nature, there is a limited number of cases at individual medical institutions. The limitation of number of cases per institution becomes even more relevant when isolating subpopulations with specific health conditions and across the lifespan. This proposed study will aim to overcome the above-mentioned challenges by supporting the formation of a consortium comprising multiple medical institutions in the U.S.: COMBATCOVID (Consortium for Multisite Biomedical Analytics and Trials on COVID-19). COMBATCOVID will bring together electronic health records (EHR) data from multiple participating institutions into a shared centralized database. As part of the COMBATCOVID effort, biorepository data of COVID-19 patients collected by some of the participating institutions will also be shared and linked to the respective EHR data. The COMBATCOVID consortium will be responsible for transferring EHR data pertaining to participating institutions interested in contributing EHR data to the N3C database. PROJECT NARRATIVE: COMBATCOVID The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every corner of the globe and has redefined healthcare throughout the United States. To adequately understand the virus much more data is needed, necessitating sharing of data across multiple institutions.

"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the US, traumatic injury is the number one cause of death for those under 45 years old and these deaths include many patients dying from the consequences of bleeding. Through leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (a scientific analysis approach similarly used in non-medical fields to help answer questions from large amounts of complex information), an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early and assist care providers in selecting the best treatment to minimize complications and death from hemorrhage.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation,10133378,R01HL149670,"['Abdomen', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bedside Technology', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Provider', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'preventable death', 'profiles in patients', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,772462,0.012841272847687426
"Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes PROJECT SUMMARY The advent of surgery to treat congenital heart disease (CHD) in the second half of the 20th century shifted the care paradigm from palliation of disease fatal in infancy to management of lifelong chronic disease through adulthood. There are now more than 1.5 million adults with CHD living in the United States. These patients have a substantial burden of cardiovascular and other medical comorbidities, as well as markedly increased risk for adverse outcomes such as arrhythmia, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, and premature death. The emergence of this population requires new clinical care models as well as the development of novel research tools and infrastructures to address these patients' unique characteristics and healthcare needs. Adult CHD is characterized by substantial complexity, era-dependent heterogeneity in treatment strategies, and time-varying implications of lifelong disease. This burgeoning population is understudied, and the pathophysiology of the component diseases remains incompletely understood. Billing and other administrative codes available in the electronic medical record are neither sensitive nor specific for CHD diagnosis and do not adequately describe many other salient clinical features. As a result, structured data in large administrative databases are not well suited to studying adults with CHD, even when the goal is simply to identify a cohort of patients with a given diagnosis. This constitutes a major impediment to research efforts and is the primary barrier underlying the limited population-based research performed to date. Adult CHD investigation would benefit immensely from methods to establish harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets. While billing codes are inadequate, the information needed to accurately classify adults with CHD is already available in the electronic medical record in the form of clinical notes, comprised mainly of unstructured (“free”) text. Manual data extraction is laborious, resource intensive, and, therefore, not scalable. We propose to apply cutting-edge natural language processing approaches to unstructured text in the electronic medical record to develop computable classifiers for variables fundamental to the study of adults with CHD. We will use two unique institutional data resources at Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital that are already populated with expert-adjudicated labels to train classifiers for key phenotypes that are poorly defined by administrative codes. These classifiers will be validated in an independent patient cohort at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and tested in new disease-specific risk prediction models. This work promises to accelerate CHD research by massively increasing the scale of the patient cohorts that can be studied and by establishing a foundation for improved evidence-based decision support for this underserved population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Administrative billing codes are inadequate to support research for adults with congenital heart disease, a growing but understudied population with a high burden of medical comorbidities. To advance high quality research towards much-needed innovations in clinical care for these patients, we plan to develop novel methods for the creation of harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets that will expand and enhance collaborative research efforts.",Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes,9946462,R01HL151604,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Heart Septal Defects', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease', 'Eisenmenger Complex', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Nomenclature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transposition of Great Vessels', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'administrative database', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data resource', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'large-scale database', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliation', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,784220,0.010609495300956237
"Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 2 million Americans in whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness or stroke. Unfortunately, therapy for AF has limited success, likely because AF represents heterogenous and poorly characterized disease entities between individuals. A central challenge is that it is not clear why a specific therapy works in a given AF patient. This uncertainty makes it challenging to develop a patient-specific approach to tailor therapy for personalized medicine.  The premise of this project is that mechanistic data is increasingly available in AF patients at scales spanning tissue, whole heart and patient levels, yet rarely integrated. We set out to use machine learning (ML), a powerful approach proven to classify complex datasets, to integrate data to address 3 clinical unmet needs. First, electrograms are rarely used to guide therapy in AF, unlike organized rhythms, because they are difficult to interpret. Second, it is difficult to understand how arrhythmia is affected by any specific ablation strategy in AF, unlike organized rhythms. This makes it difficult to improve therapy. Third, it is difficult to identify whether an individual patient will or will not have success from AF ablation. We applied machine learning and novel objective analyses to these questions to develop strategies for personalized AF therapy.  We have 3 specific aims: (1) To identify components of AF electrograms using ML trained to monophasic action potentials (MAP); (2) To identify electrical and structural features of the acute response of AF to ablation near and remote from PVs; (3) To identify patients in whom ablation is unsuccessful or successful long-term, who are poorly separated at present. Each Aim will compare ML to traditional biostatistics, and use objective explainability analysis of ML to provide mechanistic insights.  This study has potential to deliver immediate clinical and translational impact. We will apply specific ML approaches, biostatistics, and computer modeling to our rich multiscale registry. We will develop practical and shareable tools, which we will prospectively test clinically, to deliver meaningful outcomes at tissue, whole heart and patient scales. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, signal processing and biological physics. This project is likely to reveal novel multiscale AF phenotypes to enable personalized therapy. Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem that affects 2-5 million Americans, causing stroke, rapid heart beats, heart failure and even death. In this project, the applicant will apply numerical analysis and machine learning to detailed data acquired from patients undergoing therapy, to better define individual biological types of AF, which may provide a foundation for personalized patient-tailored diagnosis and therapy.",Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation,9995302,R01HL149134,"['Ablation', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dizziness', 'Drug Controls', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'demographics', 'digital', 'experience', 'heart rhythm', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'voice recognition', 'voltage']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,785591,-0.005567744067311463
"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research,9873997,R01MH118233,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data resource', 'delay sex', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'psychiatric genomics', 'random forest', 'sex', 'support tools', 'support vector machine']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,791339,-0.0370152884861007
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9838270,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'feature extraction', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'multiple data types', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,794994,-0.00949588252319996
"Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches Project Summary  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, affecting every 200-1000 people, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria. FH leads to lifetime raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a high risk for premature atherosclerosis and downstream coronary heart disease. FH is designated as Tier 1 disease by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, notably one of only three such diseases, because it is common, is associated with a high risk of premature illness, and is treatable with lifestyle or medications. Great uncertainty exists about the optimal approach to FH screening, which is reflected in conflicting recommendations in national screening guidelines.  We propose to synthesize high quality data from national surveys and population-based cohort studies in a health policy computer simulation model comparing the health and economic value of different FH screening strategies. This study will prioritize the optimal approaches to FH screening in the U.S. population, identifying optimal initial screening age and defining the role of genetic testing in screening.  We have assembled a team of experts in pediatric preventive cardiology, decision analysis, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, population genetics, biostatistics, health economic evaluation, and computer simulation modeling in order to evaluate and compare different FH screening strategies in children and adults. We aim to use this expertise and these methods in order to:   Quantify diagnostic yield, clinical effectiveness, and economic value of universal FH phenotype  screening in childhood or adulthood, and the added value of FH genotype screening   Compare universal FH screening to the alternatives of using family history or a Big Data-based  algorithm to direct targeted screening limited to children and adults with possible FH diagnosis   Quantify the health and economic value of cascade screening families of FH cases  We hypothesize that FH screening in childhood will be the highest value screening strategy in the U.S. population, and that genetic testing will improve diagnosis and treatment decisions most in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., borderline high cholesterol or absent family history). We hypothesize that a machine-learning algorithm will avoid the costs and complexity of universal screening, while yielding a similar case yield, as long as cholesterol testing is sufficiently common in children.  This study will identify the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population and the most influential data based on current knowledge and set the stage for efficiently designed clinical trials of FH screening. This study will be a test case for the concept of a “precision” population health approach to screening for genetically-determined diseases in the general population. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by lifetime elevated cholesterol, which, if uncontrolled, is associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conflicting current national guidelines highlight that the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population is controversial: it is unclear if screening should start in childhood or adulthood, or if it should include genetic testing. We propose to synthesize data from national surveys, high quality cohort studies, and clinical trials of cholesterol lowering interventions in a lifetime cardiovascular disease risk computer simulation model to project the life time health impact of different FH screening approaches and identify optimal screening strategies in children and adults.","Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches",9883835,R01HL141823,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coronary heart disease', 'County', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Policy', 'Hepatocyte', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Low Prevalence', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proxy', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'economic evaluation', 'economic value', 'genetic testing', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'models and simulation', 'pediatric patients', 'population based', 'population health', 'premature', 'premature atherosclerosis', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,804498,-0.06064636919250241
"International Consortium for Multimodality Phenotyping in Adults with Non-compaction Summary Non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is a heterogeneous, poorly understood disorder characterized by a prominent inner layer of loose myocardial tissue. Patients with NCCM are at increased risk of heart failure, stroke, severe rhythm irregularities and death. Current imaging techniques cannot differentiate pathological from benign hypertrabeculation. In addition, current echo/MRI-based criteria of NCCM lead to over-diagnosis of NCCM, provide no prognostic value, and lead to implantation of defibrillators (ICD) and the use of anticoagulation without a positive benefit in many otherwise healthy individuals with non-compacted myocardium. For a growing population diagnosed with NCCM there is an urgent need for better risk stratification to appropriately allocate (or safely withhold) these impactful preventive measures. Our international consortium combines expertise in myocardial disease, cardiac imaging and advanced computer analytics from 5 centers dedicated to the care of patients with cardiomyopathies, and has the ultimate goal to improve care of patients with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. We hypothesize that comprehensive analysis of clinical, genetic, structural and functional information will improve risk stratification. In addition, we hypothesize that detailed structural analysis will allow for differentiation of pathological and benign patterns of non-compaction. In a large cohort of adult patients with suspected NCCM we will perform in-depth phenotyping, including clinical information, pedigree data, genetics, echocardiography and MRI, and follow patients for up to 3 years. We will apply machine-learning based analytics to develop predictive models and compare their performance to currently used models and treatment criteria. Secondly, in a subset of patients we will perform high-resolution cardiac CT for detailed structural characterization of the myocardial wall. Novel analytical methods will be developed to characterize the 3D architectural complexity based on pathophysiological hypothesis, but also using hypothesis-free analyses of raw images using deep learning techniques. In addition, we will investigate associations between myocardial structure and regional contractile function, as assessed by echo and MRI. The aim of this proposal is to identify a structural signature associated with pathological non-compaction and improve developed risk prediction models. This international consortium dedicated to NCCM will be the first to collect genetic and multi-modality imaging data. Discovery of pathological structural signatures through innovative imaging techniques, in relation to myocardial contractility, will advance our understanding of NCCM. There is an urgent clinical need for diagnostic techniques that detect pathological non-compaction and identify patients at risk of devastating complications. This study is clinically relevant because the developed predictive models may permit more effective, personalized preventive care in a growing number of individuals diagnosed with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to the public health because recognition of pathological myocardial non- compaction and identification of patients at risk for embolic stroke, ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death will allow for more effective use of life-saving measures, but also avoid unnecessary ICD implantations and anticoagulation in healthy individuals with benign hypertrabeculation. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission that pertains to the discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.",International Consortium for Multimodality Phenotyping in Adults with Non-compaction,9977674,R01HL146754,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Anticoagulation', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defibrillators', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Event', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Fractals', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Structures', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular non-compaction', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Mutation', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Nature', 'Non-compaction cardiomyopathy', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive therapy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Savings', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'adverse event risk', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'embolic stroke', 'genetic pedigree', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sudden cardiac death', 'thrombogenesis', 'young adult']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,805761,-0.023517475654721884
"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. AC decision-making has become more complex in recent years with the introduction of several target specific oral AC agents. It remains challenging to advise older AF patients about AC since they are frequently at high risk for stroke and complications from AC, particularly bleeding, and data are limited on real-world outcomes of AC among vulnerable populations. Our project, Detecting bleeding Events using Electronic records for Prediction in Atrial Fibrillation (DEEP AF), will leverage novel biomedical natural language processing (NLP) approaches to integrate bleeding-related information from both the structured and unstructured EHR records and statistical and deep learning approaches to predict risk of bleeding on AF patients on AC therapy. DEEP AF will address present knowledge gaps to accurately identify bleeding events from longitudinal electronic health records and to improve bleeding prediction accuracy and focus on modifiable, clinically relevant risk factors, thereby facilitating future large-scale comparative effectiveness studies evaluating AC agents, and helping clinicians develop better approaches to weighing AC risks and benefits.

"Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse PROJECT SUMMARY Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvulopathy affecting over 170 million worldwide. Every year, 0.4- 1.9% of individuals with MVP will develop sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD), and 7% of SCDs in the young are caused by MVP. However, predictors of this devastating outcome are not readily available, and indications for a primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in MVP are lacking. Severe mitral regurgitation explains only 50% of SCA cases in MVP. SCD/SCA risk has also been linked to a bileaflet phenotype with mild MR, mitral annular disjunction (MAD), and left ventricular focal fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images. Such imaging parameters (including LGE) have not been evaluated prospectively. Moreover, they are not consistently found in SCA survivors, and diffuse fibrosis has been proposed as an alternative arrhythmic substrate by our group and others based on CMR/T1 mapping, strain echocardiography, and post-mortem data. Overall, it is challenging to pinpoint a unique imaging phenotype, and uncertainty exists about which MVP patients should undergo CMR. Regardless of arrhythmic phenotype, complex ventricular ectopy (ComVE - defined as frequent polymorphic PVCs, bigeminy or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) is detected in 80-100% of MVP cases prior to SCA or SCD. ComVE, commonly associated with left ventricular fibrosis on CMR, is linked to higher all-cause mortality and SCA rates (20% versus 12% if no ComVE, p < 0.05) based on preliminary cross-sectional data. Our central hypothesis is that MVP patients with ComVE, because of the higher prevalence of either LGE or abnormal T1 mapping, represent ideal CMR candidates regardless of leaflet involvement or MAD, and can be rapidly identified by an automated “surveillance” tool within a large echocardiographic database. Moreover, we hypothesize that fibrosis is the strongest predictor of SCD/SCA in an unprecedented, multi-center effort to longitudinally assess clinical and CMR parameters of arrhythmic risk in MVP. Specifically, we aim to 1) Assess the role of CMR as a screening tool for fibrosis in MVP with ComVE incorporating T1 mapping in addition to LGE in an unselected MVP sample; 2) Develop an echo-based machine-learning algorithm to detect MVP with ComVE, test its association with myocardial fibrosis on CMR and longitudinal SCD/SCA risk; and 3) Build a novel prospective SCD/SCA risk prediction model in MVP. Better selection of CMR candidates and development of a SCD/SCA risk prediction tool inclusive of fibrosis by CMR are expected to dramatically improve risk stratification in MVP and establish future criteria for primary prevention ICD trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, 0.4-1.9% of individuals with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) will develop sudden cardiac death or arrest. In this application we propose to better identify those at risk by using cardiac magnetic resonance and echocardiography-based artificial intelligence, with the long-term goal of selecting those that may benefit most from a defibrillator. .",Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse,10034460,R01HL153447,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Echocardiography', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'High Prevalence', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mission', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Mitral Valve Prolapse', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Prevention', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Screening procedure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'prognostic significance', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'risk prediction model', 'secondary analysis', 'stem', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,810751,-0.006467068706538684
"Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection Project Summary Though cardiac transplantation is a lifesaving intervention, cardiac allograft rejection (CAR) remains a relatively common and serious complication that confers an increased risk of acute graft failure and adverse patient outcomes. For three decades, endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) with histological grading, as recommended by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) has been the broadly applied standard for CAR diagnosis. However, it is widely appreciated that the ISHLT rejection grading standard lacks diagnostic accuracy and has limited ability to discern the mechanism of rejection. These limitations expose patients to risks of both over-treatment and under-treatment, and highlight the unmet need for more accurate and informative approaches to histopathologic analysis of EMB samples. Our team is a leader in computational pathology image analysis with over 200 papers and >30 issued patents in this area. We have already developed and evaluated a computer assisted histopathology grading evaluation (CACHE) scheme which (1) in N=205 patients, had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)=0.95 compared to two cardiac pathologists (mean AUC=0.74) in distinguishing normal from failing hearts and (2) could distinguish low and high ISHLT rejection grades in N=1109 patients with a performance that exceeds that of trained cardiac pathologists. Recognizing the frequent discordance between ISHLT rejection grade and the clinical trajectory of a rejection event, we will further develop and optimize CACHE to identify new “grade agnostic” morphologic biomarkers of clinically serious CAR. Our scientific premise is that morphologic biomarkers prioritized based on their correlation to patients’ clinical trajectories and underlying immunological disease mechanisms will generate an accurate, consistent and informative classifier for diagnosing allograft rejection. In service of this hypothesis, the proposed research will address three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will utilize computational image analysis to discover the morphologic biomarkers of rejection-related injury which are needed to develop a classifier capable of assessing the clinical trajectory of CAR. In Aim 2, we will provide mechanistic annotation of biomarkers identified in Aim 1 through correlation with in-situ immunologic markers using custom multi-parameter immunofluorescence panels. In Aim 3, we employ a multicenter, prospective cohort to validate the diagnostic and mechanistic accuracy of the new rejection classifier developed in Aims 1 and 2. Ultimately, development of a more accurate and mechanistically informative tool for morphologic diagnosis of CAR will improve patient outcomes by reducing over- and under- treatment and inspire applications in other organ transplants. Interestingly, development of a superior histologic diagnostic tool will empower development of alternative, biopsy-free diagnostic approaches that have been handicapped by the necessity of comparison with the flawed ISHLT rejection grade as a reference standard. Project Narrative For heart transplant recipients, allograft rejection remains a relatively common and serious complication associated with adverse patient outcomes. Shortcomings of the current rejection grading standard for heart biopsies leads to both over- and under-treatment, accordingly, this proposal will develop and validate a computer assisted rejection grading classifier that is more accurate, consistent and informative for diagnosing heart allograft rejection. Improved diagnostic accuracy will improve patient outcomes, inspire similar applications in other organ transplants and empower development of additional technologies that have been constrained by the current flawed rejection standard.",Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection,10070406,R01HL151277,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Allografting', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Graft Rejection', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart-Lung Transplantation', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Injury', 'International', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Legal patent', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Stains', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'allograft rejection', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'feature detection', 'graft failure', 'heart allograft', 'heart imaging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overtreatment', 'pathology imaging', 'phenotypic data', 'population based', 'post-transplant', 'prospective', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment choice']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,845590,-0.010472434384480717
"A framework to stratify patient cohorts for clinical management PROJECT SUMMARY  Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have limited functionality to find patients that can benefit by particular interventions. Hence, clinicians are unable to proactively reach-out to these patients, leading to an ever-widening evidence-care gap. The goal of this proposal is to improve healthcare delivery. The objective is to develop a data-framework for accurately finding patients that can benefits from large/population scale interventions. We will investigate two dimensions for improving the patient search—increasing the resolution of the search (aim 1) and increasing the quality of the data that the search is performed on (aim 2). In aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that a rule-based model of the relevant clinical guideline, will find patients with higher accuracy than the conventional queries. The rational is that the rule-based approach will allow complex groupings of the eligibility criteria and will thereby provide a higher resolution of search than conventional query. In aim 2 we will investigate whether machine learning (ML) can improve the accuracy of patient data and contribute to the accuracy of search results obtained through the conventional query and the guideline rule-base. In addition to the above aims, in aim 3 we will automate deployment of the rule-base and ML models and minimize the manual effort for developing ML models. This proposal builds on the lipid management program at Brigham and Women's hospital (BWH). Our work will be focused on finding patients for lipid- management; however, our methodology and tooling will be generalizable to other medical areas and institutions. The study team includes national experts in cardiology, machine learning, health information technology (HIT) and open-source software development. We will create an open-source software platform (i2b2-ML) by extending the popular `Informatics for Integration Biology and the Bedside' (i2b2) platform that we have developed and supported over the past 10 years and that is used by over 200 medical centers. I2b2-ML will extend i2b2's proven ability to characterize patient cohorts for research into the clinical realm. Our study will yield methodology for accurately finding patients that can benefit by clinical intervention and will thereby enable cost-effectiveness of population programs. It will directly help scale the lipid management program at BWH to benefit a wider patient population. Our detailed characterization of the gaps in lipid management at a large healthcare system will potentially inform improvements in the lipid management guideline. The methodology and tooling developed in this project will be disseminated in open-source for potential incorporation in the clinical data infrastructure at other institutions, which will facilitate implementation of population-scale clinical programs across the nation. In addition, the resultant infrastructure will serve as a platform for development of artificial intelligence-based applications to improve clinical care. These outcomes are expected to have a positive impact on health care delivery so that more patients will get the optimal care. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose developing Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), a well-established, open source, platform that is currently used at over 200 hospitals and medical centers to use machine learning for identifying patient groups receiving suboptimal care. The proposed work will enable healthcare institutions across the United States to proactively reach-out to these patients, for delivering the appropriate clinical intervention.

"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization. The tool will be validated across three large and diverse health systems and released as an open source application (SMART App), increasing its potential for rapid implementation in health systems and clinical care.",Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis,9864102,R01MH116042,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Boston', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'outpatient programs', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'socioeconomics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment program']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,847935,0.014110390094069948
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,9890992,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Videoconferences', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'experimental arm', 'experimental group', 'implementation research', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,986375,-0.07871404464154935
"Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Summary: Sepsis is a poorly understood clinical syndrome characterized by a dysregulation of the immune system’s response to infection. It is the leading cause of death and is the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, exerting a $20.3 billion burden in 2011, 5.2% of total costs to the healthcare system nationwide. One of the major challenges facing clinicians is to identify and recognize patients with sepsis and impending organ dysfunction. The clinical manifestations of sepsis are highly variable and the signs of infection and organ dysfunction can be subtle and may mimic other conditions. Sepsis is also highly time critical. Every 1-hour delay in antibiotics after emergency department (ED) triage or the onset of organ dysfunction or shock is associated with a 3–7% increase in the odds of a poor outcome. These conditions have created an environment where physicians have to diagnose a complex, heterogeneous condition in a short timeframe with limited information. There is currently a dire need for a tool that can quickly assess if a patient is at risk for sepsis. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments. This dataset & biobank currently have >2,000 patients, >70,000 proprietary biomarker measurements, >1,200,000 Electronic Medical Record (EMR) parameters, and >25,000 samples banked (all with accompanying full time series EMR data). We currently have executed contracts for 6 total hospital partnerships, with the potential to expand the dataset by >65,000 patients per year if our pipeline were at full capacity. In this proposed project, Prenosis will finalize the first version of the NOSISTM platform by growing our current proprietary dataset & biobank from its current size of about 2,000 patients to over 10,000 total patients (Aim 1). Using the current 2,000 patient dataset, we have demonstrated initial promising endotypes of sepsis that could be useful for a variety of critical clinical problems. As we grow the dataset to 10,000 patients, we will use unsupervised machine learning algorithms trained on roughly half of the patients (5,000) to definitively prove the robustness and usefulness of these endotypes. The other half of the patients (other 5,000) will be used as a multi-site validation cohort for the endotypes determined by the ML algorithms (Aim 2). We will also finalize the actual software platform for the NOSISTM product (Aim 3), including data security, restricted access by collaborators to train and jointly develop products, and templates for business partnerships with potential collaborators (with an initial focus on HIT companies and pharma companies). Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Narrative: At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary. This has obviously catastrophic implications for the future of humanity. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United States with an annual toll of over 230,000 people. Survival rates have been reported to drop by 7.6% per hour appropriate treatment is delayed. This drastic drop in survival rate leads to vast over prescription of antibiotics in hospital settings. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments.

We currently have executed contracts for 6 total hospital partnerships, with the potential to expand the dataset by >65,000 patients per year if our pipeline were at full capacity. In this project, we are proposing work to finalize our NOSISTM product. NOSISTM is a software platform that allows collaborators (hospital IT departments, researchers, health information technology (HIT) companies, drug companies, and government agencies) to utilize the constantly growing proprietary Prenosis dataset & accompanying data-rich biobank. Using NOSISTM, collaborators can develop new sepsis screening technologies and clinical decision support tools, dramatically increase success of clinical drug trials, and revolutionize our scientific understanding of the endotypes of dysregulation of host response.",Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset,10082229,R44GM139529,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Businesses', 'Cause of Death', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Fees', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Security Measures', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Survival Rate', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'University Hospitals', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data de-identification', 'data hosting', 'encryption', 'health information technology', 'machine learning algorithm', 'payment', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,"PRENOSIS, INC.",R44,2020,989523,0.017308695941898187
"Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies). PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Every year Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) adversely affect millions of Americans at a societal cost of more than $200 million.1 Concurrently, half of Americans living with ADRD never receive a diagnosis.2-7 Early detection helps those with ADRD and their caregivers better plan and potentially lessen the burden of lengthy and costly medical care. Current investigational approaches using biomarkers for early detection are invasive, costly, and sometimes inaccessible to patients. The National Institute on Aging calls for the development of effective, scalable and low cost approaches for early detection of ADRD (RFA-AG-20-051). Currently, primary care clinicians provide the majority of care to older adults living with ADRD.1-5 Our interdisciplinary scientific teams have developed and tested scalable early detection approaches.10, 11 We are proposing to evaluate an integrated approach embedded in the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) that leverages Electronic Health Record systems, machine learning models, and patient reported outcomes to deploy a low- cost and scalable approach for early detection of ADRD. Our proposed studies will leverage previously developed machine learning models (Passive Digital Marker) and patient reported outcomes (Quick Dementia Rating Scale). The design of our proposed studies is predicated on the notion that patient screening is done to identify a more targeted group of referral for applicable diagnostic and management services. We will conduct two complementary multi-site studies to evaluate the effectiveness of two scalable approaches for early detection of ADRD. The first study will be a clinical validation study of the three scalable approaches; the Passive Digital Marker (PDM) that uses EHR data, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) that uses patient reported outcomes (PROs) imbedded within the EHR system, and the combination of both (PDM + QDRS). The second study will be a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial of two screening approaches embedded within the AWV, as compared to the AWV-only process, in increasing the incidence rate of new ADRD. In the final year of the study, we will share our codes for both the Passive Digital Marker and the QDRS with Epic headquarters to ensure that these codes are available for any healthcare system with Epic nationwide. The high costs of treating Alzheimer’s disease and the costs incurred by patients and caregivers, both tangible and intangible, are a major threat to public health and the US economy. Developing scalable and low cost instruments and assessments integrated into EHR data will assist physicians in early detection, more and better diagnoses, and clinically meaningful care recommendations. Cost effective, scalable, and noninvasive models are urgently needed to proactively mitigate these costs and prolonged medical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will consist of two complementary studies at diverse urban, suburban, and rural primary care practices within Central Indiana and South Florida. The first study Aim will evaluate the predictive performance of the Passive Digital Marker, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) using Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) data embedded within the Electronic Health Records, and the combined approach (Passive + QDRS) in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD), compared to the gold standard of diagnoses. The second study Aim will evaluate the practical utility and effect of the Passive Digital Marker, the QDRS, and the combined methods in improving the annual rate of new documented ADRD diagnosis in primary care practices. The project will compare different approaches to early detection of ADRD, crucial to the endeavors to stop dementia progression; it will also evaluate the low-cost combined methods and integrated approach to overcome current barriers to ADRD detection.",Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies).,10092237,R01AG069765,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'American', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical dementia rating scale', 'Code', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'early detection biomarkers', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'patient screening', 'response', 'screening', 'societal costs', 'suburb', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,1094329,-0.013633904830090353
"eMERGE Phase IV Clinical Center at Partners HealthCare Abstract: To enable the application of PRS development and implementation, our eMERGE IV proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank (>105,000 consented with genotype data on 40,000), clinical data in the electronic health records (EHR) for >4 million patients from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise, prior leadership in PRS development and state- of-the-art genetic analysis, established expertise in returning genomics results, and experience using information technology to transform clinical processes and assessing outcomes. We propose to build on our expertise to accomplish the specific aims: Aim 1 (Discovery): Hypothesis: Polygenic risks scores will allow us to stratify eMERGE subjects based on genetic risk for common complex traits. Using the largest available genomic data resources, we will calculate and validate new PRS for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and major depression across diverse ancestries. We will 1) compare and benchmark the performance of existing PRS construction methods in different ancestral groups, 2) develop novel statistical methods for robust trans-ethnic PRS prediction, and integrate PRS with established clinical risk factors and family history. We will obtain PRS from our network colleagues for an additional 15-e- phenotypes (total 20) with a goal of identifying high-risk individuals, e.g., top 2% of PRS risk Aim 2 (RiskInsight Report/ELSI): We will develop a “Risk Insight Report” with clinical risk factors, family history, and PRS with evidence-based recommendations for high risk participants (top 2% of phenotype specific PRS distribution) for electronic clinical implementation. We will assess risk communication formats in our ELSI Sub-Aim 1: To test the impact and interpretability of two mock RiskInsight Reports summarizing PRS as either (a) dichotomous (defining the patient as high-risk vs intermediate/low risk) or (b) quantitative (providing a numerical estimate of the percentile of risk for the patient), with linked clinical recommendations in both cases. We will then assess, through surveys of diverse HCPs and patients, the extent to which the mock reports are understood by both HCPs and patients. Aim 3 (Outcomes): Hypothesis: Physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based on eCDS of RiskInsight Reports. Among HCPs for high-risk subjects, we will see at least one change in clinical care after disclosure discussions with subjects. We will recruit 2500 participants for implementation of clinical PRS in RiskInsight Reports using a SMART on FHIR app for eCDS integrated with the EHR. The primary outcome will be whether any HCP took any action within 12 months after receipt of e-CDS defined by ordering screening tests, prescribing a preventive medication, or providing lifestyle advice. We will conduct analyses of the effect of disclosing results to high risk participants to determine how personalized results changed patient outcomes in laboratory values, risk reduction behaviors, or health care utilization. PROJECT NARRATIVE The discovery and clinical use of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for complex traits promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine.

"eMERGE IV Northwest: A partnership to evaluate the use of genomic information in the health care of diverse participants Project Abstract eMERGE IV (E4) proposes to investigate the implementation of 15 “genomic risk assessment” (GRA) scores in a network-wide set of diverse participants. These GRAs will include polygenic risk score (PRS) information, as well as risk information, such as personal and family health history, environmental and social health determinants, and physical and lab measures. The GRA will aggregate these factors into a single score to identify those who would benefit from screening and other interventions. Substantial challenges must be addressed before genomic medicine is a part of standard medical care. We will collaborate to refine multi-ancestry GRAs and support the inclusion of non-genetic risk factors extracted from the electronic health record with innovative natural language processing approaches and apply them in a cohort enriched for Asian ancestry, and sexual and gender minorities. The specific aims of our proposal are designed to use an implementation science approach to advance the integration of genomic data into clinical practice, including evaluation of patient perspectives and economic outcomes, and broadening the impact of eMERGE through collaborations. The University of Washington Medicine dedication to preventative health in a learning health system and broad expertise across genomics, statistical, ethical, informatic, implementation, outcomes and economic disciplines will support this multi-site clinical trial. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Refine GRA scores and outcomes measures for five high impact conditions, considering stakeholder input, for implementation in the electronic health record. The conditions are: colorectal cancer, breast cancer, osteoporosis, coronary artery disease, and glaucoma. Aim 2: Integrate 15 GRA scores and electronic clinical decision support for management into clinical care and the EHR and capture clinical outcomes. Aim 3: Evaluate the implementation, effectiveness, and economic utility of GRA result return.

"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9990638,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'care outcomes', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data archive', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'public health relevance', 'randomized controlled design', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2020,1744950,0.002783392570974395
"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,10131376,R44AG065118,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Centers for Population Health', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use Effectiveness', 'aging in place', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'database structure', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2020,1992588,-0.06816742929248827
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9889924,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2020,2187036,-0.06491936401507425
"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9858205,R44AG059458,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applied Research', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fire - disasters', 'Floods', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Redwood', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'caregiver interventions', 'community setting', 'dementia caregiving', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'emotional behavior', 'emotional functioning', 'flexibility', 'hazard', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'loved ones', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'social media', 'software systems', 'theories', 'user-friendly']",NIA,PEOPLE POWER COMPANY,R44,2020,2217090,-0.008985740036898325
"DIGITAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS FOR COVID-19: PERSONALIZED ANALYTICS WEARABLE BIOSENSOR PLATFORM FOR EARLY DETECTION OF COVID-19 DECOMPENSATION The goal of this project is to develop an artificial intelligence-based data analytics and cloud computing platform, paired with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared wearable devices, to create a personalized baseline index that could indicate a change in health status for patients who have tested COVID-19 positive.  The project involves the development and validation of a COVID-19 Decompensation Index (CDI) that builds off physIQ’s existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics platform.  Data will be collected from 400 human subjects that are both pre-hospitalization subjects (found to be positive for COVID-19) and subjects that have been hospitalized and treated for COVID and then discharged.  This combined population will consist of COVID-19 decompensation cases (event cases) and cases for which COVID-19 did not result in any kind of decompensation (non-event cases).  The 400-patient dataset will be partitioned into a training subset and a testing subset.  Performance will be assessed using receiver operator characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) as the metric of performance.

"Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet no large COPD study has ascertained cardiac function. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study was funded to test the endothelial hypothesis of emphysema and examine reduced RV dimensions (“cor pulmonale parvus”) in COPD. In the MESA COPD Study II, we found that associations of reduced pulmonary microvascular blood flow with emphysema do not appear to be confounded by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and that emphysema on CT predicted RV regression over 5 years. We also developed methods to further subtype emphysema and COPD and scaled them up to the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS). We used unsupervised machine learning to discover new emphysema subtypes that are common and have molecular origins. Separately, we found that 26% of adults have segmental airway variants, which are associated with COPD and the developmental genes FGF10 and RARA. Both genes affect right heart development. In pilot work, we found one dramatically altered RV strain and the other associated with cor pulmonale parvus. Finally, we found that bronchitic ‘symptomatic smokers,’ who have hyperinflation from gas trapping, may have increased LV diastolic dysfunction. Hence, cardiac alterations in COPD are complex but recent advances in COPD subtyping may allow their personalized diagnosis and treatment. SPIROMICS is an NHLBI-funded prospective study that recruited smokers with COPD and controls and is re-examining 2,000 participants with gold- standard lung phenotyping including full-lung CT. We propose to add comprehensive echocardiography (echo) with speckle-tracking for cardiac mechanics for 1,000 SPIROMICS participants, with exercise in 700 and cardiopulmonary MRI in 600, to test the following hypotheses: 1) machine-learned subtypes of emphysema on CT are associated with specific alterations in cardiac structure and function, which vary from cor pulmonale to LV diastolic dysfunction; 2) participants with segmental airway variants have abnormal RV structure and function; 3) symptomatic smokers have signs of increased LV afterload and LV diastolic dysfunction. Innovative aspects of the application include the use of novel echo and MRI measures in a large, well- characterized cohort of COPD patients. Confirmation of the hypotheses would define the mechanisms of HFpEF in COPD and identify subsets of patients for targeted treatment of cardiopulmonary dysfunction. The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction.

"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Acoustic speech analysis of patients with decompensated heart failure Abstract Heart failure (HF) is the most common cause of hospitalization among Americans over 65 years of age. A major goal of HF management is to maintain stability by predicting and preventing episodes of acute decompensated HF (ADHF). Body weight is currently used for non-invasive, at-home monitoring of volume status, and as an early warning for decompensation, by patients with HF. However, HF-related weight changes occur relatively close to the onset of symptoms and may not be detected in time to prevent an episode of decompensation. In contrast, the vocal folds consist of thin tissue layers that are impacted by body hydration levels and may therefore be especially sensitive to HF-related fluid retention. The amount of laryngeal edema required to change voice acoustics is expected to be small relative to the large amount of systemic edema needed to significantly increase body weight. Therefore, we hypothesize that clinicians will be able to detect and track HF-related volume overload more closely by monitoring voice metrics in addition to weight. The goal of this project is to investigate the potential of voice and speech characteristics as correlates of clinical improvement during treatment for ADHF. In a pilot study, acoustic voice and speech measures from ten HF patients undergoing diuresis for HF were analyzed. Several promising voice measures were identified for additional investigation, including measures reflecting higher pitch and increased vocal stability following successful ADHF treatment. In this project, the study size will be expanded to facilitate more rigorous and extensive statistical analysis techniques, including machine learning and multi-level modeling analyses. Additionally, the potential of a neck-surface vibration sensor for noise-robust, confidential monitoring of ADHF status will be evaluated. The vibration sensor has been used extensively for voice monitoring in our lab because it is minimally affected by environmental noise and does not record intelligible speech, making it ideal for recording voice while preserving patient privacy in noisy environments. The performance of microphone-based recordings in predicting patients’ heart failure status will be compared with that of vibration-sensor-based recordings, with the hypothesis that the vibration sensor will work as well as, or better than, a conventional audio microphone. Completion of this project will result in a novel, voice-based method using wearable sensor technology to provide a monitoring system for HF patients recovering from decompensation, and will aid us in future work as we move towards developing an early warning system for patients at risk of ADHF. Project Narrative The proposed project will investigate how voice and speech production change in response to treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), which is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of fluid throughout the body. Excess fluid in the vocal folds and lungs is hypothesized to cause a number of changes in voice and speech, which can be detected with acoustic analysis of recordings from both a conventional microphone and a novel neck-skin vibration sensor. This research may provide clinicians and patients with a method of detecting impending ADHF earlier and more easily than is currently possible, which could save lives, reduce healthcare costs, and improve patients’ quality of life.",Acoustic speech analysis of patients with decompensated heart failure,9744304,F31HL143824,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diuresis', 'EFRAC', 'Edema', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Laryngeal Edema', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neck', 'Noise', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Speech', 'Speech Acoustics', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Voice', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'experience', 'improved', 'microphone', 'mortality', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'patient privacy', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sensor', 'treatment response', 'vibration', 'vocal cord', 'wearable sensor technology']",NHLBI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2019,32658,-0.09674245760679273
"Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) are at increased risk for numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, suicidality, substance use, HIV/AIDS, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Despite clear documentation and replication of these health disparities, relatively little is known about their development from adolescence into adulthood. Two theories primarily dominate the literature. Minority stress models describe unique life stressors experienced only by sexual minorities (e.g., victimization and discrimination based on sexual orientation) as primary contributors to health disparities. Other models implicate both minority stress and normative psychosocial processes together as contributors to health disparities. Some such normative processes include (1) psychological adjustment and characteristics (e.g., emotion regulation/dysregulation, substance use expectancies), (2) disrupted social systems (e.g., family, peers, school), and (3) individual differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, temperament). To date, most studies of both minority stress and normative processes are limited by use of cross-sectional samples of primarily Caucasian adults. Although much has been learned from these studies, they do not permit analysis of emerging health disparities across development. Existing research is therefore limited in terms of both generalizability to diverse populations, and validity of directionality inferences between observed ‘predictors’ and ‘outcomes’. My long-term career goals are to identify mechanisms leading to disparities among sexual minorities, with the goal of improving treatments for these disparities, and to develop screening tools to identify high-risk youth who would benefit from prevention programs. To reach this goal, in this project, I address existing limitations to the literature using a prospective sample of individuals who were 14-19 years old at baseline and followed for over 4 years. My goal is to describe developmental trajectories and mechanisms of health disparity development for sexual minority youth compared with heterosexual youth across a 10-year developmental window spanning ages 14- 23 years. Longitudinal outcomes include depression/anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, sleep, general physical health, disordered eating and substance use. Developmental trajectories for these outcomes will be charted by gender and sexual orientation. Confirmatory analyses based on existing literature will be conducted to examine relations between minority stress and adverse outcomes. Then, I will use machine learning to identify as-yet unknown predictors of adverse outcomes and health disparities and characterize any changes in prediction across time. Finally, I will use state-of-the art intervening variable analyses (mediation, moderation) to evaluate longitudinal mechanisms through which health disparities emerge. Findings should provide insight into mechanisms of disparity development and maintenance, informing prevention and intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) experience wide-ranging disparities in mental and physical health that often persist into adulthood, yet little is known about development of these disparities. This research (1) examines developmental trajectories in mental and physical health outcomes from adolescence to young adulthood among sexual minority and matched heterosexual youth, (2) uses advanced statistical methods (e.g., machine learning) to identify hypothesized and currently unknown factors that predict disparities over time, and (3) elucidates pathways to adversity and resilience. Experiences of sexual minority and heterosexual youth and young adults will be compared to uncover possible differences in developmental experiences that lead to health disparities, with possible implications for prevention and intervention among a highly vulnerable population.",Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing,9760277,F31MD014052,"['19 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Asthma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child Rearing', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Documentation', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expectancy', 'Family', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterosexuals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sex Orientation', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spirituality', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Victimization', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'emerging adult', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'non-heterosexual', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer victimization', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'resilience', 'sexual identity', 'sexual minority', 'sexual risk behavior', 'social', 'stressor', 'substance misuse', 'theories', 'treatment disparity', 'young adult']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,33183,-0.017612189528509414
"Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients Failure to rescue (FTR), a nurse-sensitive national metric of health care quality, refers to death of a hospitalized patient from a treatable complication, and is potentiated by failure to recognize and appropriately respond to early signs of complications. There is a paucity of research examining patient features predictive of FTR complications. Such information could shift the current paradigm of nursing surveillance to earlier recognition, prevention and treatment of FTR complications, thereby saving lives. New-onset venous thromboembolism (VTE), an FTR complication occurring as either a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE), is the leading cause of preventable hospital death, carrying a high risk of mortality and a national cost burden of $7 billion annually. VTE is a complex disease process involving interactions between clinical risk factors and acquired and/or inherited susceptibilities to thrombosis. Although biomarkers and clinical factors associated with VTE have been identified, clinical manifestations are subtle, presenting gradually over hours to days. Current VTE risk assessment models (RAM), the cornerstone of prevention, have limited utility due to their complexity and lack of reliability, generalizability and external validation. A critical gap in VTE risk modeling research is that while new-onset VTE pathology evolves over the course of hospitalization, no current models incorporate the progressive accrual of dynamic patient data and pattern evolution over time in their modeling approaches. The totality of routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data is massive in terms of volume, variety, and production at a rapid velocity in real-time. Such big data could be used in machine learning (ML) analytic approaches to process time series clinical data to identify subtle, evolving feature patterns predictive of new-onset VTE and address this gap. This study proposes to assemble a large scale, multi-source, multi-dimensional VTE study dataset, and in tandem, systematically define the EHR data elements associated with a new-onset VTE diagnosis for computable phenotype algorithm development. We will then apply machine learning analytic approaches to baseline and accruing intensive time series clinical data in the curated dataset to develop models identifying data patterns and features predictive of dynamically evolving new-onset VTE in adult hospitalized patients. This proposal aligns with NINR’s strategic vision for nurse scientists to employ new strategies for collecting and analyzing complex big data sets to permit better understanding of the biological underpinnings of health, and improve ways nurses prevent and manage illness. This innovative study and individualized training plan under a strong and well- established team, represents initial steps in the applicant’s research trajectory focused on data science approaches to predict FTR complication risk, and develop, implement and test dynamic RAMs to inform targeted prevention and treatment decisions. Discovering new knowledge informing real-time decision making, nursing surveillance practices and care delivery systems can improve nurse sensitive patient outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of preventable hospital death. This study first proposes to develop a reproducible computable phenotype definition for new-onset VTE cohort ascertainment from the electronic health record, and then develop dynamic models for VTE risk assessment through the application of machine learning algorithms to massive electronic health record clinical data repositories. Such models can inform the mechanisms underlying this complex disease and identify subtle pattern changes in a patient’s condition forecasting a VTE event, enabling earlier nurse identification and intervention, and decreasing the development of complications and failure to rescue in hospitalized patients.",Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients,9794015,F31NR018102,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Quality of Care', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Vision', 'base', 'care delivery', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multidimensional data', 'prevent']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2019,45016,0.013661080347870379
"Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke Project Summary Stroke is a highly heterogeneous and complex disease and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification of the cause of disease is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but can be difficult, as up to 35% of causes are undetermined by traditional subtyping criteria and very few causative genetic variants have been found. In addition, certain causes may be hidden within the clinical picture of a patient, such as an adverse drug reaction. Using data-driven approaches to analyze the medical records of patients may uncover novel patterns of risk factors and clinical features leading to stroke. The long-term goal of this research is to identify novel subtypes of highly heterogeneous diseases such as stroke and to reduce the genetic heterogeneity of a disease cohort by identifying patients with the same subtype. The objective of this application is to propose a pipeline that applies a data-driven analysis of medical notes to identify novel subtypes of stroke, focus on a subtype caused by an adverse drug reaction or drug pair interaction, validate the subtype in a genotyped study cohort, and look for gene variant enrichment in this cohort. This application’s central hypothesis is that applying deep learning to the electronic health record (EHR) of acute ischemic stroke patients will form subtypes based on more granular information than currently implemented and with reduced genetic heterogeneity by identifying novel patterns of risk factors and clinical picture leading to the stroke. In addition, we hypothesize that at least one subtype will identify patients whose stroke is an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction. To do this, Aim 1 will first identify all acute ischemic stroke patients in the EHR by developing a machine learning classifier trained on structured data in the EHR. Aim 2 will then build and train an unsupervised deep learning algorithm on text from medical notes to identify clusters, or subtypes, of patients with similar clinical pictures. Aim 3 will finally validate reduction in genetic heterogeneity of these cohorts by estimating observational heritability of all subtypes using a tool created in our lab and comparing this with the heritability estimates of subtypes derived from physician-based criteria. It will also focus on a not well-studied subtype, stroke due to an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction, by identifying its enrichment in the novel subtypes, validating this subtype in a study cohort with genotyped data, and finally looking for enrichment of pharmacogenetic variants in this subtype. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that identifies novel subtypes of acute ischemic stroke, enabling improved future genetic studies by reducing genetic heterogeneity of cohorts and improved understanding of the underlying causes of the disease. Project Narrative Stroke is a highly complex disease that is a leading cause of death and severe disability. Identifying the cause of stroke is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but up to a third of cases are of undetermined cause, and very few genetic variants have been identified due to the heterogeneity of the disease. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational pipeline that applies data-driven deep learning to medical notes to identify novel combinations of environmental, genetic, and medical risk factors causing the disease; this tool may clarify the etiology of unknown stroke cases, provide cohorts of patients enriched with similar genetic variants, and be expanded to subtype any disease.",Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke,9772123,F30HL140946,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Internet', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stroke', 'adverse drug reaction', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'falls', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'population based', 'random forest', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F30,2019,50016,-0.025593196864220496
"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Our goal is to rapidly and accurately identify pathogens and their resistance markers to facilitate accurate antimicrobial therapy, reducing antibiotic overuse in non-infected infants.",Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis,9794293,R01AI134982,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth Weight', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Dyes', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Exposure to', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Microbe', 'Modernization', 'Neonatal', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Very Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Viral', 'Whole Blood', 'Woman', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'circulating DNA', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'early onset', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'intrapartum', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'overtreatment', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic fungus', 'pathogenic virus', 'point of care', 'premature', 'rapid diagnosis', 'resistance gene', 'sample collection', 'septic', 'therapy resistant', 'viral detection']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,58207,-0.006744311928105701
"Medication plan concordance between patients and providers in COPD patients Project Summary/Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is projected to cost $50 billion in 2020 and is the 3rd leading cause of death in the US. Despite the association of poor adherence with higher mortality in COPD, there is poor adherence among COPD patients. COPD patients have 4 times the prevalence of mild to moderate cognitive impairment (MMCI) than non-COPD patients. Adherence is a vulnerable process and the presence of MMCI is associated with worse adherence. Additionally, 40% of patients with MMCI go unrecognized by providers. Adherence relies on effective patient-provider communication on the medication plan (medication, dose, frequency, and route) and patient understanding of the prescribed plan. The high prevalence of MMCI in COPD patients likely contributes to poor patient-provider communication, subsequent concordance, and ultimately poor adherence. Patient-provider communication as measured by concordance has yet to be studied or targeted for intervention. This study will leverage the ongoing observational Medication Adherence Research in COPD patients study (MARC Study R01- HL128620 PI Eakin) which is looking at the impact of adherence on health outcomes in COPD. Participants are over 40, carry a diagnosis of COPD with consistent spirometry (FEV1/FVC <70% and FEV1<80% predicted), and are on maintenance therapy for COPD. This proposal will capitalize on the MARC population by adding a sub-study of patient-provider concordance on medication plans and the influence of MMCI on such concordance. Concordance analysis will be conducted on pairs of patient and provider reported medication plans. MMCI will be measured by validated assessments including Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Weschler Memory Scale. Using logistic regression we will examine the impact of MMCI on concordance. A qualitative sub-study evaluating the impact of MMCI on patient-provider communication and concordance on medication plans will be conducted with the addition of semi-structured phone interviews with both patients and providers. Participants with and without MMCI and those concordant and discordant as well as their providers will complete semi structured interviews on the facilitators and barriers to patient-provider concordance and the impact of MMIC on communication and concordance. We expect to find that concordance among patients and providers is poor and the presence of MMCI is a barrier to concordance. The insight into patient and provider perceptions of adherence and communication will uniquely poise this study to inform the development of interventions aimed to improve patient-provider communication and subsequent adherence to medications. Project Narrative COPD has high cost and high morbidity and mortality, yet despite having interventions available to reduce morbidity and mortality adherence is poor. COPD patients have a higher than average presence of cognitive impairment, which has been shown to be associated with poor adherence. Communication between COPD patients and providers as measured by patient-provider concordance on medication plans has not previously been investigated and may provide insight into intervention development to improve communication and ultimately adherence.",Medication plan concordance between patients and providers in COPD patients,9820196,F32HL143864,"['Adherence', 'Behavior', 'CCL7 gene', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inhalators', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spirometry', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'patient-clinician communication', 'patient-level barriers', 'provider-level barriers', 'therapy development', 'treatment planning']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,60100,-0.0018196704218994776
"Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes Project Summary/Abstract The Hispanic population in the U.S. aged 65 and older has been growing rapidly and is projected to increase 5- fold between 2012 and 2050, when Hispanics are expected to make up more than 18% of the older adult population. Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. Disease diagnosis is often the basis for estimating prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in the population. People of Hispanic origin, however, are at greater risk of under diagnosis because of the unique challenges they face accessing and interacting with the health care system. The main objectives of the proposed project are two-fold: 1) to obtain estimates of hypertension and diabetes prevalence for different Hispanic subpopulations, defined by ethnic origin, nativity, and time in the U.S.; and 2) to determine how sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment interact to influence risk for hypertension and diabetes. Data for this project come from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which includes a large diverse sample of Hispanics, information on both disease diagnosis and direct assessments of disease risk, and contextual data on the social, economic, and health care environment. Multilevel modeling and logistic regression models will be used to: 1) examine the association between sociocultural factors and reported and measured disease prevalence; 2) determine if variation in health insurance and health care utilization accounts for Hispanic group differences in hypertension and diabetes; and 3) determine if variation in the sociomedical environment account for Hispanic differences in hypertension and diabetes. Results from the proposed project will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities. Project Narrative Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. This study will integrate multilevel information on sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment to advance understanding of the risks for developing hypertension and diabetes among older Hispanic populations. Results from the study will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities, and will inform interventions targeted at addressing disease burden to improve quality of life among Hispanics.",Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes,9616227,R36AG057949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Face', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Promotion', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Physical environment', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Puerto Rican', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'age related', 'burden of illness', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'health care availability', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'segregation', 'social', 'social disparities', 'socioeconomic disadvantage']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R36,2019,73946,0.00289744649795699
"Healthcare Impact of Consumer-Driven Atrial Fibrillation Detection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Companies are increasingly marketing mobile technologies as FDA-cleared medical devices, yet we do not know the consequences of these devices on healthcare utilization, cost, and outcomes. Recently, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 4 as an FDA-cleared medical device. The device includes an alert for the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and allows anyone to monitor their heart rhythm for the presence of AF. Apple has an enormous global audience, and the number of people who will use this (and other similar devices) to self-diagnose or monitor AF will be substantial. On one hand, the device may allow new diagnoses that result in treatment, improved quality of life, fewer AF related complications. On the other hand, the device may result in false positives in otherwise healthy people, resulting in more testing and treatments with associated harms. In fact, the U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends against routine surveillance for AF in the general population, citing lack of evidence and possible harm. We have an urgent need for a population-based infrastructure to ensure that technologies entering the market as medical devices are beneficial and safe.  The overall goal of this project is to measure the uptake and effect of the Apple Watch 4 release on healthcare utilization among first-time and known AF patients. Dr. Shah is an early stage investigator with a K08 Career Development Award from the NHLBI. As part of the K08, she has developed a detailed cohort of contemporary AF patients, including clinical notes. Along with a team, she will use real world data, as proposed by the FDA, to generate evidence about risks and benefits of consumer-driven AF detection. She will use natural language processing to leverage the notes and identify AF patients who seek care due to the medical device, and evaluate downstream healthcare utilization, such as additional clinic visits, cardioversions, additional remote monitoring, and cost. The goals of this project will be accomplished through the following Specific Aims: 1) Estimate the proportion of first-time AF patient visits attributable to a mobile device before and after FDA clearance of the Apple Watch 4, and characterize device accuracy and downstream healthcare utilization in this population; and 2) Evaluate healthcare utilization patterns among prevalent AF patients who use mobile devices with AF alerts.  In 2017, Apple sold 17.7 million smart watches, in a device market that continues to grow. Extrapolating from prior annual sales and conservatively assuming a 5% increase in users each year, almost 60 million people will have an Apple Watch by the end of 2020 (not accounting for non-Apple devices with similar functionality). Thus, even in this short period of time, uptake will be substantial and warrant immediate feedback.

"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",9807677,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injured', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2019,79000,0.009199208178556377
"BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study Patients increasingly survive critical care, but for many the experience is psychologically tormenting in part because they lose all control over their environment. Patients with neurological injury in particular suffer from this major loss of autonomy which impacts their long term recovery. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology transforms physiological changes associated with patient thoughts into actionable outputs. The technology is rapidly advancing and well established outside of the critical care setting. The goal of this project is to determine whether conscious and unconscious appearing ICU patients are able to communicate their basic needs, such as pain, hunger, and thirst, to health care providers using the BCI technology. We will apply a bedside BCI system in the ICU using a machine-learning algorithm that analyzes changes in routine EEG in response to standardized questions presented to the patient by headphones. The BCI system will provide immediate closed- loop feedback (auditory and/or visual) to patients about their performance. To achieve our goals, we will first test if conscious ICU patients are able to express basic needs, such as pain, to health care providers using the BCI technology. Patients will trigger the BCI system to then express their needs in response to specific questions (e.g., “Do you have pain?”). Secondly, we will determine whether basic communication is possible for patients with cognitive motor dissociation (i.e., patients who appear unconscious, but follow commands using EEG motor imagery paradigms). We will test if these patients are able to use the BCI system to respond to simple questions (i.e., “Activate the alarm”). Finally, we will assess the patient's experience using BCI technology as part of this study, as well as acceptance of using BCI technology in future clinical trials from patients, families, and health care providers involved in the study. The long-term goal of this proposal is to prepare a large clinical trial to test the benefits of BCI-assisted communication in brain-injured ICU patients. Patients in critical care suffer an almost complete loss of control over their most basic needs (e.g., they are unable to tell someone that they are hungry), which is stressful and impacts their long term recovery. This is a major problem for the many patients with acute brain injury. We propose to make technology available that would allow even some unresponsive‐appearing patients to communicate these needs with care givers and family members.",BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study,9808271,R03NS112760,"['Acute Brain Injuries', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Conscious', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Fever', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hunger', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patient Education', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Recovery', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Thirst', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'improved', 'injured', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized strategies', 'practical application', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sound', 'willingness']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2019,81000,-0.054574710561498575
"The Effectiveness of an Early Childhood Home Visiting Program to Reduce Child Maltreatment Project Summary We propose to examine the effectiveness of an early childhood home visiting program to reduce child maltreatment after dissemination to at-risk mothers in Connecticut, through analysis of administrative data. Child maltreatment has life-long impacts on children and is difficult to prevent, but there is evidence that home visiting can reduce maltreatment in the research setting. The effectiveness of home visiting in decreasing child maltreatment after dissemination to community settings is not well established. One challenge in evaluating maltreatment accurately is surveillance bias, which is the increased chance of a report that a family in the home visiting program has, compared to if they were not in the program. These extra reports are hypothesized to be for less severe situations. One way to assess maltreatment that avoids surveillance bias is to examine medical care for injuries, which can be considered a proxy measure for child maltreatment. Although many injuries are accidental, if one group has more injuries than another, this may be evidence that they either have a less safe environment (potential neglect) or have been physically abused. In Connecticut, approximately 40% of first-time mothers are screened for maltreatment risk each year for a voluntary home visiting program; this screening takes place in birth hospitals, through referrals from prenatal care providers, and other social services. Home visits take place for up to 5 years. We propose to examine child maltreatment by comparing families in the program to demographically-similar families who were not in the program. We will create a comparison group using birth certificate data from children born during the same time period, but not in the program for a variety of reasons (including program availability and not being screened). We utilized propensity score matching to identify similar families using demographic and health behavior data available from the birth certificates (such as neighborhood characteristics, adequate prenatal care, and maternal age). We have a sample of 4,886 program families and 23,904 comparison families. We will link these groups to both Child Protective Services (CPS) data and Medicaid/CHIP data to create 2 separate datasets. Using logistic regression and survival analysis with CPS data, we will compare investigated and substantiated reports; child removals from the home; and timing and severity of reports. Surveillance bias will be estimated using the difference-in-differences approach. Using logistic regression and the Medicaid/CHIP data, we will determine if injuries and injury-related hospitalizations are decreased in the program group. This project would lead to a better understanding of how to evaluate maltreatment in the context of home visiting. Project Relevance One goal of home visiting programs for new mothers is to reduce child abuse and neglect, a serious public health problem with life-long impacts on children. Although home visiting research trials have produced evidence for reductions in maltreatment, this evidence was mixed and few studies have examined these outcomes in community-replication sites. This project will examine the impact of a statewide home visiting program on child maltreatment, measured both by Child Protective Services determinations and by health care utilization for injuries.",The Effectiveness of an Early Childhood Home Visiting Program to Reduce Child Maltreatment,9773203,R03HD096114,"['Accidental Injury', 'Age', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Health', 'Communities', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maternal Age', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Policy Maker', 'Prenatal care', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Selection Bias', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Work', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'base', 'care providers', 'child protective service', 'community setting', 'comparison group', 'early childhood', 'health care service utilization', 'human subject', 'maltreatment', 'neglect', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'social']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,83750,-0.01775800375232965
"Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records Project Summary/Abstract This project proposes new methods for representing data in electronic health records (EHR) to improve pre- dictive modeling and interpretation of patient outcomes. EHR data offer a promising opportunity for advancing the understanding of how clinical decisions and patient conditions interact over time to inﬂuence patient health. However, EHR data are difﬁcult to use for predictive modeling due to the various data types they contain (con- tinuous, categorical, text, etc.), their longitudinal nature, the high amount of non-random missingness for certain measurements, and other concerns. Furthermore, patient outcomes often have heterogenous causes and re- quire information to be synthesized from several clinical lab measures and patient visits. The core challenge at hand is overcoming the mismatch between data representations in the EHR and the assumptions underly- ing commonly used statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. To this end, this project proposes novel wrapper-based methods for learning informative features from EHR data. Both methods propose specialized operators to handle sequential data, time delays, and variable interactions, and have the capacity to discover underlying clinical rules/decisions that affect patient outcomes. Importantly, both methods also produce archives of possible models that represent the best trade-offs between complexity and accuracy, which assists in model interpretation. These method advances are made possible by encoding a rich set of data operations as nodes in a directed acyclic graph, and optimizing the graph structures using multi-objective optimization. The central hypothesis of this research is that multi-objective optimization can learn effective data representations from the EHR to produce accurate, explanatory models of patient outcomes. Preliminary work has shown that these methods can effectively learn low-order data representations that improve the predictive ability of several state- of-the-art ML methods. This technique demonstrates good scaling properties with high-dimensional biomedical data. Aim 1 (K99) is to develop a multi-objective feature engineering method that pairs with existing ML methods to iteratively improve their performance by constructing new features from the raw data and using feedback from the trained model to guide feature construction. In Aim 2 (K99), this method is applied to form predictive models of the risk of heart disease and heart failure using longitudinal EHR data. The resultant models will be inter- preted with the help of mentors in order to translate predictions into clinical recommendations. For Aim 3 (R00), a second method is proposed that uses a similar framework to optimize existing neural network approaches in order to simplify their structure as much as possible while maintaining accuracy. The goal of Aim 4 (R00) is to identify hospital patients who are at risk of readmission and propose point-of-care strategies to mitigate that risk. This goal is facilitated through the application of the proposed methods to patient data collected from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, the Geisinger Health System, and publicly available EHR databases. Project Narrative  Understanding how clinical decisions interact with a patient's health and environmental over time to inﬂuence patient outcomes is central to the goals of enhancing health, reducing illness and improving quality of life. The proposed research provides important methodological advances for extracting these insights from widely available patient health records.",Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records,9744166,K99LM012926,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'University Hospitals', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'care costs', 'cluster computing', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder subtype', 'health record', 'heart disease risk', 'high dimensionality', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'readmission rates', 'readmission risk', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2019,89260,0.00378413645718081
"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9789060,R21MD012693,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consultations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Telemedicine', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Triage', 'Underserved Population', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'automated analysis', 'care delivery', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'ethnic minority population', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trend', 'two-dimensional']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2019,94263,0.0048623182459185885
"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,9623369,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable device']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2019,100000,-0.0075189414607602445
"A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Carotid artery atherosclerosis is a major vascular risk factor and accounts for approximately 15% of all strokes. A major risk marker in patients with carotid atherosclerosis has been the degree of narrowing, or stenosis, of the carotid artery lumen. While stenosis is often quantified via angiography, imaging can also provide detailed assessments of plaque. Our project is motivated by converging data that correlate vulnerable plaque elements, which can be captured with imaging, with increased stroke risk. Identifying high-risk or vulnerable carotid plaques before a stroke occurs is important because stroke prevention treatments, like carotid endarterectomy or stenting, carry risks and ideally should only be performed only those patients at highest risk of stroke. CTA (computed tomographic angiography) is an attractive tool for plaque imaging since it is not operator dependent, can be quickly performed, and is more widely available than MRI. Although CTA offers significant potential to evaluate these plaque features, small studies have not reached a consensus regarding their reliability and clinical relevance. In this project, we plan to explore the utility of CTA for the detailed carotid vessel wall imaging by employing a unique, large-scale clinical dataset and advanced algorithms. Our overarching objective in this R21 project is to conduct developmental and interdisciplinary research that will lay the foundation for the implementation and validation of novel CTA-based technologies that can be adopted in the risk stratification of patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Our central hypothesis is that there are CTA-based carotid plaque features that can be reliably extracted and used for stroke risk stratification, which will be more sensitive and specific than standard stenosis grading. To pursue our objective, we will pursue two specific aims: In Specific Aim 1 we plan to optimize the use of human reader defined plaque features in predicting culprit carotid plaques. We will perform a blinded, multi-reader study of CTA-derived carotid plaque features in a large scale clinical dataset to test the association between CTA-derived human-defined features and stroke, and compute accuracy metrics. In Specific Aim 2, we plan to develop algorithms to automatically characterize and discriminate culprit carotid plaque in CTA. We will implement and test image processing algorithms that automatically compute from a CTA scan stroke-associated carotid artery plaque features (from Aim 1), and then train a machine learning algorithm to distinguish culprit from asymptomatic carotid artery plaques. We believe that this R21 study is significant because it will establish a novel, machine learning-aided imaging strategy which can aid in identifying high-risk carotid artery plaques before they cause stroke and when they can be properly treated to prevent stroke from occurring in the future. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of novel and treatable vascular risk factors will ultimately improve risk factor screening and stroke prevention efforts, thereby reducing the incidence of a disabling and lethal disease. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NHLBI's mission that involves reducing the burden of vascular disease by fostering research on prevention.",A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis,9655181,R21HL145427,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Carotid Endarterectomy', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Carotid stent', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Statistical Models', 'Stenosis', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ulcer', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcification', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2019,121619,0.0073074124227063865
"Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures,9674530,K99MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive signature', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2019,128483,-0.015979898572939785
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9722280,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2019,129089,-0.0008071317812433588
"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9724447,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'econometrics', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness', 'supervised learning']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2019,130717,0.010885300190838927
"Schizophrenia Comorbidities: Common Genes and Clusters The vastly reduced life expectancy in schizophrenia is primarily due to medical comorbidities, yet these are often overlooked in a research context. Numerous psychiatric and somatic diagnoses have increased rates in schizophrenia, and the majority of schizophrenia patients have comorbid conditions. Since lifestyle factors and medication side-effects likely contribute to many of these increased medical problems, it has been difficult to resolve the extent to which shared biological underpinnings contribute to comorbid conditions. The aims for this proposal will be accomplished using data from the Genomic Aggregation Project in Sweden (GAPS) with >200k genotyped subjects and comprehensive medical and demographic information from the Swedish National Registers. This wealth of information allows for additional clinical risk from schizophrenia-associated variants to be captured. In Aim 1, carriers of previously identified schizophrenia risk variants without this diagnosis will be studied for increased risk of diagnoses across multiple psychiatric and somatic domains compared to non-carriers using logistic regression. Furthermore, comorbidities may offer clues to the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to different forms of schizophrenia. With this in mind, comorbid conditions will be leveraged to define schizophrenia subtypes in Aim 2 using the >5000 cases in the Swedish Schizophrenia Study within GAPS. Following cluster analysis using comorbidities, validity will be assessed by testing for group differences in genetic and clinical variation. These studies will yield new insights into the relationships between schizophrenia and other medical conditions, and identify subtypes of schizophrenia that will facilitate personalized medical care. Comorbidities are a fundamental feature of schizophrenia and may arise due to shared biological foundations, deleterious lifestyle factors or combinations of these influences. This study explores the origins of these comorbidities by studying the extent to which genetic risk for schizophrenia in unaffected individuals impacts risk for other psychiatric or somatic diagnoses. Furthermore, in a population with schizophrenia, patterns of comorbidity will be leveraged to identify subtypes with etiological and clinical significance.",Schizophrenia Comorbidities: Common Genes and Clusters,9696906,R21MH116188,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Carriers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Mind', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sweden', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'clinical care', 'clinical risk', 'clinically significant', 'cost effective', 'disorder subtype', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'pleiotropism', 'risk variant', 'side effect', 'societal costs']",NIMH,KAROLINSKA INSTITUTE,R21,2019,135778,-0.022402342766052425
"Changing Talk Online (CHATO): A Pragmatic Trial to Reduce Behavioral Symptoms in Dementia Care ABSTRACT  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk that is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. The next step to increase the impact of this effective classroom-based training is to test CHAT content provided in online internet modules. CHAT training Online (CHATO) can improve access for busy staff and those in rural and small NHs to increase dissemination across care settings to improve dementia care.  This R61/R33 study will develop and conduct a pragmatic clinical trial in response to PAR-18-585, Pragmatic Trials for Dementia Care I Long-term Services and Support (LTSS) Settings. We will test the effects of CHATO training on resident BPSD and psychotropic medication use in 120 NHs. In the R61 planning phase we will pilot test the online modules with NH staff to establish effects; recruit NH sites for the R33 trial; develop the clinical trial protocol, manual of operations, and data forms; develop data management, sharing, and fidelity assurance protocols; and obtain IRB approvals. A panel of NH administrators and staff will advise the team on recruitment strategies and a natural processing elderspeak feedback app will be tested in the clinical setting.  In R33 phase we will conduct the pragmatic trial in 120 NHs that will be randomly assigned to CHATO training or to the control group. BPSD and psychotropic medication rate data, extracted from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Nursing Home Compare and Minimum Data Set, will be compared using linear mixed modeling. NH strategies used to engage staff in CHATO (paid time off, recognition) and costs will be identified. The effects of a self-monitoring app that uses natural language processing to give staff immediate feedback on their elderspeak use will be tested. This research addresses NIA's milestones for nonpharmacological dementia care interventions, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease goal to enhance care quality and efficiency, and the Alzheimer's Association Plan to build a workforce with high-quality care skills. The goal of reducing inappropriate use of psychoactive medications to control BPSD using this nonpharmacological approach aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. NARRATIVE The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease has identified education of dementia care providers as a top priority to address the critical need for quality care for the population of persons with dementia that will triple in the next 30 years. This R61/R33 pragmatic clinical trial will test interactive online communication training for nursing home staff to reduce ineffective elderspeak communication, with anticipated reductions in behavioral symptoms and inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications in residents with dementia.

"Characterizing Prehospital Delay and Outcomes in Patients Treated for Potential Acute Coronary Syndrome in the Emergency Department Delayed treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) can be a matter of life or death. Each 30-minute increase in treatment delay raises the one-year mortality rate by 7.5%. The median patient prehospital delay time in presentation to the emergency department (ED) is more than two hours and has ranged from 1-24 hours, raising the risk of one year mortality up to an astounding 360% across studies. Emergent reperfusion targets (<90 minutes) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have been largely met with no resultant decrease in mortality suggesting that prehospital, rather than in-hospital delay, is contributing to poorer patient outcomes. In addition, ACS is associated with multiple debilitating symptoms, impaired functional status, repeat visits to the ED, and frequent healthcare utilization but inadequate attention has been paid to the relationship between prehospital delay (defined as time of symptom onset to arrival in the ED) and these patient outcomes. The objective of this secondary data analysis is to identify multiple, theory-based factors associated with prehospital delay and examine the association of prehospital delay with the outcomes of healthcare utilization and persistent symptoms. The sample includes patients presenting to the ED with symptoms that triggered an evaluation for possible ACS. Data from the prospective Think Symptoms study, whose main aim was to characterize the influence of gender on symptoms during ACS, will be used for analyses. The dataset includes a multiethnic sample of 1064 patients (400 women and 664 men) presenting to the ED with symptoms that triggered a cardiac evaluation. Data were collected in four academic and one non- academic medical center in four regions of the US. The dataset is unique in that it includes patients ruled-in for ACS and ruled-out for ACS as well as symptom data collected at presentation to triage, in the ED examination room, and one and six months following discharge. Specific aims of this study are to: 1) Identify predictors of prehospital delay for potential ACS by final diagnosis (ACS vs. no ACS) including patient factors, event factors, and transportation factors; 2) Determine the association between prehospital delay and one and six-month health care utilization and symptom outcomes by diagnosis (ACS vs. no ACS); and 3) Determine the relative contribution of patient, event, and transportation factors on patient outcomes attributable to prehospital delay. Multilinear and logistic regression modeling adjusting for relevant covariates will be used to address aims 1 and 2. Path analyses, a form of statistical equation modeling will be used to address aim 3. This novel work will provide models of patient factors influencing delay that will fill knowledge gaps and aid in the design of patient-centered interventions to reduce prehospital delay for ACS and improve patient outcomes. The outcome of this novel secondary analyses of data from the Think Symptoms study will be to advance science by providing data on the relationships between factors influencing prehospital delay and the potential impact on post-discharge patient outcomes. This analysis also has the potential to improve patient care since we will use our findings to develop new sex and age appropriate clinical interventions to improve outcomes by reducing treatment-seeking delay and improving symptom management for individuals at risk for, or previously diagnosed with, ACS.",Characterizing Prehospital Delay and Outcomes in Patients Treated for Potential Acute Coronary Syndrome in the Emergency Department,9953775,R21HL140277,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiac', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency medical service', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pre-hospitalization care', 'Recovery', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self Management', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Differences', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Triage', 'Undifferentiated', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'acute symptom', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'care seeking', 'critical care nursing', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'functional status', 'health care service utilization', 'impaired functional status', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'mHealth', 'men', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'persistent symptom', 'prospective', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'success', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'theories']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,137413,0.02007605122473298
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9701190,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2019,139614,-0.0038247070407263412
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes. This proposal will provide mentored research training to use predictive modeling to improve early diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, and test the delivery of clinical decision support to clinicians through the electronic health record in an implementation trial. This proposal responds to the AHRQ priorities of improving health care quality through use of information systems, improving safety and quality of care by synthesizing and communicating evidence to health care professionals, advances knowledge generation in a learning health system and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs.",Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED),9747879,K08HS025696,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K08,2019,148539,0.010314312570295246
"Objective Evaluation of Variation in Sepsis Incidence, Mortality, and Care PROJECT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a leading cause of death, disability, and cost to the healthcare system. Increasing recognition of the devastating burden of sepsis has prompted national performance improvement initiatives and efforts to benchmark the quality of sepsis care. However, efforts to track sepsis incidence, outcomes, and quality have been hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance tools. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has thus led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records (EHRs) using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction. He has demonstrated that this method is less susceptible to changing diagnosis and coding practices over time than administrative claims data, the traditional method of surveillance, and can be applied to diverse EHR systems in different healthcare systems. The overall goal of this proposal is to build on this work to improve the ability of researchers, clinical organizations, and policy makers to evaluate variation in sepsis incidence, outcomes, and care and thus identify targets for improvement and inform better prevention and treatment strategies. These themes fit with AHRQ's mission to improve health care quality and patient safety, and are reflected in the Specific Aims: 1) Develop and validate a disease severity prediction model for risk-adjustment of sepsis outcomes based on data routinely captured in electronic health records, 2) Evaluate interhospital and intrahospital unit-level variation in sepsis incidence and outcomes using objective EHR-data versus claims codes and identify factors associated with worse outcomes, and 3) Evaluate the impact of lactate testing on clinical outcomes in patients with suspected sepsis. This project will leverage “big data” with granular clinical information from more than 200 academic and community hospitals and 4 million inpatient encounters, providing the capacity to adjust for multiple confounders, analyze important patient subgroups, and make robust conclusions that are widely generalizable to the nation. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, MD, MPH, is a junior faculty member in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a dual-certified critical care and infectious disease physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital. This K08 proposal will capitalize on Dr. Rhee's rich clinical background, foundational training in epidemiology, biostatistics, and public health, and previous research experience with sepsis epidemiology and surveillance using EHR clinical data. Dr. Rhee's immediate goals during this award period are to 1) acquire skills in using “big data” in healthcare and handling missing data, 2) learn advanced methods in prediction modeling and mixed-effects logistic regression, 3) learn propensity score analysis and comparative effectiveness research skills, 4) improve communication, research leadership, and grant writing skills, and 5) participate in ongoing training in ethical research conduct. These goals will be accomplished through a combination of active mentoring; formal didactic coursework; immersive research training; practical experience; and collaborations with internationally recognized sepsis and infectious disease experts, public health officials, and the Hospital Corporation of America, the largest inpatient private healthcare system in the world. Throughout the K08 award period, he will continue to establish himself as a national thought leader on sepsis epidemiology, surveillance, and quality while preparing for his transition to independence. Dr. Rhee's multidisciplinary and experienced mentorship team, combined with the superb research environment of the Harvard Medical School Department of Population Medicine, provides the support and training experience necessary to achieve his long-term goal of becoming an independently funded health services researcher focusing on using big data to improve disease surveillance, prevention, and quality of care for sepsis and infections in critically ill patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE   The devastating burden of sepsis on our society has prompted national performance improvement initiatives, but efforts to measure sepsis rates, outcomes, and quality of care are hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance methods.  The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction rather than administrative claims codes, which are prone to variability in diagnosis and coding practices and changing billing incentives over time.

"Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases PROJECT SUMMARY  Care delivery at primary and urgent clinics is critically hindered by doctor shortage, time constraints and the inappropriate use of infrastructures. Rising aging population and unhealthy lifestyle are expected to drive the increase of chronic disease and the national health expenditures associated (20% of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025). Telemedicine has been proposed as a possible solution to reduce the cost of access to care minimizing the dependence of patients on health professionals. However, current solutions that connect patients with doctors don’t allow accurate diagnosis due to the lack or inappropriate use of medical devices. AdviNow proposes to implement computer vision to offer a clinically reliable approach to perform self- evaluation of vital parameters. AdviNow will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms that will guide any non-trained people to a correct usage of Class 2 medical devices at the point of need. The new approach will represent the core component of a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) which will be integrated into telemedicine platforms, kiosks or any medical office to automate medical visits, improving chronic diseases management.  In this Phase I application, we will develop a minimally viable application based on heart stethoscope exams, in order to assess the feasibility of the proposed approach for multiple medical devices to effectively monitor chronic diseases. Specific activities will include: (1) Development of AR-driven engine for the correct application of heart stethoscope; (2) development of a basic front-end application for Real-time instructions; (3) establishment of a classifier for heart sound abnormalities. We expect to achieve real-time (<300ms) estimation of phonocardiogram key points and accurate validation of the stethoscope position based on camera-capture and audio-recorded data. We expect that our system will recognize normal and abnormal heart sounds with >85% accuracy. Finally, a small feasibility test will be performed with healthy volunteers to verify their ability to position the stethoscope in less than 10 seconds with an error of less than one inch.  The successful completion of this SBIR Phase I project will lay the foundation of a Phase II SBIR proposal for an external validation of the system to be performed in collaboration with urgent care clinics and patients affected by chronic heart conditions. The mission of AdviNow Medical is to develop a disruptive solution for the delivery of healthcare that is safe, effective, timely, efficient, and available in centralized and decentralized locations. By reducing the time for routine analysis, the actual doctor-patient encounter will be more meaningful, improving the clinical outcome as well as patient satisfaction. This invention promises to disrupt healthcare, as providers will improve cost management and profitability by visiting more patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE New strategies for accurate and efficient delivery of healthcare to chronic disease patients are required. This project will develop the first Augmented Reality (AR) algorithms which will guide patients to use Class 2 medical devices for self-assessment of vital parameters to monitor the health status of chronic conditions. The project is expected to introduce a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) to Primary and Urgent care clinics and remote settings to allow improved medical outcomes and cost management of chronic diseases.",Development of an automated healthcare system for effective management of patients with chronic diseases,9778356,R43NR018631,"['Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Augmented Reality', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease Management', 'Drops', 'Ear', 'Environment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Sounds', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Joints', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research Personnel', 'Self Assessment', 'Self-Examination', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging population', 'base', 'care delivery', 'clinical decision support', 'computational intelligence', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'invention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'software development', 'sound', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'urgent care']",NINR,"ADVINOW, INC.",R43,2019,149999,0.0059481375018791294
"Mobile-phone integrated rapid diagnostic tests to improve antibiotic stewardship PROJECT SUMMARY  An estimated 1.4 billion antibiotic prescriptions were filled in the US from 2000-2010. Despite a national antibiotic education campaign, approximately 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result of the over-prescription of antibiotics, there is a current and pressing public health need for improved antibiotic stewardship. Compounding this problem are new modalities of healthcare like telemedicine that, while meeting patient demand for convenience, have been shown to have higher antibiotic prescription rates. As a result, there is a pressing need for a tool that these remote providers can use to distinguish between bacterial infections, where antibiotics can be effective, and viral infections where antibiotics are unneeded.  In this research, we propose the development of Barcode Embedded Rapid Diagnostics (BERDs) as a point-of-care test to measure a host biomarker signature in response to an infection in blood. These tests have novel spatial patterning of reagents that allows them to automatically and quantitatively be analyzed by a mobile phone application. Once the biomarkers have been analyzed on the test, a clinical decision support engine developed in this proposal will provide a confident diagnosis.  We have assembled an interdisciplinary consortium that consists of biomedical engineering, point-of-care device, and software development expertise through PragmaDx, Inc., and biomarker assay development in the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University. To meet our shared goals, our specific aims will: optimize manufacturing conditions of BERDs, develop and evaluate a machine learning clinical decision support engine, and rigorously compare the performance of BERDs to standard clinical laboratory methods using de-identified patient specimens.  A successful outcome of this Phase I STTR will be the development of a diagnostic test and clinical decision support engine that is capable of measuring multiple biomarkers in blood to differentiate the etiology of an infection at the point-of-care, with accuracy comparable to standard clinical laboratory assays. Upon completion of this effective demonstration, the platform will be ready for a large-scale clinical evaluation that will be the subject of a Phase II application. PROJECT NARRATIVE  An estimated 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result, antibiotic resistance has developed into a major public health concern.

"Lightweight optoimpedance sensors enabling early detection of the physiological response to injury and illness Abstract Early detection of ongoing hemorrhage (OH) before onset of shock is a universally acknowledged great unmet need, and particularly important after trauma. Delays in the detection of OH are associated with a “failure to rescue” and a dramatic deterioration in prognosis once the onset of clinically frank shock has occurred. While uniplex noninvasive technologies have failed to detect or diagnose complex disease states, we have demonstrated the superiority of multiplex approaches in silico. The goal of this STTR project is to develop a commercially viable optoimpedance sensor-based system that combines state-of-the-art noninvasive sensing technologies and advanced multivariable statistical algorithms. Phase I will involve three Aims: 1) D​esign, Fabricate and Test Opto-Impedance oPiic sensors, 2) Develop of Mobile App, Data and ML Pipeline on Secure Cloud, and 3) Evaluate oPiics on an Unanesthetized Upright Porcine Hemorrhage Model. By derisking the hardware challenges, we will be well-positioned for a Phase II application to optimize oPiic design and manufacturing, fold-in predictive algorithms under current development with DOD support, and validate with a clinical trial in critical care setting. Project Narrative We have demonstrated that a multiplex approach is superior to predicting shock compared to single clinical devices alone. During a mass-casualty event, a predictive tool would need to be deployed widely, since only a fraction of individuals will have ongoing hemorrhage that will progress to decompensated shock. Optical and bioimpedance signals are critical indicators of muscle hemodynamics and electrolyte balance likely to be modified in the period leading up to shock. No commercial device exists that provides continuous, low-power, low-cost monitoring of these signals with characteristics suitable for integration with the multiplexing approach. This STTR application seeks Phase I funding to commercialize an opto-impedance sensor, called the ‘oPiic’, that will address this unmet need.",Lightweight optoimpedance sensors enabling early detection of the physiological response to injury and illness,9909081,R41EB029284,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolyte Balance', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Fiber Optics', 'Funding', 'General anesthetic drugs', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Metabolism', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Muscle', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Vertebrates', 'analog', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electric impedance', 'electrical property', 'hemodynamics', 'instrument', 'light weight', 'mass casualty', 'member', 'miniaturize', 'mobile application', 'optical sensor', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'performance tests', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive tools', 'preservation', 'programs', 'response', 'response to injury', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tissue oxygenation', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,"MULTIVARIATE SYSTEMS, INC.",R41,2019,155282,0.001096147212841353
"Improve medical decision making in emergency medicine via a new interface to visualize and understand relevant prior history for complex patients at the point-of-care. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Patient Insight is working to drive more informed medical decisions by designing a real-time interface that dynamically captures and presents prior history for complex patients in less time and with more completeness than using their electronic health record (EHR) system. The company is developing proprietary data mining and natural language processing algorithms that show promise for identifying, aggregating, and displaying the most essential EHR data for patients with complex conditions while at the same time working with clinicians to design the visual interface to reduce the cognitive burden and support diagnosis and treatment decisions. The specific goals of this phase I project are to test the feasibility of developing Patient Insight’s core solution to (1) use advanced analytics and natural language processing to mine and prioritize the most relevant information for use by (ED) physicians and (2) develop an clinician-informed, visual display of that essential information to timely support clinical decision-making sufficient to reduce medical errors, improve health, and control costs. In phase I, Patient Insight will work with Universal Health Systems, the parent company of George Washington University Hospital, to co-develop and test the platform for efficacy in the ED as a precursor to continued development of this core solution/product. This will involve using EHR data to assess comprehensiveness to reconstruct history for five groups of chronically ill patients (e.g., advanced cancer, coronary heart disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, chronic pain, and schizophrenia) who are admitted with high-frequency chief complaints of abdominal pain, chest pain, and fever. This will include mining, prioritizing, and presenting information to clinicians using a total of 30 dimensions of data regarding patient’s prior ED and hospital visits including both structured (e.g., diagnosis, medications, labs, imaging test types, EKG date/time) and unstructured data (e.g., images, physician notes, consult notes) to establish physician consensus on the data most valuable to medical decision-making and co-design data visualization tools to render a clear patient history. Our aims include: (Aim 1) Establishing the feasibility of leveraging provider-as-user-centered design to guide development of a data visualization platform that enables providers to readily “see” the most complete patient record for the five groups of complex patients, and (Aim 2) Conducting usability testing and compare the completeness and efficiency of using the enhanced platform on the five patient categories with usual care. Success in phase I will enable the company to validate a ‘proof of concept’ for developing its clinician-as-user-centered design process to inform a phase II research and development effort to design a commercially viable clinical decision support tool for hospitals and health systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patient Insight seeks to determine the feasibility of its proposed platform to aggregate and present the clearest picture possible of a patient’s history for time-constrained emergency department (ED) providers sufficient to drive improved medical decision-making, safety, and improved health outcomes for complex patients at the point-of-care and across disparate EHR systems. The strategy is to leverage our capability to extract discreet and unstructured data from select EHR systems and engage providers in the design of key elements of information display to reduce duplicate testing, lower medical errors related to misinformed treatment choices, and reduce unnecessary treatment and costs. Proving feasibility will enable Patient Insight to structure a partnership with Universal Health Services and inform further development and testing of its core solution across multiple ED facilities.",Improve medical decision making in emergency medicine via a new interface to visualize and understand relevant prior history for complex patients at the point-of-care.,9778547,R43LM013130,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronically Ill', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Consult', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cost Control', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intuition', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical History', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Schizophrenia', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Washington', 'Work', 'chronic pain', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive load', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'information display', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'point of care', 'research and development', 'stem', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment choice', 'unnecessary treatment', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NLM,"PATIENT INSIGHT, INC.",R43,2019,155520,-0.03728746124678177
"Understanding Inflammatory Arthritis due to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Project Summary/Abstract The major goals of this proposal are to attain skills required to be an independent clinical and translational researcher in rheumatology and to enhance understanding of a new rheumatic disease, inflammatory arthritis (IA) due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs are revolutionizing cancer treatment but also cause immune related adverse events. ICI-induced IA is the immune related adverse event most likely to be encountered by rheumatologists. ICI-induced IA causes significant morbidity, is clinically heterogeneous, and can persist after ICI cessation. The proposed project will utilize a group of well characterized patients with ICI- induced IA and ICI-treated control patients who do not develop IA to address several important questions. First, the clinical heterogeneity within ICI-induced IA will be evaluated and factors that predict persistence of IA beyond cessation of ICI therapy will be established. Next, clinical and immunogenetic risk factors for developing ICI-induced IA will be determined. Finally, serum cytokine profiles and autoantibodies before and after ICI treatment will be compared in patients with ICI-induced IA and control patients who are treated with ICIs and do not develop IA. These experiments will address key knowledge gaps for this emerging clinical entity. Specifically, defining relevant clinical subgroups will allow for differential monitoring and treatment of patients. Understanding risk factors for development of IA will allow for risk stratification of patients prior to therapy. Cytokines that are elevated in ICI-induced IA patient sera could serve as future therapeutic targets. Finally, understanding presence of autoantibodies and when they develop in the course of ICI treatment will give insight into pathogenesis and identify potential biomarkers. Concurrently with conducting research during the proposal, the candidate will participate in a variety of career development activities taking advantage of the rich resources of Johns Hopkins in the Division of Rheumatology, the Bloomberg Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. The candidate will participate in didactic coursework, conferences, and mentoring meetings with a diverse group of mentors from rheumatology, oncology, laboratory science, and data science. At the end of this award, the candidate will be an independent clinical investigator in the area of cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune disease and will establish a multi- center consortium with standardized data and biospecimen collection for rheumatic irAEs and for patients with preexisting autoimmune disease who are treated with ICIs. Project Narrative This project addresses an increasingly prevalent health condition, inflammatory arthritis due to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for cancer.

"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9785384,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2019,158220,0.014082200190296839
"Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings Project Summary (Abstract) With little change in incidence for over 50 years, pneumonia remains the top cause for morbid hospitalization1 in the USA, and is associated with healthcare costs exceeding $10 billion annually2. This study proposes to mine big data captured in an intergrated medical/dental record (iEHR) and enterprise data warehouse (EDW) of a large midwestern medical-dental integrated healthcare system and will test the hypothesis that poor oral health is an independent risk for subtypes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Proposed specific aims include: 1) electronic identification and characterization of pneumonia types and 2) evaluation of the association of oral health status with risk of pneumonia. Tasks to achieve study aims are to: a) develop electronic, phenotype-based algorithm(s) to classify and characterize pneumonia by subtype and relative frequency of events; b) characterize impact of immediate and longitudinal oral health status on emergent pneumonia stratified by subtype; and c) evaluate relative risk contributed by medical and dental factors. Innovative application of natural language processing (NLP) to support evaluation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML) to identify as-yet unknown potential risk factors is proposed. These aims will be accomplished by established investigators including dentists and researchers with extensive research track records in oral and systemic health including pneumonia, clinical pulmonologist/intensivist to provide clinical expertise to inform data mining, biomedical informaticians with expertise in data mining, ML and NLP and data modeling, and experienced biostatisticians who will apply appropriate statistical approaches and traditional data modeling to big data. This team will collaboratively create and deliver a unique, well-defined, pneumonia- specific, oral health data registry resource and validated phenotype-based algorithm to classify pneumonia, stratified by subtypes, which will support future interrogation for additional permutations of medical and dental factors. Study outcomes are expected to leverage immediate translational value within the health system with high potential for relevance and portability to other settings. The project is expected to define risk factors which may represent actionable targets for reduction of pneumonia risk across various settings. Project Narrative- Relevance to public health: Pneumonia continues as a leading public health problem in hospitals, healthcare facilities and community settings. Pneumonia is the top disease-related cause for hospitalization. This study proposes to use data in electronic health records to classify pneumonia type and describe risk factors that may make individual susceptible to different types of pneumonia, including impact of diseases of the mouth, gums and teeth. The project expects to create models that can identify patients at risk for pneumonia based on information in their medical record so that those risks may be recognized and reduced.",Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings,9784789,R03DE027020,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Climate', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Hygiene', 'Dental Records', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Mouth Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nosocomial pneumonia', 'Oral', 'Oral health', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Periodontitis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal vaccine', 'Pneumonia', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Ventilator', 'Visit', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'case finding', 'clinically relevant', 'community setting', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outreach', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'pneumonia model', 'portability', 'secondary analysis', 'systems research', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia']",NIDCR,MARSHFIELD CLINIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION,R03,2019,159914,-0.009515331378157705
"Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization Project summary Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health and criminal justice problem that negatively impacts millions of victims yearly in the United States, primarily women (85%). Most IPV-related healthcare visits (83%) occurred in an emergency department (ED), and these clinical encounters are unique opportunities to identify IPV victims and potentially provide assistance. Although numerous health professional organizations have endorsed universal screening and counseling for IPV since 1992, actual screening rates, detection of IPV victims, and referrals to IPV services remain low in the ED. As a result, many IPV victims pass through the ED unidentified and untreated. Computerized screening tools have been developed and implemented in clinical settings in order to assist providers in screening and detecting IPV. However, these tools have a great limitation in that they rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHR). Recently, researchers demonstrated that a history of IPV diagnoses and associated clinical symptoms highly predict current and future IPV (OR=7.8), and these important IPV data could serve as red flags that trigger providers to assess patients further for IPV. In order to enhance IPV screening in the ED, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summarizer that extracts, abstracts and synthesizes patient historical IPV data (structured and unstructured), and delivers patient historical IPV data to ED providers through an intuitive interface. The specific aims are: 1) develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) strategies to identify and extract patient historical IPV incidents and timelines from clinic notes; 2) develop and evaluate a web service-based summary tool (IPV-Summary-Service) that synthesizes patient- specific IPV information from both NLP-processed data elements and structured data; and 3) develop and pilot test an enhanced IPV screening strategy that delivers clinical evidence generated by the IPV-Summary- Service through a specific EHR (Epic) to providers during the patient universal IPV screening in the ED. This automatic clinical date summary for IPV will be piloted in one ED at MUSC. There are two major outcomes to be measured for the IPV-Summary enhanced screening for 6 months before and after the index date of pilot testing: 1) rate of successful referral to the IPV 24-hour dedicated IPV nurse; and 2) rate of initiation of referral and identification of persons at high risk of IPV. We will use mixed effect generalized linear regression models to estimate the effects of IPV-Summary on the referral rate and IPV case identification rate. Through survey studies, we will assess secondary outcomes including factors of system feasibility, usability, and providers' satisfaction. These analyses can identify potentially important correlates of the major outcomes and may help us improve the design of the intervention. The results from this study will form the foundation for a broader implementation in a regional health information exchange for EDs. Narrative Computer-based approaches for intimate partner violence (IPV) universal screening have led to significantly higher screening rate and detection rate, as well as receipt of IPV services in the emergency department (ED). However, these approaches rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal IPV data existing in electronic health records (EHR), which have high predictive power of IPV risk. In order to enhance the effectiveness of IPV screening, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summary tool that extracts, abstracts, and synthesizes patient historical IPV information from EHR and then delivers that critical information to ED providers at the point of care.",Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization,9739347,R21LM012945,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Event', 'Face', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Professional', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Violent injury', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'intimate partner violence', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability', 'web services']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2019,168188,-0.011641809681371516
"Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Michael Mathis is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology and advanced perioperative echocardiography at the University of Michigan. Through completion of a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr. Mathis has developed expertise in perioperative outcomes research for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease. His long-term career goal is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF) through harnessing perioperative electronic healthcare record (EHR) data for early diagnosis and management. This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance Statement: Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting over 550,000 patients each year, with a 45–60% mortality rate at 5 years. Despite advances in treatment, little progress has been made to improve heart failure diagnosis, and thus patients in early heart failure stages do not receive appropriate life-extending therapies. Through robust data science methodologies, this study harnesses critically underutilized, high-fidelity data available during the perioperative period to improve diagnosis of heart failure .",Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach,9682500,K01HL141701,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Blood Pressure', 'Board Certification', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2019,172137,0.005124359876461992
"SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in technology, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare costs in the U.S. Yet, there is a tremendous gap in accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in CVD risks and outcomes for disaggregated Hispanic and Asian subgroups. The current cardiovascular risk assessment tools have not been well-validated in these diverse populations, and it remains largely unknown why minority patients are less likely to start and more likely to stop life-saving therapies. The overall goal of Dr. Rodriguez’s K01 application is to address gaps in knowledge about CVD prediction and treatment in understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. The proposed study will utilize the electronic health record (EHR) data from an established NHLBI-funded cohort enriched with disaggregated Hispanic and Asian patients. Using this cohort, Dr. Rodriguez will first test the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups using a large diverse mixed-payer cohort of 1,234,751 patients from two large healthcare systems in Northern California and Hawaii. Secondly, she will build new CVD risk prediction models for diverse patient subgroups using machine learning techniques. Finally, she will identify reasons for statin underuse and discontinuation using natural language processing in the EHR. This study, which will evaluate existing data from real-world clinical practice in a stable population, will inform future risk prediction models and cholesterol treatment guidelines for diverse racial/ethnic groups. The proposal is aligned with the NHBLI’s strategic goals to eliminate health disparities and inequities by leveraging epidemiology and data science to understand and solve complex health problems. This proposal will also prepare Dr. Rodriguez to meet her long-term goal of becoming a national leader and independent investigator in CVD prevention and minority health. The proposed didactic and applied data science experiences, including training in advanced epidemiological methods and machine learning, will prepare Dr. Rodriguez to apply her research to other areas of CVD prevention and populations. This training program builds on the strengths of Stanford University in health services research, epidemiology, and biomedical informatics. Her mentorship team, led by Dr. Latha Palaniappan, includes experts in cardiovascular prevention and health services research (Dr. Heidenreich, co-mentor), applied statistical analyses (Dr. Robert Tibshirani, advisor), machine learning in the EHR (Dr. Nigam Shah, advisor), and chronic disease prediction and medical decision making (Dr. Michael Pignone, advisor). Dr. Rodriguez’s team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal as well as overseeing her advanced training in their respective areas of expertise. The research and training plan proposed in this K01 application will develop Dr. Rodriguez into a unique and highly-skilled clinician researcher ready to compete for R-level funding and launch her independent research career. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S., yet current CVD risk prediction algorithms fail to adequately assess risk in these populations. The proposal will address this substantial knowledge gap by validating current risk prediction models in racial/ethnic minority subgroups, improving risk prediction using modern machine learning techniques, and identifying reasons for statin discontinuation. Findings from this study will provide the foundation for clinical guidelines, research agendas, and public health interventions to improve CVD prevention strategies in diverse populations. !",SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups),9645316,K01HL144607,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mexican Americans', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Puerto Rican', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'South Asian', 'Stable Populations', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'college', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'epidemiologic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health difference', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevention service', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'random forest', 'risk prediction model', 'side effect', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,172692,-0.017527045022401225
"Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI) Project Summary/Abstract  Substance misuse is inconsistently addressed in routine medical practice. Primary care physicians frequently fail to diagnose substance abuse when presented with early symptoms of alcohol or drug use. Patients report that less than one-third of primary care physicians carefully screen them for substance abuse, in spite of available and effective screening protocols. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an integrated, evidence-based approach aimed at delivering early intervention for drug and alcohol misuse in medical settings and has been demonstrated to reduce substance misuse. Motivational Interviewing (MI), an underlying component of SBIRT, is an evidence-based, brief interventional approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors. Unfortunately, the MI approach is very difficult to teach to practitioners as it is counterintuitive to most providers who commonly take a directive approach with patients. Because of ineffective training, MI and SBIRT are under-utilized.  The primary goal of this project is to transform MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that analyzes practitioner responses and gives immediate feedback to improve MI skills. Our team has been developing and testing a training tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI). ReadMI is a low cost, ultra-portable solution for accurate and automatic real-time assessment of dialog during the course of MI training. It makes use of the latest advances in deep-learning-based speech recognition and mobile and cloud computing technologies to enable instantaneous MI training assessment and analysis. Currently functioning with 92% accuracy, ReadMI provides immediate feedback to MI and SBIRT trainees regarding the number of open- and closed-ended questions asked, provider-vs-patient conversation time, and other integral components of MI.  ReadMI will advance the skill development of physicians and other healthcare professionals in their use of MI and SBIRT, minimizing the need for time-consuming reviews of recorded training sessions. Our aims are: 1) develop ReadMI to provide MI training metrics with 95% accuracy and 2) test ReadMI in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 200 medical students and residents, 100 who will receive SBIRT/MI training with ReadMI and 100 who will serve as the control group, receiving customary SBIRT/MI training.  The prospective applications of ReadMI extend far beyond substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, detection, and intervention. The effectiveness of all chronic disease management is largely dependent on patient behavior. MI is a patient-focused conversation between the provider and the patient that reinforces the patient's motivation to make positive changes in health-related behavior. By making efficient MI training available to more health professionals, ReadMI will improve healthcare quality as providers are better equipped in their efforts to help patients make healthy lifestyle changes. Project Narrative Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors, including substance misuse. However, MI and a specific application of MI to substance misuse known as SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) are underutilized because of inadequate training of health professionals. This research aims to revolutionize MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that uses natural language processing to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI).",Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI),9824096,R21HS026548,[' '],AHRQ,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,174994,0.0003760157547048314
"Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions Project Summary/Abstract Atrial Fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and accounts for roughly 15% of all strokes in the United States. Many individuals may have undiagnosed AF whose arrhythmia does not prompt evaluation either because of minimal symptoms or brief episodes. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is highly effective at reducing stroke risk in patients with AF, but is only prescribed to individuals with recognized disease. Identifying subjects with undiagnosed AF is important so they may be treated with OAC and prevent strokes from occurring. This project will help advance our knowledge of screening patients for undiagnosed AF in the primary care setting by identifying patients at high risk of developing AF for targeted clinic and home-based screening strategies. Fundamental questions of who to target and how to implement a screening program in the United States remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic and content area training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To identify predictors of AF incidence from electronic health record structured and free-text data, 2) To develop and implement an electronic algorithm that improves upon existing models to identify patients at increased risk for AF in a primary care population, and 3) To implement and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of a clinic and home-based screening program to identify undiagnosed AF. This project aligns with several objectives of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Strategic Vision by implementing novel diagnostic tools to diagnose AF and prevent strokes, by optimizing clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease, and leveraging emerging opportunities in data science, through the use of natural language processing of text data in the electronic health record, to improve identification of patients at high risk for AF. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in cardiovascular disease and targeting populations for prevention of cardiovascular disease events. Career development activities include training in biomedical informatics, data mining and risk prediction, survey research design, implementation research, and cardiovascular disease pathophysiology and clinical management through formal coursework, clinical shadowing, as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will improve prediction of which patients are at the highest risk of developing AF, and evaluate how to use this risk information to implement an effective screening strategy in primary care. Pilot data from this award will lay the groundwork for a highly competitive application for NIH R01 funding. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke and the prevalence is estimated to increase from 5.2 million adults in the United States to more than 12 million by 2030, however, many additional individuals have undiagnosed disease. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, by 1) improving identification of patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation, and 2) targeting patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation in the primary care setting with an efficient strategy for clinic and home-based screening. This program will significantly increase knowledge of how to overcome the real-world issue of how to effectively and efficiently screen for atrial fibrillation in clinical practice.",Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions,9806592,K01HL148506,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Senior Scientist', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data registry', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient screening', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk minimization', 'screening', 'screening program', 'stroke risk', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2019,176990,0.00981906723778816
"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.'s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group's online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH's focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, but less than 20% of individuals receive treatment. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” for increasing mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders, with study data being used to optimize the chatbot for a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",9806002,K08MH120341,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exposure to', 'Facebook', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Participant', 'Partnership Practice', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Services', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'chatbot', 'computer program', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health service use', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'service delivery', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'success', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'web site']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2019,179096,0.00405769261871715
"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response. These are critical steps toward improving infant health outcomes through both targeted treatment of infection and reduced unnecessary early-life antibiotic exposures.",Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood,9744005,K23AI139337,"['Acute-Phase Proteins', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood Proteins', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fetal Development', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Haptoglobins', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Infant Health', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Mycoses', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal Infection', 'Placenta', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Sepsis', 'Serum Proteins', 'Serum amyloid A protein', 'Set protein', 'Side', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adverse outcome', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'differential expression', 'early onset', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fetal', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant morbidity', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbiome alteration', 'neonatal infection', 'neonatal outcome', 'neonatal sepsis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'research and development', 'research study', 'sex', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational research program']",NIAID,LURIE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO,K23,2019,189432,-0.0022981362403605007
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9983413,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality risk', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic patients', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2019,190216,0.02878273063571022
"SPEEKO for Elderspeak: A Self-Monitoring App to Improve Communication and Reduce Behavioral Symptoms in Care for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias PROJECT ABSTRACT  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk that is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. To increase dissemination, this effective classroom-based training has been transformed to online internet modules that improve access for busy staff including those in rural and small NHs and increase ease of dissemination across long term care service settings. To further enhance training effects, SPEEKO for Elderspeak, an automated performance-based app that uses natural language processing has been developed to provide immediate reinforcement of training to staff at the point-of care. This study will build on app proof of concept to establish feasibility of use in the clinical setting and will test preliminary efficacy of the app for augmenting the effect of training on reducing elderspeak communication in dementia care.  This R21 will conduct a clinical trial in response to PAR-18-179; Research on Informal and Formal Caregiving for Alzheimer’s Disease by testing a technology-based, natural language processing app to support caregivers in addressing unique challenges of providing advanced dementia care. We will demonstrate feasibility of use at the point-of-care with five certified nursing assistants, and further validate the app’s accuracy by comparing app outputs reporting diminutive use to results from transcription and psycholinguistic coding. Hypothesized app effects on augmenting reductions in staff elderspeak diminutive use after training will be tested in a cluster randomized trial comparing immediate and delayed feedback with 60 CNAs in 6 nursing homes. If effective in boosting training effects, this readily scalable app can be disseminated across long term care service and support settings to increase communication training effects that will reduce resident BPSD and psychotropic medication use and provide periodic reinforcement for communication training.  The goal is to further improve and sustain effects of communication training in nursing staff that will reduce BPSD and inappropriate use of psychoactive medications. This nonpharmacological approach uses available technology to improve dementia care and aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. PROJECT NARRATIVE This R21 will test an automated natural language processing feedback app that has the potential to improve and sustain effects of communication training for nursing home staff and subsequently to reduce Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia and resulting inappropriate use of psychoactive medications in nursing home residents with dementia.

"Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data PROJECT SUMMARY Large electronic health record research (EHR) data integrated with -omics data from linked biorepositories have expanded opportunities for precision medicine research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based personalized cancer risk and progression prediction models, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice and ultimately realize the promise of precision oncology. However, efficiently and effectively using EHR for cancer research remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, obtaining precise event time information such as time of cancer recurrence is a major bottleneck in using EHR for precision medicine research due to the requirement of laborious medical record review and the lack of documentation. Simple estimates of the event time based on billing or procedure codes may poorly approximate the true event time. Naive use of such estimated event times can lead to highly biased estimates due to the approximation error. Such biases impose challenges to performing pragmatic trials when the study endpoint is time to events and captured using EHR. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill these methodological gaps in risk assessment for cancer research using EHR data, which will advance our ability to achieve the promise of precision oncology. Statistical algorithms and software will be developed to (i) automatically assign event time information using longitudinally recorded EHR information; and (ii) to perform accurate risk assessment using noisy proxies of event times. The proposed tools for risk assessment using imperfect EHR data without requiring extensive manual chart review could greatly improve the utility of EHR for oncology research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal addresses major methodological gaps in effectively utilizing EHR data for risk assessment due to the noisy nature of EHR data. We propose novel statistical algorithms and software to (i) efficiently annotate event time by combining multiple longitudinally recorded code information and (ii) to provide precise risk estimates using noisy proxies of event times. By drawing upon the rich albeit imperfect data from bio-repository linked EHR, our algorithms will advance our ability to use EHR data for precision oncology research.",Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data,9827744,R21CA242940,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Boston', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Proxy', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'adjudicate', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2019,192385,-0.02045202327318111
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,9785527,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2019,192917,-0.012492691822501071
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this ﬁeld typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind admis- sion risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modiﬁable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital ad- missions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classiﬁcation models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to signiﬁcantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close men- toring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a support- ive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identiﬁcation and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,9681485,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'social', 'supportive environment', 'trend', 'trial design']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2019,195076,-0.015496547354744301
"The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms Project Summary Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, an important developmental period during which higher education, first jobs, and relationships are pursued. Recurrent mood episodes during this period can have a devastating impact on a young person's ability to achieve a high quality of life as an adult. A method by which to predict the onset of mood symptoms in adolescence would create an opportunity to intervene and reduce exposure to the harmful effects of recurrent episodes. A new approach – digital phenotyping – may make this possible. Digital phenotyping is defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors (accelerometer, texts, calls, GPS). Digital phenotyping has been used to identify mood changes and potential signs of relapse in adults with BD, but has not yet been applied to adolescents. We will use Beiwe, a digital phenotyping application for iOS and Android phones, to collect digital phenotypes from participants (aged 14-19) over 18-months (N=120; n=70 with BD [I, II, Other Specified], n=50 typically-developing). Over the follow-up period, participants will complete biweekly mood assessments, and both participants and caregivers will be interviewed monthly to track changes in mood/behavior. This will allow the phone sensor data collected with Beiwe to be closely linked to symptom changes. The specific aims of this project are (1) to characterize the digital phenotype of BD symptoms in adolescents, (2) to describe differences in the digital phenotypes of the BD and typically developing groups, and (3) to develop a model for predicting mood symptoms prospectively. The proposed study is consistent with all four NIMH strategic objectives for the future of mental health research. This K23 Award will provide Anna Van Meter, PhD with the necessary training and mentorship to (1) gain proficiency in computational psychiatry by learning to analyze longitudinal data using statistical and machine learning techniques, (2) build expertise in patient-oriented translational research by designing and conducting a longitudinal study with youth participants; (3) learn to employ state-of-the-art mobile technology to personalize assessment and intervention using patient data. To accomplish these training goals, Dr. Van Meter has organized an outstanding mentorship team (Anil Malhotra, MD, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, DSc, John Kane, MD, Christoph Correll, MD, and Deborah Estrin, PhD), with expertise in patient-oriented research, technology-based mental health research, computational psychiatry, bipolar disorder in youth, and computer science. The proposed study will be the first to describe the digital phenotype of BD in adolescents, a population at great risk for the onset of BD as well as the damaging effects of repeated episodes. The completion of the proposed K23 Mentored Career Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research, and will provide Dr. Van Meter with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator pursuing novel technological solutions to improve patients' quality of life.

"Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Zafar is a neurointensivist and clinical neurophysiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, whose goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic clinical trials using neurophysiologic tools, to improve outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries and seizures. Epileptiform abnormalities (seizures and seizure-like rhythmic patterns) are seen on electroencephalography (EEG) in up to 40% of acute brain injury patients and are associated with worse outcomes. Due to lack of evidence-based guidance, patients with epileptiform abnormalities are often aggressively treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), exposing them to AED related adverse effects that may worsen outcomes. Dr. Zafar's preliminary data shows that increasing burden of epileptiform abnormalities in patients with hemorrhagic stroke is associated with worse outcomes. Up to half these patients receive AED treatment with no improvement in outcomes, and AED use itself is independently associated with worse outcomes. Dr. Zafar has built a comprehensive EEG database of 2000 patients to investigate AED effectiveness. In her career development plan, she will be using the rich neurophysiologic data in the EEG database, along with a nationwide dataset (Premier Healthcare Database) to study AED and EEG utilization patterns and AED effectiveness in a “real-clinical world” setting. Under the mentorship of Dr. M. Bradon Westover, and co-mentors (Dr. John Hsu, Dr. Elisabetta Patorno, and Dr. Hang Lee), Dr. Zafar proposes to: 1) Determine which specific epileptiform abnormalities show an acute response to AEDs by assessing neurological improvement within 24 hours of treatment (EEG database), 2) Assess the impact of AEDs on in- hospital clinical adverse outcomes and discharge functional outcomes in acute brain injury patients with epileptiform abnormalities (EEG database), 3) Investigate how AED-related adverse outcomes vary with practice patterns across hospitals with different resources and EEG utilization patterns (Premier Database). Dr. Zafar will perform a systematic exploration of the EEG database to determine EEG phenotypes associated with response to AED treatment, and determine the impact of AEDs on in-hospital adverse outcomes (e.g. mortality, hepatotoxicity, cardiac events). To account for national variation in AED prescription, hospital resources and EEG use, Dr. Zafar will examine adverse outcomes in the Premier Database. In addition to the proposed research, Dr. Zafar's career development plan includes a Masters of Science and coursework on analysis of large databases, pharmacoepidemiology and machine learning. Dr. Zafar will receive guidance from her mentors and advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow Dr. Zafar to establish a niche in using neurophysiologic data in comparative effectiveness research and launch an independent research career aimed at improving neurologic outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries. Project Narrative Although patients admitted with brain injuries such as stroke and traumatic brain injury are at high risk for developing seizures, physicians have very limited information to guide anti-epileptic drug management in such patients. This results in frequent overuse of anti-epileptic mediations that are also known to have harmful side effects. Dr. Zafar's proposed project will significantly advance our knowledge on which patients benefit the most from treatment and which patients are at highest risk for harmful side effects, providing guidance for physicians in making treatment decisions that will improve outcomes in the thousands of brain injury patients admitted to US hospitals each year.",Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury,9871037,K23NS114201,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'General Hospitals', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master of Science', 'Mediation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological Models', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Variant', 'active comparator', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative effectiveness', 'disorder subtype', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'neurophysiology', 'patient subsets', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'side effect', 'skills', 'stroke patient', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2019,200880,-0.021685661031617114
"Mitigating High Grade Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia through Pretreatment Autologous Lymphocyte Infusion PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation induced lymphopenia (RIL) is a common radiation-related toxicity that has been recognized for over a century but often ignored as clinically inconsequential. However, accumulating evidence has demonstrated strong association of high grade RIL (seen in 30-50% of patients) with poor prognosis. The pervasive role of radiotherapy in the curative management of solid tumors supports the need to develop mitigating strategies, particularly for patients with a high risk of developing grade 4 (G4) RIL. We have compelling evidence from both clinical and preclinical work that severe RIL impacts cancer control and therapy effectiveness, and methods to reduce RIL may improve treatment outcomes. To further develop these approaches for clinical translation, we have proposed 2 specific aims. In aim 1, we will build on our initial prediction model for G4 RIL and leverage our large database of esophageal cancer patients who have completed chemoradiation (CRT) to develop a better predictive model for G4 RIL so that we can rapidly and efficiently identify the highest risk patients for mitigating strategies. In aim 2, we will determine the feasibility and safety of raising the baseline lymphocyte levels by autologous lymphocyte infusion (ALI) prior to initiating CRT. Fundamentally, this research will allow us to develop the necessary computational tool capable of properly identifying patients at risk for developing severe RIL, and complete a small feasibility and safety study of using ALI as a way to raise the baseline pre-treatment lymphocyte levels so that the probability of developing G4 RIL could be possibly curtailed. By targeting the at-risk patients to receive RIL mitigating strategies, we will hopefully be able to improve the cancer outcomes of standard cancer therapies, and build on current innovative strategies of immunotherapy and radiation combinations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Radiation therapy, a key pillar in the management of cancers, causes a common yet ignored side effect of radiation induced lymphopenia (RIL). Severe RIL has been linked to poor outcomes of patients, presumably due to reduced immune surveillance thereby increasing disease recurrence after radiation therapy. We propose developing a prediction model to help identify who are most at risk for developing severe RIL, and conduct a pilot study to help reduce the impact of RIL so that clinical outcomes for these at-risk patients will improve in the future.",Mitigating High Grade Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia through Pretreatment Autologous Lymphocyte Infusion,9807793,R21CA240881,"['Applications Grants', 'Bayesian Prediction', 'Blood Component Removal', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Combination immunotherapy', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Inferior', 'Infusion procedures', 'Link', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Lymphocyte', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphopenia', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nomograms', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Proliferating', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Validation', 'Work', 'autologous lymphocytes', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'disorder control', 'fundamental research', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized approach', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'radiation effect', 'response', 'safety and feasibility', 'safety study', 'side effect', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R21,2019,211410,-0.017474661200407124
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Analytics-Based Platform for Diabetic Retinopathy Care Management ABSTRACT Despite the over 90% efficacy of diabetic retinopathy (DR) treatment, it continues to be the leading cause of blindness in working age Americans. Over 30 million adults in the US have diabetes. Of these, 28% will develop DR and 4.4% will develop vision-threatening DR (VTDR). Currently, less than half of all patients with diabetes receive the recommended annual dilated eye exam and, of those diagnosed with VTDR, only 30% undergo timely treatment. New screening protocols are increasing screening effectiveness, however, even if every patient is screened, the majority of those at increased risk do not receive evidence-based follow-up care; a classic public health failure common to population-based screening. With expertise in health systems engineering and ophthalmology, the research team is uniquely suited to eliminate the root causes of this failure; resulting in a new, comprehensive care model designed to prevent blindness for the 8.9 million Americans with DR. Retinal Care Inc. (RCI)’s focus is on eliminating blindness by applying targeted care coordination for patients at increased risk for VTDR; ensuring they progress through the care path to treatment. However, two significant deficiencies weaken RCI’s ability to deliver effective care coordination. The first is insufficient capacity due to coordinating care for 35% of all patients, though less than 5% actually have VTDR. This derives from the low positive predictive value of the current system, based on a handheld electroretinography and pupillography device deployed in a primary care setting. The first aim is to improve the ability to classify a patient as low- risk for VTDR, thereby reducing the care coordination burden and improving quality and effectiveness. Aim 1: Improve the ability to accurately identify patients at increased risk for VTDR by including patient  health and demographic attributes in a machine learning based predictive algorithm for VTDR diagnosis.  Patient clusters will be identified (a) and used to create sub-population specific risk models (b). The second deficiency is the lack of adherence to follow-up and treatment after identification as increased risk for VTDR. Once a patient is identified as increased risk, the care coordination of the RCI DR program has averaged over five phone calls per patient to achieve follow-up with an eye care provider. The second aim is to identify and eliminate these barriers to coordinated care between patient and provider. Aim 2 Apply text analytics and simulation to improve access, compliance, cost, and equity by enhancing care coordination, from diagnosis to treatment, for patients at increased risk for VTDR. The application of data analytics and systems engineering methods to integrate and improve each critical component of the care path, access to care, accuracy of diagnosis, and adherence to follow-up and treatment, will enable a paradigm shift in DR treatment. RCI’s platform is designed to eliminate deficiencies of the current care delivery model by delivering a first-of-its-kind, end-to-end solution for diabetic retinopathy care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic retinopathy (DR), affecting 8.9 million Americans, is the leading cause of blindness in working age Americans, yet, blindness is preventable in 90% of the cases with timely detection and treatment. To reach the 30 million adults living with diabetes in the US, the Retinal Care DR platform is designed to eliminate deficiencies of the current care delivery model via a first-of- its-kind end-to-end solution for DR care implementable in any care setting. This will be accomplished via the application of data analytics (machine learning and statistical analysis) and systems engineering (sentiment analysis and simulation) methods to integrate and improve each of the three critical components of the care path: access to care, accuracy of diagnosis, and adherence to follow-up and treatment.",Analytics-Based Platform for Diabetic Retinopathy Care Management,9679729,R41EY029917,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroretinography', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Improve Access', 'Information Systems', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Rights', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Service delivery model', 'Severities', 'Social Workers', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical method', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care costs', 'care providers', 'classification trees', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'model design', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'pupillography', 'response', 'screening', 'simulation', 'sociodemographics']",NEI,"RETINAL CARE, INC.",R41,2019,219356,-0.08517869778821095
"MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing. ABSTRACT As rates of adolescent depression and suicidality continue to trend upwards, the healthcare system struggles to address the need for and lack of mental health service use. The pediatric patient-centered medical home model may improve adolescent depression outcomes by enhancing access to and coordinating care, as well as providing ongoing monitoring. Unfortunately, despite guideline recommendations, over 2/3 of adolescents identified with depression symptoms in primary care do not receive symptom monitoring and 19% do not re- ceive symptom reassessment. This lack of symptom monitoring and reassessment can result in untoward health outcomes including a decrease in functioning, increased use of acute and crisis services, and hospitali- zations due to suicidality. Current technologies which incorporate data passively collected from smartphones offer an opportunity for intercurrent monitoring between patient visits which limits burden on the patient to self- report and limits burden on the healthcare system, allowing primary care teams to triage contacting and as- sessing patients a system identifies with an increase in disease severity. This formative study will demonstrate the usability and potential clinical utility of MoodRing, a technology intervention which will collect passive mo- bile phone sensor data on aspects of adolescent phone use related to depressive symptom severity (e.g. com- munication patterns, social media use, travel) and integrate this data into a multi-user (adolescent, parent, pri- mary care provider/care manager) platform from which symptoms can be viewed and secure communication can occur. MoodRing, as supported by Health Belief Model, may lead to improved quality of depression man- agement (increased symptom reassessment, therapy/medication adherence) through increasing self-efficacy, social support from parent and care team, as well as encouraging application of self-management skills through increased self-management knowledge, skills, and symptom feedback. MoodRing builds on a solid foundation of investigators experienced in design of technology interventions to increase adolescent initiation of depression treatment, who have already developed machine algorithms for passive sensing and a small business partner with vast experience in working with health researchers to develop multi-user web/mobile platforms. This STTR Phase I study seeks to accomplish two aims. The first is to apply a machine learning pipeline developed for college-aged youth to adolescents with depression and determine whether self-reported depressive symptoms can be reliably predicted from passive data with at least 85% accuracy. The second is the user design and system architecture of MoodRing. If milestones are achieved that models are successful at predicting depressive symptoms and the proposed MoodRing intervention is acceptable to adolescents, par- ents, and primary care providers/care managers, then we will pursue the STTR Phase II study. The aims of Phase II include the development and subsequent efficacy trial of MoodRing. Specifically, we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting of MoodRing as compared to usual care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression affects up to a fifth of adolescents but less than half get treatment. This project aims to develop and design MoodRing, a technology platform, which will gather information about how an adolescent uses their mobile phone and translate that into what it means about symptoms of depression they are experiencing. This platform will provide symptom feedback to the adolescent themselves, their parent, and their healthcare pro- vider, with the goal that having awareness of symptoms and a safe place to communicate with parents and healthcare providers will allow for more adolescents to better self-manage their mood and get better quality treatment for depression.",MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing.,9908603,R44MH122067,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bile fluid', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Businesses', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Information Resources Management', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Medical center', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social support', 'Solid', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'aged', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'child depression', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'computer science', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'health belief', 'health care service utilization', 'health service use', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'pediatric patients', 'persistent symptom', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'primary care setting', 'routine screening', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sensor', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'social media', 'suicide rate', 'system architecture', 'therapy adherence', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment response', 'trend', 'university student', 'usability']",NIMH,NURELM E-BUSINESS SOFTWARE,R44,2019,223419,0.014897248152411086

Approximately 40% of these are misdiagnosed infections in healthy ears, leading to 6-9 million unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions annually. In fact, ear infection is the leading cause of unnecessary antibiotic use in children, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars wasted and millions of children placed at undue risk for adverse side effects. On a societal level, unnecessary antibiotic use and resultant resistant microorganisms adds $20B in excess healthcare costs annually. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American Academy of Family Physicians have identified improved ear infection diagnostics as necessary to slow the spread of resistant microorganisms. Unfortunately, despite updated clinical guidelines dating back to 1994, no significant reduction in unnecessary prescription rates has been achieved.  Even a modest improvement in ear infection diagnosis has the potential to positively affect millions of children, save hundreds of millions in direct costs, and slow the evolution of resistant bacteria. Cactus invented Optical Tympanometry (OT) technology to improve ear infection diagnosis in primary care, where most cases are seen. Cactus technology is 98% accurate in a clinical study of 30 pediatric participants, and works in clean and waxy ears. Intellectual Merit  Children affected with ear infection are most often too young to adequately describe their symptoms. Signs of ear infections are numerous, but they are also very non-specific. Clinical diagnosis is most commonly done by assessing a set of qualitative factors using an otoscope to provide a magnified view of the ear drum. Most clinicians look for middle ear redness. However, redness alone is less than 65% accurate, matching accuracy statistics observed in primary care. The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians recommend an objective quantitative assessment of the presence or absence of middle ear effusion (MEE). In fact, Key Action Statement 1C in the AAP’s most recent Acute Otitis Media (active ear infection requiring antibiotic treatment, AOM) guideline states:  Clinicians should not diagnose AOM in children who do not have middle ear effusion (MEE)  Currently, MEE is often unassessed due to technology limitations. Existing acoustic and pneumatic devices are slow, subjective and can be painful to children. As a result, clinicians commonly prescribe a course of antibiotics out of a preponderance of caution, or to placate parents. Cactus invented OT as a rapid, seamless means of assessing MEE during otoscopy. This SBIR Phase I proposal validates a miniaturized embodiment of OT (LED-OT) built into the familiar otoscope. Specific Aims Aim 1 (Month 0-2): Assembly and Repeatability & Reproducibility Study of LED-OT Otoscopes. Cactus has developed a patent pending (US62/675,056 & US161040195) LED-OT otoscope based on its innovative multiLED microchip, which houses all 13 wavelengths required for OT in a 6x6mm form factor. Cactus will assemble 6 LED-OT otoscope units for rigorous measurement repeatability and reproducibility assessment followed by clinical validation in Aims 2-3. Aim 2 (Month 2-12): Clinical Data Collection IRB approved (UCI HS#2016-3039) data collection will take place under the supervision of UC Irvine Professor Elliot Botvinick via a sub-award. Clinical data collection mirrors that used in 510(k) applications for previously cleared acoustic devices and enables receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of LED-OT otoscopy. Aim 3 (Month 2-12): Clinical Data Analysis Clinical data analysis will be concurrent with data collection, with two specific goals. First, train OT’s statistical component. Second, validate performance of LED-OT in pediatric participants using ROC analysis. A successful outcome of this proposal will be validated LED-OT technology and 6 otoscopes prepared for a pivotal study in Phase II to compare LED-OT and acoustic methods in an office setting. Together, Phase I and II will prepare LED-OT for analytical and clinical trials necessary for a 510(k) application, encourage adoption of our revolutionary technology, and facilitate private investment and relationships with strategic partners. Project Narrative  Cactus Medical, LLC is developing a rapid, low-cost, non-invasive ear infection indicator to improve ear infection diagnosis in pediatric care settings. Cactus’ SmartScope will provide physicians with an accurate indication of ear infection at the press of a button while they are performing their normal inspection of the ear drum through an otoscope. SmartScope technology has shown 98% accuracy in a pediatric clinical study. This device has the potential to save $1.5 billion annually and reduce the rate at which anti-bacterial resistance evolves by limiting unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions and protect millions of children from unnecessary antibiotic treatment.",Clinical validation of a novel handheld optical measurement system to enable 1-touch assessment of middle ear effusion in standard otoscopy,9844869,R43DC018248,"['Academy', 'Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Cactaceae', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collection', 'Confidence Intervals', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Ear', 'Evolution', 'Family Physicians', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Health Care Costs', 'Infection', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Oranges', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otoscopes', 'Otoscopy', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Readiness', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Tympanic membrane', 'Tympanometry', 'Tympanostomy', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'design', 'ear infection', 'experience', 'flexible electronics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microchip', 'microorganism', 'middle ear', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'pediatrician', 'professor', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'validation studies']",NIDCD,"CACTUS MEDICAL,LLC",R43,2019,224808,-0.01888117302449544
"Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome is a disabling condition for 2.5 million Americans associated with  prolonged fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and sleep disturbances. The cause of CFS remains  unknown, and there are currently no available diagnostic tests to confirm disease. However, a  substantial number of immune features have been measured in CFS. Given this problem, the objective  of this project is to identify a panel of distinct antibody epitopes that can be used to identify  cases of CFS using a blood test. In Aim 1, we will apply serum epitope repertoire analysis to  determine the antibody epitope repertoires within a cohort of 200 CFS patients and 175  controls. Antibody epitopes occurring in CFS sera, and not controls will be identified   using bioinformatics methods. A panel of motifs will be downselected using machine  learning to optimize sensitivity and specificity within the discovery set. The performance of  the panel will be measured in an independent set of specimens to determine sensitivity and  specificity, and identify potential CFS subgroups. We will determine whether individual  markers, or sets of markers, correlate with various clinical features of CFS. Infections with a variety of pathogens have been associated with the development of fatigue lasting  one year or longer, and post-infection fatigue patients typically meet clinical criteria for CFS.  Given the potential for heterogeneous infectious etiology, we hypothesize that CFS patients may  exhibit increased rates of seropositivity for a broad set of infectious agents associated with  fatigue. Using serum epitope repertoire analysis, we will determine whether IgG seropositivity for  20 infections (as a group) differs between CFS patients and controls. The proposed project may  identify antibody biomarkers suitable for development of diagnostic immunoassay for CFS, and may  elucidate whether prior or ongoing infections are associated with CFS. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalitis (ME), is a disabling condition  affecting an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States. The cause of CFS  remains unknown, and there are no objective laboratory diagnostic tests to  confirm disease. Consequently, diagnosis of CFS remains exceptionally difficult, requiring the  exclusion of a wide variety fatiguing illnesses. This project aims to apply advanced molecular  discovery tools and computation to identify patterns of circulating antibodies that can be   used to diagnose and monitor CFS patients using a blood test. This project also holds the  potential to associate prior infections with the development of CFS.",Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome,9778480,R43AI145696,"['Academy', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Arthralgia', 'Autoantibodies', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Caregivers', 'Cell physiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cholinergic Receptors', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cost of Illness', 'Coxiella', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Exertion', 'Exhibits', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Fever Chills', 'Gene Expression', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Mononucleosis', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Muscarinics', 'Myalgia', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nuclear Antigens', 'Organism', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Seroprevalences', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Sore Throat', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'United States', 'acute infection', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'flu', 'immune activation', 'interest', 'lymph nodes', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'seropositive', 'sleep abnormalities', 'tool', 'trend']",NIAID,"SERIMMUNE, INC.",R43,2019,224975,-0.02236730350676217
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9769734,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2019,228000,-0.01771814872902465
"Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants PROJECT SUMMARY Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening, gastrointestinal (GI) emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. ""Leaky gut"", or intestinal barrier immaturity with elevated intestinal permeability (IP), is the proximate cause of susceptibility to NEC in preterm neonates. Early detection of leaky gut is essential to identify infants at risk for NEC to prevent and reduce disease severity. No clinical factor, routine laboratory test or biomarker alone or in combination have been described that identify preterm neonates with impaired intestinal barrier function who at increased risk for NEC. The goal of this study is to develop a rapid, non-invasive screening tool to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. We recently revealed rapid maturation of the intestinal barrier is strongly associated with clinical factors such as early breastmilk feeding, less antibiotic exposure and later post-menstrual age, and significantly higher abundance and metabolic activities of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Although the butyrate producing Clostridiales have been implicated in strengthening the intestinal epithelial barrier and reducing intestinal inflammation, it is unknown whether butyrate and potentially other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with neonatal intestinal barrier maturation. Our preliminary data revealed butyrate production pathways, in particular Pyruvate/Acetyl-CoA pathway are significantly more abundant in low IP subjects. In this study, we propose to validate a substantiated measure of fecal microbial and/or metabolic biomarkers combined with associated neonatal factors for a rapid, non-invasive screening test. We postulate that the level(s) of metabolic activities, particularly butyrate production and potentially other SCFAs via increased colonization of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium, are associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates. To address our hypothesis, we will leverage existed stool samples collected from a cohort of ~200 preterms (<33 weeks), for whom both microbiota (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and IP (urine non-metabolized sugar probes lactulose and rhamnose) are available, and propose 2 aims: 1) to determine fecal metabolic activities associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates <33 weeks gestation; and 2) to identify and characterize butyrate-producing bacteria associated with intestinal permeability in preterm neonates during the first 7-10 days of life. At the completion of the study, we will determine the biomarkers associated with healthy intestinal barrier functions and the discriminatory scheme for accurate classification of high or low IP group. Our long-term goal is to conduct a randomize clinical trial of rationally designed intervention for NEC early prevention. Refinement of the screening tool will identify infants with aberrant leaky gut, an essential prerequisite for subsequent rational design of novel strategies such as clinical trials of probiotics to promote healthy intestinal barrier functions to reduce NEC incidence. PROJECT NARRATIVE ""Leaky gut"", is the proximate cause of susceptibility to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening, gastrointestinal emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. This proposal will develop and validate a rapid, non-invasive screening test incorporating microbiome-based markers and associated neonatal factors, to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. The results of this study will support clinical trials aimed to optimize intestinal maturation and to reduce the burden of NEC complications. This study will address major knowledge gaps of the intestinal microenvironment in preterm infants, and ultimately lead to improved strategies to manage neonatal gastrointestinal health, improve children’s health and quality of life, all which are within the mission of NIDDK.",Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants,9872417,R21DK123674,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anabolism', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Butyrates', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epithelial', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Milk', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lactulose', 'Lead', 'Leaky Gut', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Necrosis', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Pyruvate', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Urine', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'early screening', 'feeding', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mucosal microbiota', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sex', 'stool sample', 'sugar', 'supervised learning', 'therapy design']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2019,231750,-0.009030841220703184
"Development of a tracheal sound sensor for early detection of hypoventilation due to opioid overdose. Abstract More than 64,000 Americans died from drug overdose in 2016 and drug overdose is now the most common cause of death for people under 50 years old in the United States. Furthermore, the number of overdose deaths is increasing with the rise of abuse of powerful synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl. In May of 2017 National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) directors Drs. Collins and Volkow outlined how research may help reduce the death toll associated with the current opioid epidemic; one of the current critical needs is the development of new overdose-reversal interventions, including wearable technologies that can detect an (impending) overdose from physiological signals to signal for help, or trigger a coupled automated injection of naloxone. Automated detection of overdose is essential because most opioid overdoses occur when individuals are alone and unobserved by family members or first responders. Opioids cause respiration to slow and become irregular due to mu-opioid receptor mediated suppression of respiratory related regions of the brainstem and spinal cord. Importantly, there are characteristic early changes in breathing pattern that indicate a progression towards significant hypoventilation, but there is currently no easy-to –use method or device to measure these patterns non-invasively. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in respiratory monitoring using tracheal sounds. Tracheal sounds originate from the vibrations of the tracheal wall and surrounding soft tissues caused by gas pressure fluctuations in the trachea. These sounds can be collected from a microphone placed over the trachea and analyzed to determine the real-time respiratory rate and an estimate of respiratory flow and tidal volume. We hypothesize that individual trends in tracheal sounds detected by a machine- learning algorithm will provide an early warning sign of the onset of hypoventilation as a result of opioid overdose in humans. The aims of this proposal are to develop a machine learning algorithm that detects impending hypoventilation due to an opioid overdose and to develop an initial design for a miniature wireless tracheal sound sensor. Project Narrative RTM Vital Signs, LLC is developing a non-invasive Tracheal Sound Sensor for early detection of impending hypoventilation due to an opioid overdose. The sensor will continuously monitor an individual’s respiratory pattern to detect a significant change from baseline, in which case it will contact a caregiver and/or emergency personnel detailing the location and status of the person experiencing an opioid overdose or initiate a coupled naloxone injection. This technology has the potential to prevent a significant number of deaths as a result of opioid overdose by allowing for the timely detection of hypoventilation and administration of naloxone.",Development of a tracheal sound sensor for early detection of hypoventilation due to opioid overdose.,9680488,R41DA047779,"['Abdomen', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Body Patterning', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emergency Medical Technicians', 'Engineering', 'Environmental air flow', 'Family member', 'Fentanyl', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Hypercapnic respiratory failure', 'Hypoxemia', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Naloxone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Noise', 'Opioid', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Sedation procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Snoring', 'Sorbus', 'Spinal Cord', 'Study Subject', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Thick', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Trachea', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'alertness', 'base', 'body position', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'engineering design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microphone', 'mu opioid receptors', 'notch protein', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'phase 2 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smartphone Application', 'soft tissue', 'sound', 'synthetic opioid', 'time use', 'trend', 'vibration', 'volunteer', 'wearable technology']",NIDA,"RTM VITAL SIGNS, LLC",R41,2019,236381,-0.018159695966231435
"SCH: Leveraging Clinical Time Series to Learn Optimal Treatment of Acute Dyspnea  The ability to rapidly match the right patients to the right treatments at the right time is critical to ensuring patients  receive high quality care. The vast majority of machine learning applications in healthcare focus on diagnosing or  stratifying patients for a particular outcome. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn how clinical states  (i.e., sets of signs, symptoms, and test results) respond to specific sequences of treatments, with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes. RL does not aim to diagnose, but infers diagnosis based on a patient's response to  specific treatments--in many ways mimicking how clinicians operate in practice. This proposal will develop a novel  clinician-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) framework that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) clinical time-series data to support physician decision making, iteratively providing physicians the estimated outcome of  potential treatment strategies. Our topic of focus for this work is the evaluation and treatment of patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) and signs of impending respiratory failure. Acute dyspnea is an ideal condition for an RL approach, since it can be due to three overlapping conditions: congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Determining optimal treatment for these patients is clinically difficult, as a patient's presentation is frequently ambiguous, rapidly changing, and often due to multiple causes.  Inappropriate treatment may occur in up to a third of patients leading to increased mortality. While developing this  RL framework, we will also develop methods to learn more useful representations of high-dimensional clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training. In addition, given the challenges of working with observational health data, we will develop new methods for evaluation of learned policies and develop new theory to better understand the limitations of RL using observational data. The project has four aims: 1) create a shareable, de-identified EHR time-series dataset of 35,000 patients with acute dyspnea, 2) develop techniques for exploiting invariances In tasks involving clinical time-series data to improve the efficiency of RL model training, 3) develop and evaluate an RL-based framework for learning optimal treatment policies for acute dyspnea, and 4) prospectively validate the learned treatment model. This research will result in new techniques for learning representations from time-series data and will study both the theoretical and practical limitations of RL using observational clinical data, leading to key advancements in ML and RL for clinical care. The tools developed for clinical decision support in this proposal have the potential for high impact because of their ability to generalize beyond the problem studied here to other conditions, laying the groundwork for clinical systems that directly impact society by aiding in the timely and appropriate treatment of patients. Hospitalization for sudden and severe shortness of breath (acute dyspnea) affects almost 2 million patients in the US each  year. Such patients can be difficult to treat, as their presentation may ambiguous, due to multiple causes that change over  time and require different types of therapies/treatments. In this proposal, we will develop novel reinforcement-learning  based approaches to quickly match patients to the best treatment based on his/her symptoms over time.

"Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care This proposal presents innovations to addressing teen depression during routine check-up visits through further development of an online clinical process support system called CHADIS. The primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for other teen challenges might also be promising. Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the past year 30. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive necessary care.3 This proposal addresses the significant public health problem of teen depression through use of a comprehensive, process-driven intervention targeting time points before, during, and after routine visits with primary care providers (PCPs) through a new module to an online clinical process support system called CHADIS.",Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care,9778280,R44MH116751,"['17 year old', 'Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Moods', 'Office Visits', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Qualitative Research', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Specialist', 'Specialty Boards', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'chatbot', 'checkup examination', 'child depression', 'control trial', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'programs', 'recruit', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'shared decision making', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'skills', 'success', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2019,242854,0.009768351329787069
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018,9769695,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antioxidants', 'Apical', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Budesonide', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Chinese People', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'Taiwan', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vitamin E', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'bile salts', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'hepatotoxin', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outreach', 'pediatric patients', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'transcriptomics', 'transport inhibitor', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,256000,0.0017978829290519328
"Fast and Easy Assessment of Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this study is to develop an objective tool for the fast and easy assessment of stroke, by developing a novel analytics platform that quickly identifies potential stroke from movement signatures captured with wearable sensors. The tool uses unobtrusive wearable sensors and does not require medical training to operate, and thus will be valuable for families and caregivers of older Americans with high stroke risk who are either living at home or in an assisted living facility. Ischemic stroke affects nearly 700,000 Americans each year, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been an FDA approved therapy for ischemic stroke since 1995, yet only 5-10% of eligible patients receive this therapy. Arrival time in the emergency room (ER) after initial stroke symptoms is directly associated with better outcomes after tPA and endovascular therapy, specifically 4.5 hours and up to 24 hours in select patients, respectively. It is well established that treatment with tPA decreases the lifetime cost of stroke to third party payers by $25,000 per patient. As a result, health plans will be the ultimate economic buyer for this new technology. Here, we are not developing a new therapy for stroke, where so many others have failed. We seek, rather, to fill a well-accepted and clear gap for stroke patients: the early recognition of stroke symptoms that prevents them from accessing PROVEN but time dependent treatments in stroke, whose impact on outcomes is well established. Early identification of symptoms and timely treatment is the single most important determinant of outcomes in ischemic stroke. However, despite massive public health campaigns, most people do not identify stroke symptoms, resulting in costly delays in calling 9-1-1 and patients arriving in the hospital too late to benefit from ischemic stroke treatments. This is a growing problem, given the aging US population of which a significant portion lives at home alone, the staffing crisis at assisted living and nursing facilities, and the prevalence of stroke which is expected to increase by 20% by 2030. Given these trends, administrators and aging experts are increasingly recognizing the value of remote monitoring and aging in place initiatives. Thus, there a clear and urgent, unmet need for a method to assist untrained stroke victims, their families and caregivers in the early recognition of stroke. Bridging this gap with a fast, easy and objective solution would have significant public health impact, because millions of patients could access therapies in a window that is already known to improve outcomes for brain injury. To address this problem, we have leveraged our team’s unique expertise in stroke neurology and developed a set of activation tasks coupled with a wearable solution to assess and quantify ischemic stroke. Once deployed, our solution will improve stroke emergency response and increase the number of patients receiving IV tPA and other reperfusion therapies in the acute setting. NARRATIVE Ischemic stroke affects nearly 700,000 Americans, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. Though treatment for stroke has been available for over 20 years, only a very small number of eligible patients receive it because individuals who have suffered a stroke do not reach the emergency room in time. We have developed a method for quick, easy, real-time assessment for stroke, which will dramatically improve the number of patients receiving timely therapy after stroke and improve the outcome for stroke.",Fast and Easy Assessment of Stroke,9847511,R43NS110338,"['Accelerometer', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alteplase', 'American', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency response', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Innovation Corps', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Limb structure', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurologist', 'Nurses', 'Oranges', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physician Executives', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Third-Party Payer', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aging in place', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disability', 'health plan', 'healthy volunteer', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'life time cost', 'motor impairment', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phase 1 study', 'post stroke', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'sex', 'societal costs', 'standard of care', 'stroke neurology', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke symptom', 'stroke therapy', 'stroke victims', 'tool', 'trend', 'volunteer', 'wearable device']",NINDS,"ALVA HEALTH, INC.",R43,2019,256988,0.025462666274537908
"Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT [ Pediatric specialists are often required to identify infants who are likely to suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcome, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is the most common developmental disability among children in the United States and results from several factors, including low weight for gestational age, premature birth, and stroke. Although MRI and cranial ultrasound (cUS) provide valuable structural information in the preterm period, they have moderate sensitivity to CP and require transportation of the infant. Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have validated the clinical potential of General Movement Assessment (GMA) for CP risk identification. During the early period, (23 weeks to 36 weeks gestational age), the presence of Cramped Synchronized General Movements (CSGMs), has demonstrated very high sensitivity and specificity for CP, conjointly ranging from 80%-98%. CSGMs are assessed while preterm infants are still in an acute care facility (NICU) and can inform the clinician independently, and in combination with cUS and MRI. Despite its potential, GMA is available in only a few clinical centers, as adoption and routine application depend on lengthy, cost-intensive observation and availability of specially trained raters. A Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) is proposed that will automate GMA for bedside evaluations in both preterm and postterm periods. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology not only for routine risk identification, but also for establishing disease trajectory and potentially differentiating CP subtypes and assessing efficacy of emerging treatments along the early developmental continuum.  Preliminary studies at UC Irvine have demonstrated that GMA analysis for CSGMs can be automated by quantifying infant limb movement using highly miniaturized, 3-axis wireless accelerometers and classifying CSGMs using a patented Markov-type approach that merges an application-specific Erlang-Cox state transition model with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (“EC-DBN”), treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling CSGM (and non-CSGM) duration and interval. In Phase I, this approach will be utilized in a comparative evaluation of two movement measurement modalities to determine which has the best overall performance and clinical utility at three leading NICU centers. Infant movement data will be concurrently acquired using an advanced, second generation prototype wireless accelerometer system (CPRIS-A) and a high definition 3D (infrared) optical camera (CPRIS-O). The optical modality offers significant potential advantages as it requires no infant contact and can monitor unattended, intermittently, over weeks or months. However, its potential for GMA automation must be systematically evaluated. Classifier results from both modalities will be compared to expert rater consensus in 80 preterm infants. The primary outcome will be CSGM identification accuracy, as determined by ROC-AUC analyses, with a threshold for success of 0.85. Additional comparative performance measures include reliability and practicability in the NICU environment. An Advisory Committee of experts in the fields of neonatology, pediatrics and cerebral palsy will evaluate project results and advise on the clinical potential of each modality. ] PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood, with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per 1000 in high-income countries. The overall project goal is to develop a computerized hardware-software system capable of identifying preterm infants at high risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP), based on the systematic identification of specific patterns of movement-derived features. The Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) will enable clinical staff with only minimal training to cost effectively implement General Movement Assessment (GMA) for Cramped Synchronous General Movements (CSGMs), with interpretive reporting performed automatically.

"Identifying Protective and Risk Factors for Non-infectious Uveitis Project Summary/Abstract Background Information and Relevance: Uveitis is an important cause of permanent vision loss that affects younger patients. Despite the human and economic impact of this disease, the risk factors for non-infectious uveitis are poorly understood. This is in part because epidemiologic studies of uveitis have been limited by insufficient numbers of participants. Newly available large health care claims databases provide an opportunity to increase the ability to detect uveitis risk factors. Hypotheses: Metformin, statin, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with a lower incidence of non-infectious uveitis, while female hormonal therapies are associated with a higher incidence of non-infectious uveitis. Specific Objectives: 1. To determine if non-infectious uveitis incidence varies in relation to putative protective medications, including metformin, statins and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. 2. To determine if non-infectious uveitis incidence varies in relation the modifiable risk factor of female hormonal therapy, including hormonal replacement therapy and hormonal contraceptive therapy. Methods: The Clinformatics™ Data Mart Database contains medical claims on over 60 million beneficiaries from a large insurer in the United States. We will define non-infectious uveitis based on validated diagnosis codes recorded by an eye care provider twice within a 120-day period and exclusion of infectious or surgical causes of uveitis with diagnosis and procedural codes. Potential confounders including demographic (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education level, financial net worth) and clinical (smoking exposure) covariate information will be extracted from the database. Medication exposure will be rigorously captured based on the filling of outpatient prescriptions or coding of clinic-administered therapies. The cohort not exposed to the medication will be matched on age (±3 years), race/ethnicity, sex and date of plan entry and exit (±3 months) to the medication-exposed cohort. Propensity scores for each medication exposure will be estimated using multivariable logistic regression and the rich information on comorbid conditions and treatments available in the database. With multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, we will calculate the hazard ratios for incident non-infectious uveitis based on exposure to each of the medications listed above. To account for the possibility of systematic differences between individuals with and without the exposures of interest, the Cox proportional hazards models will be weighted by the inverse of the predicted probability of their observed exposures using the propensity scores. We will interpret the results taking into the account the multiple comparisons being tested. Implications: The well-powered, rigorous analyses proposed here offer a unique opportunity to identify novel modifiable protective and risk factors for non-infectious uveitis, guide practice patterns for discontinuation of medications that increase uveitis risk, and inform the development of clinical trials for medications for secondary uveitis prevention. Project Narrative Uveitis is an eye disease that causes blindness disproportionately in young and working-age Americans, and we do not completely understand the risk factors for developing uveitis. Our study aims to uncover the risk factors for uveitis, including whether some medications may play a role in uveitis risk.

"Using Causal Inference and Machine Learning Methods to Predict Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Response PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many patients with anxiety and fear disorders (AFDs) report minimal benefits when treated with an evidence- based psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) or pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants; benzodiazepines). Conversely, some AFD patients are likely to benefit from virtually any treatment (e.g., supportive therapy). Using data collected in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there has been limited progress determining how to use pre-treatment characteristics to match AFD patients to the treatment that is most likely to provide benefit. As a result, NIMH has forwarded Strategic Objectives focused on identifying treatment moderators and developing tools that predict differential treatment response. The broad goal of this proposed secondary data analysis is to apply causal inference and machine learning methods to prospective observational data to predict differential treatment response among patients with AFDs. The sample (n = 1,528) is from a longstanding NIMH-funded study of AFD patients who received: (a) CBT with concurrent pharmacotherapy, (b) CBT without pharmacotherapy, or (c) treatment as usual (TAU). Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (a causal inference method) and super learning (an ensemble machine learning method) will be used to accomplish the proposed Aims. Aim 1 will estimate the (overall) average effects of the three treatment types. Aim 2 will estimate “optimal treatment rules” to determine if differential treatment response can be meaningfully predicted based on a patient's multidimensional profile of pre-treatment symptoms. Aim 3 will estimate “optimal treatment rules” to determine if differential treatment response can be meaningfully predicted using all available pre-treatment covariates. The proposed study is highly innovative and could significantly impact the growing literature focused on predicting differential treatment effects and personalizing treatment for patients with AFDs. Although treatment effects estimates obtained using observational data and causal inference methods (i.e., adjusted for nonrandom treatment selection) are similar to those estimated in RCTs, this would be the first study to apply such methods to AFD patient data. This study will also be the first to use ensemble machine learning to develop composite moderators for AFDs (i.e., optimal treatment rules). In comparison, prior attempts to develop composite moderators have relied on less flexible model-building procedures prone to overfitting and unable to capture complex predictor-outcome associations (e.g., interactions among predictors; nonlinear associations). In achieving the proposed Aims, the current study would be a catalyst for future research using causal inference and machine learning to study predictors of differential treatment response among AFD patients. Results will be used to justify future research aimed at expanding and validating the models in larger observational samples and pragmatic RCTs (e.g., optimal treatment rules for specific medications/doses; timing of pharmacotherapy relative to CBT; second-wave CBT versus acceptance-based CBT). PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with anxiety and fear disorders may benefit only from certain evidence-based treatments, while others may benefit from virtually any treatment (e.g., talk therapy). The current study will use casual inference and machine learning methods to develop predictive models that identify the treatment(s) most likely to benefit a particular patient.

"Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival  Chronic kidney disease affects about 10% of adults in the United States and 7-12% of the population worldwide. It may lead to irreversible loss of kidney function, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment compared to dialysis in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. Despite the advantages of kidney transplants, most patients with ESRD are treated with dialysis primarily because there exist an insufficient number of compatible donors for patients. The human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the organ donor and recipient are known to be a significant contributing factor to transplanted organ survival times due to immunogenicity, the immune response of the recipient to the transplanted organ. Mismatches between donor and recipient HLAs are associated with shorter survival times; however, it is extremely rare to identify donors that have a perfect match with recipients, so most transplants involve mismatched HLAs. Our main objective is to accurately predict survival times for kidney transplants by incorporating both data- driven models of HLA compatibility based on outcomes of past transplants and biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve patient transplant outcomes by enabling more efficient allocation of donors and recipients, particularly by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a poorly matched donor. We propose to estimate HLA compatibilities using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to outcomes of past transplants and through a novel donor-recipient latent space model for the HLA compatibility network. We then propose to incorporate these predicted compatibilities along with biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity using amino acid sequences and epitopes into a multi-task classification-based survival prediction algorithm. Our proposed approach for learning integrated data- and biologically-driven models of transplant survival generalizes broadly to organ transplantation (liver, heart, pancreas, lungs) and possibly to bone marrow transplantation. Finding better methods for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient may redefine and improve clinical outcomes for organ and tissue transplants. In fact, new approach may revolutionize the selection of donors with recipients, thereby producing significantly improved long-term organ and tissue transplant survivals.",Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival ,9916110,R01LM013311,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens', 'Anus', 'Biological', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Donor Selection', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epitopes', 'HLA Antigens', 'Heart', 'Immune response', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Survival', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Science', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Transplanted tissue', 'United States', 'base', 'cost', 'discrete time', 'graft failure', 'hazard', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'learning network', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'survival prediction', 'transplant model']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO,R01,2019,274577,-0.008455208283077735

"Real-Time Virtual Assessment of MitraClip Placement ABSTRACT Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common type of valvular heart disease in patients over the age of 75 years in the US. Despite the prevalence of MR in the elderly population, however, almost half of patients identified with moderate- severe MR are turned down for traditional open-heart surgery due to co-morbidities. MitraClip (MC) is a recent percutaneous approach to treat MR by placement of MC in the center of the mitral valve (MV) to reduce MR. Despite the positive short-term outcomes of the MC procedure in reducing MR, the long-term outcome can be further improved if the effects of MC on both the fluid and solid mechanics of the MV and left ventricle (LV) were available at the time the clip is placed. Recently, we developed a physics-based human cardiac function simulator for the optimal design of a novel annuloplasty ring with a sub-MV element for correction of MR, as well as physics-based simulations of MC placement. The problem with these simulations, as far as clinical applications is concerned, is they are extremely time consuming (3 days to complete simulations on 96-processor cluster). One way to make these time consuming simulations clinically applicable is to run them in advance for a wide range of patient characteristics (e.g., degree of MR, size and shape of the MV and LV, etc.) and MC placements. Currently, when clinicians are ready to place the MC on the MV, they have at their fingertips real-time data on degree of MR, and size and shape of the MV and LV measured using 3D transesophageal echocardiography (RT3D-TEE). We propose the development and validation of a searchable virtual patient atlas (SVPA) that will provide the clinician with detailed predictions of patient outcomes in real time that are based on MC placement and the RT3D-TEE patient-specific data. The first 50 models in our SVPA will be created from existing RT3D-TEE datasets provided by National Heart Centre Singapore, NHCS. Then, we will use our novel-shape dictionary learning models to automatically generate 150 additional models for our SVPA. Machine learning models will be trained with the simulation data in order to create machine learning-FE (ML-FE) surrogates that can predict FE outputs directly from the model geometry. This would enable real-time prediction of patient-specific MC device outcomes. Our preliminary studies using 3D heart simulations clearly show that the main advantage with the ML model over the 3D FE model is speed (i.e., ML runs in 1 CPU second versus 3D FE model runs in 1100 CPU hours!). We will validate the outcome predictions of our SVPA using an additional 50 existing RT3D-TEE datasets with known MC patient outcomes provided by NHCS. After the outcome prediction using SVPA for each case, we will use the dataset and the measured outcome to train the original SVPA further and validate a new dataset with the original and the updated SVPA. We will select the more accurate SVPA (the original or the updated) to determine possible correlations between the primary geometrical parameters and other patient overall biometric information with the MR and optimal MC placement. NARRATIVE A leaky inlet valve of the major pumping chamber of the heart is the most common valvular heart disease in elderly patients.

"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",9976771,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,299863,0.000563783294556407
"Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis Abstract Craniosynostosis affects close to one in 2000 newborns and causes growth restriction perpendicular to the affected suture. Metopic craniosynostosis is the second most common form of craniosynostosis. The metopic suture is an important sight of cranial growth as the brain rapidly expands in the ﬁrst year of life. Patients affected by metopic craniosynostosis will present in the ﬁrst few months of life with varying degrees of narrowing of the forehead and brow, a triangular shaped head, and an abnormal eye position. Surgery is recommended early in childhood to normalize the head shape and expand the restricted skull to prevent complications such as headaches, cognitive impairment, and visual disturbances including blindness.  Imaging with computed tomography (CT) is employed to conﬁrm new diagnoses of metopic craniosynostosis and, together with the physical exam, is used in a descriptive and qualitative manner to assess the degree of head shape abnormality. Several methods have been employed to interpret the information provided in the CT scans to allow surgeons to utilize data for surgical decision making. However, these indices reduce the complex three-dimensional skull dysmorphology into isolated measurements of angles or proportions, require detailed calculations to perform, and no universally accepted standard has emerged so far despite signiﬁcant research efforts and clinical motivation.  In this grant proposal, we aim to increase our understanding of the cranial dysmorphology in patients with metopic craniosynostosis by employing latest results from statistical shape modeling and deep learning. Specif- ically, we will build a statistical shape model of pediatric skulls from CT images of patients with metopic cran- iosynostosis as well as a group of normal controls capturing normal phenotypical shape variations. The distance of a new shape from the normative shape space will represent the proposed Shape Normality Metric (SNM). The SNM will be validated against ratings from experts in the surgical community (current standard of care) who will be asked to assess the dysmorphology of the skulls in our database. To avoid surgeons' subjective bias, we will aggregate their response using statistical methods that compensate for potential individual bias. Finally, to streamline data collection for future research we will develop a head-shape portal that will allow users to upload CT scans of their patients and the system will automatically calculate the SNM.  By developing a severity metric that encompasses the entire extent of dysmorphology in metopic craniosyn- ostosis and establishing a head-shape portal, we will improve our understanding of the spectrum of metopic craniosynostosis, aid in pre-operative and surgical decision making, enable future research, and help facilitate longitudinal outcomes assessments and multi-center communication and collaboration. Narrative This grant proposal aims to improve our understanding of the head shape anomaly associated with metopic craniosynostosis by using recent results from statistical shape analysis and deep learning, with the goal of developing an objective metopic cranioynostosis severity scale. Different from previously proposed metrics, our approach evaluates the entire shape as a whole. With this information, surgeons will be able to objectively determine how severely affected their patients are and will be better able to tailor their interventions to the needs of their individual patients. Additionally, surgeons will be able to better communicate with each other and study the effects of surgical intervention on their patients which will improve patient care in the long run.",Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis,9778826,R21EB026061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Applications Grants', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Deformity', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye Abnormalities', 'Forehead', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Headache', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint structure of suture of skull', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Socialization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereophotogrammetries', 'Stratification', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Trauma patient', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'neural network', 'operation', 'patient stratification', 'power analysis', 'premature', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'self esteem', 'shape analysis', 'standard of care', 'surgery outcome', 'web-based tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2019,307172,-0.01176584115809928
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery SUMMARY - OVERALL In personalized medicine, the care of each patient is guided by his/her unique clinical circumstances. At its foundation, however, this paradigm holds a concurrent need for personalized science, in which technologies are developed and hypothesis explored in light of individual diversity. Critically, this diversity also includes unique microbial populations, which can augment the onset, progression, and treatment of disease. Within the field of benign urology, one of the most common pathologies—urinary tract infections (UTIs)—is also one of the most heterogenous, as the risk factors, symptomatology, and outcomes can vary significantly from patient to patient. Not surprisingly, the complexity of UTIs extends beyond the host, with tremendous genotypic and phenotypic diversity among the species/strains of microbes that elicit these infections. To better align the management of UTIs with the goals of precision care, our understanding of pathophysiology must become more nuanced, as we network in tandem the inherent diversity of host and microbe. To these ends, we propose a resource that provides an interconnected picture of both components, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository (VUIR). With our institution's unique foundation in medical informatics, we will create a searchable database of clinical parameters from bacteriuric patients (many thousands of cases annually), together with microbiologic data on the organisms. In parallel, the paired microbial strains will be stored permanently as a biobank for analysis and experimentation, together with linkage to anonymized versions of patient records within Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative (a filtered version of our electronic health data). The logistical infrastructure for clinical biobanking is also already in place at Vanderbilt via the institutionally-supported microVU initiative, in which microbial isolates from the diagnostic laboratory are repurposed as academic resources. As a basic expansion of these efforts, the VUIR will represent a first-in-kind tool for developing technologies to combat UTIs, while also investigating their underlying pathogenesis. In particular, it could facilitate functional genomic studies that bridge host and pathogen. Demonstrating the resource's value, we will conduct whole-genome sequencing of clinically underrepresented bacterial species, together with genome-wide association studies that focus on the infection phenotypes of the source-patients. In addition to novel virulence factors, we seek to identify elusive genomic determinants that distinguish cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and symptomatic UTI. The molecular basis of UTI-versus-ASB epitomizes a clinical challenge that requires integration of host and pathogen, as provided by the VUIR. Finally, to support the program and its discoveries, we propose an organizational structure of multidisciplinary content-area experts and dedicated support staff. Along with coordinating daily activities and assuring seamless dissemination of data/specimens, this Administrative Core (AdCore) will champion educational activities and additional pilot projects that build upon the resource. In sum, the VUIR stands to generate actionable discoveries from the human and microbial diversity of UTIs—not in spite of it. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERALL Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not only a common urologic ailment, but one of the most widespread medical conditions facing women, men and children around the globe. In order for clinicians to better manage UTIs—and scientists to understand them more deeply—our clinical viewpoint must become personalized, as we study in tandem the afflicted patients and offending pathogens. To these ends, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository will provide a first-in-kind resource for the biomedical community, creating a massive network of patient-level clinical data and banked microbial strains from patients with real-world infections.","The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery",9913350,P20DK123967,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Advisory Committees', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Area', 'Bacteriuria', 'Benign', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Published Comment', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Uropathogen', 'Virulence Factors', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'career development', 'clinical database', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical sequencing', 'combat', 'data mining', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'men', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic microbe', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'urologic', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P20,2019,340000,-0.011149420511466557
"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,9846881,R44AG065118,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Centers for Population Health', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use Effectiveness', 'aging in place', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'database structure', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2019,350000,-0.06816742929248827
"Improving patient and caregiver engagement through the application of data science methods to audio recorded clinic visits stored in personal health libraries PROJECT SUMMARY    Forty to eighty percent of clinic visit information is forgotten by patients immediately post visit, a significant  barrier to self-­management leading to poor health outcomes. Visit summaries can improve recall, yet patient  uptake is limited and clinicians report significant burden in creating summaries for laypeople. Patients are  beginning to audio record visits and clinics are now offering this service. When patients receive a clinic  recording, 71% listen and 68% share it with a caregiver, resulting in improved understanding and self-­ management. Yet, unstructured recordings are difficult to navigate. Personal health libraries (PHLs) may help  patients organize health information;; yet current PHLs do not facilitate clinic-­recordings. The objective of this  project is to develop a PHL that integrates clinic audio-­recordings (Audio-­PHL), using data science methods to  link medical terms from the recording to trustworthy patient resources, which can be retrieved, organized,  edited and shared by patients. The specific aims are: Aim 1 Identify health information seeking needs and  strategies of older adults with multimorbidity and caregivers;; Aim 2 Develop an Audio-­PHL using data science  methods to securely analyze clinic visit recordings and make this information accessible and understandable  for patients;; and Aim 3 Demonstrate the usability and use of an Audio-­PHL in older adults with multimorbidity  and caregivers. Applicants hypothesize: (1) The Audio-­PHL will surpass acceptable usability metrics in older  adults and caregivers and (2) natural language processing (NLP) methods developed for the Audio-­PHL will  accurately identify key visit information (e.g. medication) and connect it to credible patient resources. The  development of the Audio-­PHL follows a user centered design model. In Aim 1, the applicants will use  participatory design activities with 48 end-­users to inform Audio-­PHL design. In Aim 2, the Audio-­PHL will be  created in iterative cycles informed by findings from Aim 1. In Aim 3, extensive usability evaluation will be  conducted in human computer interaction (HCI) laboratory settings to ensure Audio-­PHL surpasses acceptable  usability metrics. Field testing of the Audio-­PHL will follow via a patient-­randomized pilot trial with older adults  with multimorbidity from primary care. Participants (N=70) will receive an Audio-­PHL (intervention) or PHL  (control) with no recordings. Usability metrics and satisfaction will be assessed at one-­month. Preliminary data  on the impact of an Audio-­PHL on patient ability to seek, find and use health information with high confidence,  patient activation and caregiver confidence will also be gathered. The research is innovative because it will  provide patients and caregivers secure access to a PHL based on clinic-­recordings that uses data science  methods to organize visit information and connect it to trusted resources. The results are expected to have a  major positive impact because they will provide proof-­of-­principle for the use of an Audio-­PHL that utilizes the  benefits of clinic recordings through the novel application of data science methods, to improve health outcomes  for older adults with multimorbidity through greater knowledge and confidence in their ability to self-­manage.   PROJECT NARRATIVE    Between 40 – 80% of clinic visit information is forgotten immediately by patients, a significant impediment to  self-­management for older adults with multimorbidity that leads to poor health outcomes. The proposed  research will integrate audio-­recordings of clinic visits into a Personal Health Library (Audio-­PHL), using data

"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,9817043,R37CA242545,"['Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Heart Rate', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'chemotherapy', 'common treatment', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'oncology', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symptom management', 'trial comparing', 'wearable device']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2019,361184,-0.0007892801545329517
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9951760,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2019,366168,-0.0076851556761404725
"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9873378,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,368614,0.015321784751949518
"Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment Diagnosis-based risk adjustment is widely used in the US and abroad for health plan payment, notably for Medicare Parts C and D, for commercial contracting and quality assessment, and in numerous state Medicaid programs. Yet the risk adjustment technology used for payments has not kept up with improved classification systems, larger patient datasets, improved estimation algorithms or recent theoretical and clinical developments. Our work will take advantage of the richer ICD-10-CM classification system, in use since October 2015, with over 5 times as many diagnoses as ICD-9-CM Codes. ICD-10 codes now recognize: left vs. right side for thousands of conditions, distinguish between initial, subsequent and sequela diagnoses, and incorporate hundreds of new clinical, demographic and biometric variables. Based on the ICD-10, more exact models can leverage increased diagnostic coding accuracy to reduce opportunities for gaming or discriminating against patients with conditions who are predicted to be unprofitable. Led by two of the three developers of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS-HCC) existing classification system, our team of physicians, public policy experts, statisticians and economists will comprehensively improve the accuracy of risk adjustment and predictive models using larger sample sizes, clinical judgment and state-of-art economic and statistical modeling. We will also expand the conventional regression methods explored, to include machine learning algorithms, constrained regression, and LASSO estimation. We will calculate a new “appropriateness to include” (ATI) score that captures diagnostic vagueness, discretion and suitability for use in risk adjustment models, and use this score to inform which variables are included in plan payment formulas. Selection incentives remain of concern in public US health plan payments formulas and may be costing Medicare over $5 billion per year (NBER 2017). Prediction and payment models from this project can reduce overpayment and offset plan incentives to skimp on services that attract sick people. To ensure that these models and formulas are useful for enrollees of all ages, they will initially be calibrated and tested on large commercially-insured claims data, covering ages 0 to 64. They will then be validated and refined for Medicare, Medicaid, and state employees using data from All-Payer Claims Data from five states and a second large commercial dataset. We will make development steps, statistical programs, and full details of the classification system and prediction formulas publicly available for comment, refinement, and use by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers. Project Narrative This project will develop new classification systems and new prediction and payment models that take advantage of the fivefold increase in diagnostic codes available with the October 2015 change from ICD- 9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Using data from two national claims datasets and five state all-payer claims datasets that collectively cover over 75 million enrollees, we will identify new, underutilized ICD-10 capabilities, create new clusters of diagnoses useful for prediction, develop new algorithms for using these clusters, and estimate formulas that predict spending, utilization and diverse health care outcomes for all ages. Methods and results will be publicly described and software posted on the web for use in risk adjustment and diverse clinical, financial, policy evaluation, and quality assessment outcomes by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers.",Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment,9775421,R01HS026485,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,384093,0.0017064854753332304
"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions. NARRATIVE Timely acute stroke treatments can be life-saving and reduce disability from stroke; however, a minority of patients receive these treatments in a timely manner or at all.

In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9696812,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,388353,0.015321784751949518
"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,9625162,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'defined contribution', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'effective intervention', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preservation', 'response', 'risk variant', 'success', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,395000,-0.004929970893086266
"The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease Project Summary/Abstract This is a first R01 application from an early stage, new investigator and current NIEHS K01 awardee. Parkinson disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. Years before the diagnosis of PD and the onset of motor symptoms, PD patients develop non-motor symptoms, including, importantly, constipation and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Constipation affects over 80% of PD patients and is one of the strongest risk factors for PD. Recent research shows that the enteric nervous system in the gut and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve which anatomically links the GI system to the brain, are among the first and most severely affected by alpha-synuclein pathology characteristic of PD5 leading to the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal tract might be the site of initiation of PD. We propose to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the relation between human gut microbiome and PD, focusing on the pre- onset microbiome. We will do this by building on an ongoing Department of Defense funded project that has identified participants with pre-parkinson syndrome (PPS - defined as the co- occurrence of constipation, pRBD (probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder) and hyposmia) that in a pilot study has been associated with a ~200 fold increase in PD risk. Studying the microbiome among this group, who are highly likely to develop PD or are already in the premotor state, will give us a unique look at the microbiome in PD patients prior to any potential disease-associated effects of changes in diet and lifestyle that may have confounded prior case-control studies. The proposed study will take advantage of 25 years of prospectively collected data on environmental and dietary exposures and disease outcomes in two prospective cohorts of men and women. Project Narrative Our appreciation of the impact of the gut microbiome on brain health, and especially PD, is in the early stages. This study will be the first to examine the gut microbiome in participants with premotor PD and compare it to healthy controls, controls with constipation and to recently onset PD cases. This project will thus advance our understanding of how the human gut microbiome contributes to the pathophysiology of PD and will contribute to the development of tools needed for a preclinical diagnosis and/or treatment.",The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease,9606513,R01NS097723,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Bacteria', 'Biometry', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Butyrates', 'Caffeine', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Constipation', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Department of Defense', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Enteric Nervous System', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Onset of illness', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteobacteria', 'REM Sleep Behavior Disorder', 'Ralstonia', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Update', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Woman', 'alpha synuclein', 'brain health', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'dorsal motor nucleus', 'dysbiosis', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'hyposmia', 'illness length', 'men', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota profiles', 'motor symptom', 'non-motor symptom', 'posture instability', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'stool sample', 'tool development']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2019,422761,-0.015869270270485326
"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Our goal is to rapidly and accurately identify pathogens and their resistance markers to facilitate accurate antimicrobial therapy, reducing antibiotic overuse in non-infected infants.",Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis,9693150,R01AI134982,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth Weight', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Dyes', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Exposure to', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Microbe', 'Modernization', 'Neonatal', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Very Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Viral', 'Whole Blood', 'Woman', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'circulating DNA', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'early onset', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'intrapartum', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'overtreatment', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic fungus', 'pathogenic virus', 'point of care', 'premature', 'rapid diagnosis', 'resistance gene', 'sample collection', 'septic', 'therapy resistant', 'viral detection']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,423601,-0.006744311928105701
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9739350,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2019,426737,0.011165026119499545
"Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction. We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece- dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as- sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and debilitating disorder. Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu- ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to 75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir- ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time- and resource-intensive. In this secondary data analysis, we will examine methods for automating delirium recog- nition and risk prediction in electronic health records using machine learning and natural language processing computer algorithms, which in turn will lead to improved care for this serious but often overlooked disorder.",Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records,9637480,R01AG060993,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alabama', 'Algorithms', 'Ally', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational algorithm', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Staff', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care costs', 'confusion assessment method', 'data mining', 'epidemiology study', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'health care settings', 'high dimensionality', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phrases', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'ward']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2019,432969,0.001335061914742814
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia,9614566,R01DC013063,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cathodes', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Love', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug discovery', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'forgetting', 'frontal lobe', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'gaze', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sound', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'supervised learning', 'treatment services', 'voltage']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2019,438611,-0.0304571871639391
"Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction Project Summary Electronic health records (EHR) provide rich source of data about representative populations and are yet to be fully utilized to enhance clinical decision-making. Conventional approaches in clinical decision-making start with the identification of relevant biomarkers based on subject-matter knowledge, followed by detailed but limited analysis using these biomarkers exclusively. As the current scientific literature indicates, many human disorders share a complex etiological basis and exhibit correlated disease progression. Therefore, it is desirable to use comprehensive patient data for patient similarity. This proposal focuses on deriving a comprehensive and integrated score of patient similarity from complete patient characteristics currently available, including but not limited to 1) demographic similarity; 2) genetic similarity; 3) clinical phenotype similarity; 4) treatment similarity; and 5) exposome similarity (here exposome defined as all available attributes of the living environment an individual is exposed to), when some of the aspects may overlap and interact. We will optimize information fusion and task-dependent feature selection for assessing patient similarity for clinical risk prediction. Since currently there does not exist a pipeline that is able to extract executable complete patient determinant data, to achieve the research goal described above, we propose first deliver an open- source data preparation pipeline that is based on a widely used clinical data standard, the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model (CMD) version 5.2. Moreover, to mitigate common missingness and sparsity challenges in clinical data, we describe the first attempt to represent patients' sparse clinical information with missingness, including diagnosis information, medication data, treatment intervention, with a fixed-length feature vector (i.e. the Patient2Vec). This project has four specific aims. Aim 1 is to develop a clinical data processing pipeline for harmonizing patient information from multiple sources into a standards-based uniformed data representation and to evaluate its efficiency, interoperability, and accuracy. Aim 2 is to leverage a powerful machine learning technique, Document2Vec, from the natural language processing literature, to create an open-source Patient2Vec framework for the derivation of informative numerical representations of patients. Aim 3 is to develop a unified machine learning clinical- outcome-prediction framework for Optimized Patient Similarity Fusion (OptPSF) that integrates traditional medical covariates with the derived numerical patient representations from Patient2Vec (Aim 2) for improved clinical risk prediction. Aim 4 is to evaluate our similarity framework for predicting 1) the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in general EHR patient population and 2) the risk of death among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The project focus on developing a novel data science pipeline which includes a clinical data processing pipeline to format comprehensive patient health determinants from a variety of sources of clinical, genomic, socioenvironmental data, and a clinical-outcome-prediction framework that optimally fuses relevant patient health determinants to define patient similarity for improved clinical risk predictions.",Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction,9687065,R01LM013061,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'computerized data processing', 'data modeling', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'health data', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'socioeconomics', 'support tools', 'vector']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,448622,0.0010294713731219588
"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,9938134,R01HS027369,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,497444,0.009473454425930792
"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,9819327,R01DK116986,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'base', 'case-based', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injury prevention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'prevent']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,512304,0.0039564846957811164
"Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data It is a common clinical occurrence that neuroimaging scans obtained in the course of routine clinical care discover a prior brain infarction in patients with no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Indeed, epidemiologic studies indicate that silent brain infarctions (SBI) are far more common than strokes; MRI- defined SBI can be detected in ~20% of the healthy elderly. In these studies based on screened patients, the findings have been shown to be associated with subtle, typically unrecognized, deficits in physical and cognitive function. These imaging findings are also strong, independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. Despite the very high prevalence of SBI in screened populations, and their serious consequences, little is known about the significance or the appropriate management of SBI when discovered incidentally in routine care. While there is strong evidence that antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy are effective in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke, the degree to which these results apply to patients with SBI is unclear. Because patients with SBI define a population that falls in between primary and secondary stroke prevention, the approach to these patients is marked by uncertainty and practice variation, making it an ideal condition for observational comparative effectiveness research. Nonetheless, there are serious challenges for the study of SBI. As patients have no overt symptoms, recruitment into a trial can be problematic. Comparative effectiveness research on SBI, using routinely collected data and leveraging the variation in care of these patients, is impeded by the fact that there are no ICD codes for SBI, and it is generally not included in structured fields of electronic health records (EHR) as it is typically considered an incidental finding. In order to establish the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for SBI in a large, heterogeneous population, we propose to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to identify individuals with SBI through the automated review of neuroradiology reports. We have performed preliminary work to demonstrate that such an approach is feasible. We will then apply state-of-the-science observational comparative effectiveness methods in a massive database with linked EHR and claims data to examine the effectiveness of statins and antiplatelet agents in preventing future stroke and dementia. Thus, our aims are: Aim 1: We will develop NLP algorithms that can accurately identify cases of SBI and white matter disease (WMD) in two different health systems. Aim 2: We will port, refine, and validate the NLP algorithm in a large heterogeneous database including more than 600 hospitals and 6500 clinics and identify a large cohort of patients with routinely-discovered SBI and WMD. Aim 3: We will characterize the cohort with respect to age- specific prevalence of SBI, management patterns, and the risk of future stroke and dementia associated with SBI and WMD. Aim 4: We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of preventive therapies (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally-discovered SBI. The goal of this project is to improve the evidence base for the prevention of stroke in patients with “silent brain infarct”—i.e., a stroke on neuroimaging (head CT or MRI) but no clinical evidence of a stroke. We will develop a computer-based algorithm using a technology known as natural language processing that can accurately identify cases of silent brain infarction among a large population of adults on whom neuroimages have been obtained, but who are without a history of clinically-evident cerebrovascular disease. We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of medications (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally discovered and reported SBI.",Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data,9726113,R01NS102233,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'American Stroke Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Infarction', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'effectiveness research', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'repository', 'routine care', 'screening', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,531215,0.020356194093649412
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9650623,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical predictors', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'stroke risk', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2019,535600,0.018086127110272358
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem.

"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9988737,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,544562,-0.018790341596653038
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,9643493,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,545657,0.0019780326105214466
"A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk Abstract About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over $130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff & nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense, patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced, human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients, avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed hospital. This proposal aligns with NINR’s cross-cutting focus areas of Promoting Innovation and 21st Century Nurse Scientists, while applying the principles of patient self-management and wellness to the acute care environment, where the outcomes driven by our patient engagement and support platform will have an outsized, immediate cost benefit to enable rapid scaling and dissemination.

"STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) are debilitating conditions affecting more than 5 million Americans in 2014. It is projected that 8.4 million people with be diagnosed with ADRD over the next 15 years and health care costs attributable to ADRD are projected to be more than $1.2 trillion by 2050. Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are common and often involve aggressive behavior towards family caregivers (CG) in response to unmet needs, discomfort, or frustration. BPSD frequently lead to CG seeking medication to control patient symptoms. Antipsychotic use in persons with dementia (PWD) more than doubles mortality risk. The Choosing Wisely Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics Society both recommend against prescribing antipsychotics as a first-line treatment for BPSD. Behavioral interventions such as STAR-Caregivers are efficacious first-line treatments for managing BPSD endorsed by the Administration on Aging. However, the programs have not been implemented widely – partly due to the intensity/cost of the programs and difficulty conducting outreach. No study has investigated CG willingness to reduce or discontinue antipsychotic use. We propose a Stage III clinical trial to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of STAR Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR- VTF) in which (a) training materials are delivered electronically and learning is self-directed, (b) caregivers have two in-home visits with a social worker and (c) where caregivers receive support from a social worker via secure messaging (email) within a web-based portal. We will compare outcomes in the STAR-VTF group to an attention control group (mailed material plus generic secure messages). Our specific aims are: (1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of STAR-VTF to caregivers; (2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program from the payer perspective; and (3) Test the hypotheses that (H1) caregiver participants in STAR-VTF will have lower levels of caregiver burden at 8 weeks and 6 months compared to an attention control group; and (H2) PWD participants in STAR-VTF will have lower rates of daily antipsychotic medication use at 6 months compared to attention control. We propose to recruit 100 CG-PWD dyads (50 in each arm). This will be the first study to test a low intensity, self-directed caregiver training program with secure message support from social workers. It will also be the first study to measure changes in antipsychotic medication use by PWD after CG training. The study is also innovative because it brings together leading experts in caregiver training, health information management, and care management. Third, this will be the first study to use automated data and natural language processing to identify potential caregivers in need of education/support at a time when antipsychotic medication use begins. Results of this study will inform a future multi-site trial in the Mental Health Research Network. NARRATIVE Our study evaluates the effectiveness of a caregiver outreach, training, and support program for caregivers of people with dementia who are using antipsychotic medication to manage agitation/aggression. We will conduct a randomized trial of the caregiver program compared to a control group to measure differences in caregiver burden and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication use. The results will help in expanding access to and delivery of empirically supported behavioral health services for caregivers and people with dementia.",STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up,9791152,R01AG061926,"['Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'American Psychiatric Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'E-learning', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Family Caregiver', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Improve Access', 'Information Management', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Program Acceptability', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Site', 'Social Workers', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'Travel', 'Washington', 'arm', 'attentional control', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'caregiver depression', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multi-site trial', 'outreach', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'program costs', 'programs', 'psychological symptom', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'response', 'retiree', 'secondary outcome', 'time use', 'urgent care', 'virtual', 'willingness']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,546052,0.00268495476828268
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke.

"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,9771462,R01DK116163,"['5 year old', 'Acute Diarrhea', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bangladesh', 'Beds', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'IV Fluid', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'International Unit', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Rehydration Solutions', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diarrheal disease', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'international center', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2019,556605,-0.0149017524774225
"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"Assessment of Peripherally Circulating Plasma Proteins and Clinical Risks to Differentiate Epileptic Seizure from Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure Project Summary / Abstract Accurately diagnosing epilepsy is very challenging and time consuming because clinicians rarely observe the actual seizure, and there are many different types of seizures and epilepsy syndromes with differing presentations. Furthermore, other neurological disorders can be mimics of seizures leading to erroneous diagnosis, inappropriate treatments with significant potential adverse events, incorrect prognoses, and significant waste of healthcare resources. A primary indication that is mistaken for epilepsy is psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES) which is commonly misdiagnosed even by seasoned clinicians. Patients that suffer PNES events experience convulsive events which are similar to epileptic seizures but do not arise from aberrant, synchronous, electrical activity in the brain. Rendering a definitive diagnosis of either PNES or epilepsy is critical to long-term patient health and outcome. In many cases, patients suffering PNES events are prescribed anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs) and suffer unnecessary side effects. Alternatively, patients that are suspected to suffer PNES, but actually have epilepsy and are not treated with AEDs, are at risk of experiencing seizures and even sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Currently, obtaining a definitive diagnosis of epilepsy or PNES is expensive and inconvenient for patients as it may require inpatient evaluation and a battery of costly tests. Thus, a critical gap in our clinical assessment of seizures, be it epileptic or psychogenic, is an accurate diagnostic blood test that can be used to stratify transient neurological events as either PNES or epilepsy. Towards developing this test, Evogen has developed an innovative informatic approach that incorporates all available clinical information and our protein biomarker approach to detect seizure using an artificial intelligence approach of machine learning. To confirm our previous results, Evogen proposes an epilepsy monitoring unit-based all-comers study which will collect both blood samples and clinical information from patients’ ES and PNES events. Protein biomarker concentrations will be determined and combined with clinical information using a machine learning approach to create a diagnostic algorithm that will provide a probabilistic score that a patient experienced an ES or PNES event. The test will have a profound impact on diagnosis and treatment of both ES and PNES. We believe this test will have an immediate impact on identifying which patients require EMU evaluation. Typically, one third of patients that visit the EMU for a definitive diagnosis suffer from PNES events and represent a large burden to the tertiary epilepsy centers. When patients are referred for EMU monitoring, they are sequentially put on a waiting list and infrequently is any triage used. Therefore, a test that can aid in routing patients with psychogenic events to the appropriate care will increase the accessibility for patients with a high probability of epilepsy. The work proposed here is the first step necessary to confirm pilot results. Upon confirmation, a streamlined development plan has been created to collect all of the information required for CLIA accreditation and bring the test to market. Project Narrative Differentiating epileptic seizures from psychogenic nonepileptic seizure is a substantially unmet medical need. Current tools to differentiate between epileptic seizures and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures have limited performance, high costs and limited availability. A diagnostic test that indicates if a patient recently experienced an epileptic seizure or psychogenic event would provide physicians with objective, actionable data that can result in improved clinical care, patient outcomes and healthcare system savings.",Assessment of Peripherally Circulating Plasma Proteins and Clinical Risks to Differentiate Epileptic Seizure from Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure,9846171,R43NS113724,"['Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'CCL8 gene', 'CLIA certified', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Electroencephalography', 'Enrollment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry Standard', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Intercellular adhesion molecule 1', 'Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Seasons', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'TNF gene', 'TNFSF10 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'protein biomarkers', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'wasting']",NINDS,"EVOGEN, INC.",R43,2019,562119,0.01255652159098886
"Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark's population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation. This will inform the development of interventions to address the neighborhood factors that affect Alzheimer's disease.",Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors,9745267,R01AG063385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Attention', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Blood Vessels', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Experience', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Minority Groups', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Refugees', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Social Sciences', 'Socialization', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Violence', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical development', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'deprivation', 'diabetes risk', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'residence', 'response', 'social', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'treatment effect', 'vascular risk factor', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,567836,-0.02855609230414119
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9685235,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cardiovascular insufficiency', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual response', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,586227,0.019162286823354174
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9727956,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Drug Screening', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Prescription opioid overdose', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'classification trees', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid abuse', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'random forest', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,588500,-0.013929949578023721
"Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advanced heart failure is characterized by progressive debilitating symptoms and repeated hospitalizations that degrade quality of life. There is no one criterion to diagnose advanced heart failure; the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to populations. As such, our knowledge of advanced heart failure is truncated and skewed as it is based on information from referral populations and convenience samples. Enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology, experiences, and outcomes of patients with advanced heart failure is critical to developing interventions to improve care and quality of life. To address these gaps in knowledge, this proposal leverages diverse data sources and novel applications of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the epidemiology and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. In Aim 1, we will apply an advanced heart failure definition to a geographically-defined population of individuals with heart failure under the auspices of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. We will determine the prevalence of advanced heart failure, examine the demographic and clinical features of the population, and evaluate the timing of its development and association with risk of outcomes. In Aim 2, we will use machine learning techniques to develop computer algorithms (computable phenotypes) to identify patients with advanced heart failure using electronic health record data. We will then leverage the infrastructure of the National Patient- Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) to validate the performance of the computable phenotypes across diverse patient populations. This will enable the accurate and efficient identification of advanced HF for future applications. In Aim 3, we will use the computable phenotype developed in Aim 2 to prospectively identify individuals living with advanced HF. We will then assess their treatment and illness burdens using a combination of surveys and semi-structured qualitative interviews. This information will be used to inform the development of a palliative care intervention that is tailored to the needs of patients with advanced HF. We will assess the acceptability of the tailored palliative care intervention to stakeholders (patients, caregivers, clinicians). The results of these analyses will provide synergistic information to clarify the epidemiology, case mix, burdens, and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. They will provide a prototype palliative care intervention tailored to decrease burden and improve quality of life in advanced heart failure. Finally, the computable phenotype developed can be used to identify patients with advanced HF for future quality improvement programs, observational studies, and interventional research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with heart failure (HF) develop end-stage, refractory disease (advanced HF), characterized by progressive debilitating HF symptoms that interfere with daily life. However, our knowledge of the epidemiology and impact of advanced HF is severely limited because the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to diverse populations. In this study, we will evaluate the epidemiology and outcomes of advanced HF in a geographically-defined population, develop computer algorithms that can accurately and efficiently identify advanced HF, and assess the burdens and experiences of patients living with advanced HF to enable the design of new interventions to improve care and quality of life.",Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes,9815239,R01HL144529,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Mixes', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Refractory Disease', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Ventricular Function', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'rural setting']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,598123,0.017221630670750648
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma SUMMARY: In 2016, nearly 50,000 adults in the US were diagnosed with oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and nearly 10,000 died from the disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as the most common cause of oropharyngeal (OP) SCC in the US. Although concomitant chemo- and radio-therapy is the most common treatment choice in patients with advanced OP-SCC, they have substantial short- and long- term morbidity and result in increased health care costs in patients who are cured of their cancers. These patients live with sometimes disabling morbidity for many years post-treatment. For these reasons, it has been suggested that therapy in lower risk patients might be de-escalated. There is also a higher risk cohort of patients in whom treatment with chemo-radiation may be insufficient, often resulting in distant metastatic failure. As such, these patients may require intensified therapies to improve outcomes. This is an agonizing choice for patients and their doctors, however. While patients do not want to be sickened by morbid treatments, they are obviously concerned about having the best chance at cure. Unfortunately, there currently are no companion diagnostic tools to identify which HPV + OPSCC patients are at (1) low risk of recurrence such that they can be treated safely to high cure rates with de-escalated therapy; (2) higher risk of failure despite aggressive high dose chemoradiation in whom treatment intensification strategies should be studied.  Recently, we developed a quantitative histomorphometric based image risk classifier (QuHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to predict progression in HPV+ OP-SCC patients; the current version of QuHbIC has already been validated in >400 patients and found to be superior to clinical variables in outcome prediction. In this Academic-Industry Partnership we seek to further improve predictive accuracy of QuHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as promising markers of unfavorable prognosis in HPV+ OP-SCC. We also seek to create a pre-commercial QuHbIC companion diagnostic test that is ready for clinical use in risk stratification in p16+ OP-SCC. QuHbIC will be trained on >700 retrospectively identified HPV + OP-SCC whole tissue slide images with associated long term outcome data and then validated on 440 cases from randomized, controlled, multi-institutional RTOG 0129 and 0522 clinical trials.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) computational histomorphometry from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve University, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in HPV+ OPSCC from Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic and, (3) Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company that will bring quality management systems and production software standards to establish QuHbIC as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for oropharyngeal cancers. Project Relevance: In this project we propose to optimize and validate a quantitative histomorphometric-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to better risk stratify survival among p16+ (Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related) OPSCC patients. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be either ""de-escalated”, left as standard, or even potentially escalated, depending on risk status.",Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma,9663910,R01CA220581,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International Union Against Cancer', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stage Grouping', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Universities', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'common treatment', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'economic need', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'pharynx squamous cell carcinoma', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,614169,-0.04156100242475811
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9743884,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2019,623653,-0.0076851556761404725
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA).

"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes. Narrative The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the search of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. We will develop methods for feature engineering, electronic phenotyping and patient matching from real-world EHR data.

"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes. This innovative study will rigorously assess whether the implementation of an 'anesthesiology control tower', with sophisticated decision-support tools, improves the care, safety and outcomes of surgical patients.","TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial",9738886,R01NR017916,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Certified registered nurse anesthetist', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Delirium', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enabling Factors', 'Engineering', 'Evidence based practice', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Network-based', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Perioperative complication', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Update', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'postoperative delirium', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'routine care', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'waiver']",NINR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,640937,0.0182580289525344
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,9703894,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2019,642740,-0.01447294979737545
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9693333,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data Methods', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,646418,0.028666112330687506
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,9631317,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'hospital readmission', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,656406,0.004457449319885521
"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9722313,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,658069,0.014085507623504934
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients.

"Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities Project Summary/Abstract From 2000-2014, hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, incidence rates increased nearly 4% per year, while most cancers in the United States were on the decline. HCC disproportionately impacts minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. To inform primary prevention strategies that will reduce disparities in HCC risk, we need to determine the relative contribution of well- established and emerging (e.g., hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, alcohol, smoking, cirrhosis, NAFLD, metabolic disorders, diabetes, HIV infection), and novel (e.g., medications, comorbidities, neighborhood attributes) risk factors to these disparities. To inform secondary and tertiary prevention strategies to reduce disparities in HCC burden, we need to understand the multilevel factors that contribute to HCC surveillance disparities. Answering these gaps in knowledge requires a robust high-quality study with a sample enriched for racial/ethnic minorities. Thus, we propose to leverage existing multi-disciplinary collaborations to develop an integrated dataset that includes electronic health records (EHR) data linked to population-based state cancer registry data and geospatial contextual data. This multilevel resource will include data on nearly 2.3 million individuals from three healthcare systems (mixed payer, integrated healthcare, federally qualified health centers) in California and Hawaii, thus providing diversity in healthcare settings and enrichment for racial/ethnic minorities: 59,400 are Black, 189,500 are Hispanic, and 441,700 are Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI). With this resource, we specifically aim to: (1) assess the relative importance of established and emerging examine the extent to which these factors independently and jointly contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk; (2) discover novel risk factors and assess their relative importance to HCC risk; and (3) assess racial/ethnic disparities in adherence with surveillance for HCC as well as examine the extent to which these disparities are attributable to modifiable individual-, clinician-, system-, and neighborhood factors (Aim 3). For Aim 1, using prospective data, we will assess the relative importance of risk factors and their contribution to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk with causal inference methods. For Aim 2, we will apply innovative machine learning methods to identify novel factors and validate their associations with HCC risk using modeling strategy from Aim 1. For Aim 3, we will use multilevel generalized linear regression to investigate the patient, clinician, institutional and geographic factors that contribute to disparities in HCC surveillance. Given the importance of sex and age/birth cohort for HCC risk, these social determinants will be considered together with race/ethnicity using an intersectional approach. By applying a multilevel framework to understand how biological, clinical, and social factors at multiple levels contribute to HCC disparities in incidence and surveillance, the proposed study will identify modifiable factors that can be translated to the clinical and community settings to collaboratively identify strategies to ameliorate racial/ethnic disparities in HCC. Project Narrative While most cancer incidence and mortality in the United States are declining, the burden of liver cancer is increasing; yet, we do not understand what causes 40% of these cancers. Furthermore, this cancer impacts racial/ethnic groups disproportionately, with minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. Therefore we propose to study the relative contribution of established and emerging risk factors, discover and validate novel risk factors, and to understand patient, clinician, healthcare system and geographic factors that influence surveillance; these findings can then be used to inform strategies in clinical and community settings to reduce the burden of liver cancer particularly for those at high risk.",Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities,9679122,R01CA225478,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Alcohols', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'HIV Infections', 'Hawaii', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Maintenance Organizations', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive measure', 'Primary Prevention', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'built environment', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer health disparity', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'data registry', 'disparity reduction', 'electronic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'intersectionality', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'sex', 'social', 'social disparities', 'socioeconomics', 'tertiary prevention']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,680549,-0.05323561485366474
"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved evidence-based care approaches to diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether.",Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia,9739933,R01MH117172,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disorientation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Psychology', 'Source', 'Stigmatization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital media', 'digital models', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'first episode schizophrenia', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'medical complication', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'stem', 'support tools', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'volunteer', 'willingness', 'young adult']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,682250,0.0035516140506507837
"Contextualized daily prediction of lapse risk in opioid use disorder by digital phenotyping PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid use disorder is increasingly widespread, leading to devastating consequences and costs for patients and their families, friends, and communities. Available treatments for opioid and other substance use disorders (SUD) are not successful at sustaining sobriety. The vast majority of people with SUD relapse within a year. Critically, they often fail to detect dynamic, day-by-day changes in their risk for relapse and do not adequately employ skills they developed or take advantage of support available through continuing care. The broad goals of this project are to develop and deliver a highly contextualized, lapse risk prediction models for forecasting day-by-day probability of opioid and other drug use lapse among people pursuing drug abstinence. This lapse risk prediction model will be delivered within the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) mobile app, which has been established by RCT as a state-of-the-art mHealth system for providing continuing care services for alcohol and substance use disorders. To accomplish these broad goals, a diverse sample of 480 participants with opioid use disorder who are pursing abstinence will be recruited. These participants will be followed for 12 months of their recovery, with observations occurring as early as one week post-abstinence and as late as 18 months post-abstinence across participants in the sample. Well-established distal, static relapse risk signals (e.g., addiction severity, comorbid psychopathology) will be measured on intake. A range of more proximal, time-varying opioid (and other drug use) lapse risk signals will also be collected via participants’ smartphones. These signals include self-report surveys every two months, daily ecological momentary assessments, daily video recovery “check-ins”, voice phone call and text message logs, text message content, moment-by-moment location (via smartphone GPS and location services), physical activity (via smartphone sensors), and usage of the mobile A-CHESS Recovery Support app. The predictive power of these risk signals will be further increased by anchoring them within an inter-personal context of known people, locations, dates, and times that support or detract from participants’ abstinence efforts. Machine learning methods will be used to train, validate, and test opioid (and other drug) lapse risk prediction models based on these contextualized static and dynamic risk signals. These lapse risk prediction models will provide participant specific, day-by-day probabilistic forecast of a lapse to opioid (or other drug) use among opioid abstinent individuals. These lapse risk prediction models will be formally added to the A-CHESS continuing care mobile app at the completion of the project for use in clinical care. These project goals position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project’s goals are to develop and deliver a real-time model for forecasting day-by-day opioid use lapse among abstinent patients with opioid use disorder.

"Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients Project Summary / Abstract If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) during surgery, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve postoperative outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The goal of this proposal is to develop, validate, and test real-time intraoperative risk prediction tools based on electronic health record (EHR) data and high-fidelity physiological waveforms to predict CRI and make the databases of intraoperative data and waveforms used for these developments freely accessible. This is extremely relevant because although 5.7 million Americans are admitted to an Intensive Care Units (ICU) in one year, more than 42 millions undergo surgery annually. Previous and ongoing studies conducted in the ICU and in the step down unit have built the architecture to collect real-time high-fidelity physiological waveform data streams and integrate them with patient demographics from the EHR to build large data sets, and derive actionable fused parameters based on machine learning (ML) analytics as well as display information in real time at the bedside to drive clinical decision support (CDS) in the critical care setting. The goal of this proposal is to apply these ML approaches to the complex and time compressed environment of high-risk surgery where greater patient and disease variability exist and shorter period of time is available to deliver truly personalized medicine approaches. The work will be initiated using an already existing annotated intraoperative database from the University of California Irvine including EHR and high-fidelity waveform data. This operating room database already exists and needs only to be extracted. This data will be used for the initial training and development of the ML model that will then be tested on prospectively collected University of California Los Angeles and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center databases. Simultaneously, this approach will use existing knowledge of CRI patterns derived from previous step down unit / intensive care unit cohorts, MIMIC II data, University of California Irvine data, and animal studies to create smart alarms and graphic user interface for clinical decision support based on functional hemodynamic monitoring principles. The next step will then leverage the focus on the issues and strengths of the intraoperative environment, some of which can be listed as: 1) Known patients characteristics before surgery to define pre-stress baseline, allowing functional hemodynamic monitoring stress evaluations, preconditioning, and other preoperative calibrations, 2) High degree of direct observation and data density during most phases of surgery allowing close semi-autonomous monitoring and titration of novel treatment algorithms early, 3) Defined stages in the initial part of surgery (induction, intubation, skin incision) allowing ML approaches to build large common relational database registries, and 4) Defined surgical procedure and stressors (anesthesia induction, intra-abdominal air insufflation, and other surgery-specific interventions), which will alter the impact of CRI on measured variables. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to predict parsimoniously cardiorespiratory instability, etiology and response to treatment in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. Using high-fidelity intraoperative physiological waveform data augmented with extensive electronic health record derived annotation and applying machine learning approaches we will characterize and quantify common patterns in subjects destined to develop cardiorespiratory instability during high-risk surgery. We will use these inputs in simulated real-time bedside management to develop an iteratively designed prototype clinical decision support system suitable for intraoperative care.","Machine Learning of Physiological Waveforms and Electronic Health Record Data to Predict, Diagnose, and Treat Hemodynamic Instability in Surgical Patients",9643500,R01HL144692,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hypotension', 'Injury', 'Insufflation', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'electronic data', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'information display', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'iterative design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'preconditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'relational database', 'response', 'simulation', 'stressor', 'support tools', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,694170,0.016202985781894046
"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and efficacy.",Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy,9826831,R01AR074500,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitor', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Engraftment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structural Genes', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovitis', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'arthritis therapy', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'chronic autoimmune disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'germ free condition', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'joint destruction', 'joint injury', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome components', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'polyglutamates', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'rRNA Genes', 'recruit', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'rheumatologist', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'therapy outcome']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,734366,-0.018933809131913976
"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (“tele-SUD”) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder,9835697,R01DA048533,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental disorders', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'methamphetamine use', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'rural area', 'screening', 'treatment duration']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2019,735192,-0.0013260053219310433
"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9609472,R01HL126700,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Apnea', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Pulse Rates', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic health disparity', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'portability', 'post stroke', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke trials', 'surveillance study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,739858,0.028037570847905497
"ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY Need: Nearly half (34 million) of all hypertension (HTN) patients have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. Despite medication and life-style management, the cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs. HTN is the leading cause for stroke, heart failure (HF) and myocardial infarction (MI) hospitalizations. Clinical trials have shown that active pharmacological treatment management of HTN to BP goal reduces the incidence of stroke by 35-40%, MI by 15-25%, and HF by up to 64%.  Solution: In response to the national “epidemic” of uncontrolled HTN, Optima Integrated Health has developed optima4BP. optima4BP is an artificial intelligence (AI) that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized. The innovation was developed with the physician in mind by simulating the in-office clinical reasoning treatment decision process. optima4BP is a physician decision support aid that safely and when needed optimizes the pharmacological treatment for HTN. optima4BP is interoperable in real-time with the EpicÒ Electronic Health Record (EHR), constantly evaluating the efficacy of patients’ current treatment and the requirement for optimization. When a treatment optimization is needed, optima4BP communicates directly with the treating physician by providing a recommendation in the EHR In-Basket that can be accepted or declined.  Goal of Direct to Phase II: ARTERY Outcomes [tailored drug titration through artificial intelligence: an interventional study] is a 12 months follow-up, randomized clinical trial (n=300) that: Evaluates optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control [Aim 1], and Ensures Data Systems Maintenance [Aim 2].  Aim 1. Evaluate optima4BP’s safety and efficacy in improving HTN control. We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial (ARTERY Outcomes) at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC). We will investigate the safety and efficacy of optima4BP in improving BP control compared to standard of care (SoC). The primary end-point will examine the reduction in systolic BP (SBP) between in-office start and end of study. Milestone: optima4BP reduces SBP by >6 mmHg than SoC. The safety of using optima4BP will be investigated as a secondary outcome in the context of reported adverse events (AEs).  Aim 2. Ensure data systems maintenance (DSM). DSM is a critical activity that includes optimization, error correction, deletion of discarded features and enhancement of existing features. UCSF MC and Optima IT teams will address (1) Data Acquisition upgrades and patches of any system/component within the data flow; and (2) Surveillance management that addresses systems errors, and performs audits/upgrades on the data repository [data warehouse]. Milestone: Ensure the validity of the collected-processed-analyzed data.  Commercial Application: With a growing need for value-based care, optima4BP is strongly positioned to support this specific care coordination model. Our goal is to simplify the care management of high blood pressure (BP) with the goal of reaching BP control, demonstrated to reduce the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. We will investigate the benefits of optima4BP artificial intelligence that transforms the episodic and reactive nature of uncontrolled BP pharmacological treatment management into a process that is continuous, proactive, and personalized.",ARTERY Outcomes: tAilored dRug Titration through artificial intElligence: an inteRventional studY,9840429,R44HL149428,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Hypertension', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Service delivery model', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'adverse event risk', 'arm', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care coordination', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data warehouse', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'medication compliance', 'primary endpoint', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'stroke incidence', 'treatment arm', 'treatment choice', 'treatment optimization', 'web services']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2019,739992,0.015739520528636468
"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers.

"Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare Project Summary With newly available electronic health data and a massive increase in processing power, data-driven personalized medicine is just now becoming possible.1 However, advances to improve health care are inherently limited by data quality. One of the most used sources of data, the patient problem list, is also the greatest source of data inaccuracy. According to recent studies, the patient problem list is often less than 50% accurate in documenting the most critical conditions.2 3 4 5 These errors exacerbate inefficiencies throughout the American health care system from care delivery to quality improvement. Primary care physicians rely on problem lists to develop transitional treatment plans for the 68 million Americans who change providers every year. Errors related to care transitions harm more than 1.5 million people each year in the United States, costing the nation an estimated $3.5 billion annually.6 Population health efforts, a cornerstone of value-based healthcare, rely on problem lists to determine risk levels and deployment of resources. These efforts cannot succeed if the source data produce faulty results. This application seeks to enable better individual patient care, enhanced population health management, and effective downstream analytics by building an automated problem list builder, which provides an accurate and granular account of the patient’s medical conditions. If the program is successful, one of the greatest technical risks in value-based healthcare will be addressed. Phase I exceeded success criteria in proving feasibility of core modules in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence. Based on Phase I success, implementation pathways are demonstrated through pilots with one of the largest US healthcare systems and one of the largest global biotechnology firms. The team is comprised of commercial and academic leaders in the field of NLP-based products applied to value-based healthcare. Project Narrative VMT proposes to use advanced semantic technologies and artificial intelligence to enhance the individualized patient problem list, which frequently has 50% or lower accuracy for common conditions such as cancer, smoking, and heart failure. 1 2 3 The problem list represents source data in care delivery, population health, shared-risk contracting, and research.

"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),9738159,R01HL141916,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Agreement', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Environment', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Melons', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Normal Range', 'Nurses', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Refractory', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Hemorrhage', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'non-invasive monitor', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,763789,0.02686725668087098
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9610723,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,794994,-0.00949588252319996
"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. AC decision-making has become more complex in recent years with the introduction of several target specific oral AC agents. It remains challenging to advise older AF patients about AC since they are frequently at high risk for stroke and complications from AC, particularly bleeding, and data are limited on real-world outcomes of AC among vulnerable populations. Our project, Detecting bleeding Events using Electronic records for Prediction in Atrial Fibrillation (DEEP AF), will leverage novel biomedical natural language processing (NLP) approaches to integrate bleeding-related information from both the structured and unstructured EHR records and statistical and deep learning approaches to predict risk of bleeding on AF patients on AC therapy. DEEP AF will address present knowledge gaps to accurately identify bleeding events from longitudinal electronic health records and to improve bleeding prediction accuracy and focus on modifiable, clinically relevant risk factors, thereby facilitating future large-scale comparative effectiveness studies evaluating AC agents, and helping clinicians develop better approaches to weighing AC risks and benefits.

"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research,9641499,R01MH118233,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data resource', 'delay sex', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'sex', 'support tools']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,855687,-0.0370152884861007
"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization. The tool will be validated across three large and diverse health systems and released as an open source application (SMART App), increasing its potential for rapid implementation in health systems and clinical care.",Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis,9660167,R01MH116042,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Boston', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'outpatient programs', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'socioeconomics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'tool', 'treatment program']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,892010,0.014110390094069948
"Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches Project Summary  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, affecting every 200-1000 people, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria. FH leads to lifetime raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a high risk for premature atherosclerosis and downstream coronary heart disease. FH is designated as Tier 1 disease by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, notably one of only three such diseases, because it is common, is associated with a high risk of premature illness, and is treatable with lifestyle or medications. Great uncertainty exists about the optimal approach to FH screening, which is reflected in conflicting recommendations in national screening guidelines.  We propose to synthesize high quality data from national surveys and population-based cohort studies in a health policy computer simulation model comparing the health and economic value of different FH screening strategies. This study will prioritize the optimal approaches to FH screening in the U.S. population, identifying optimal initial screening age and defining the role of genetic testing in screening.  We have assembled a team of experts in pediatric preventive cardiology, decision analysis, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, population genetics, biostatistics, health economic evaluation, and computer simulation modeling in order to evaluate and compare different FH screening strategies in children and adults. We aim to use this expertise and these methods in order to:   Quantify diagnostic yield, clinical effectiveness, and economic value of universal FH phenotype  screening in childhood or adulthood, and the added value of FH genotype screening   Compare universal FH screening to the alternatives of using family history or a Big Data-based  algorithm to direct targeted screening limited to children and adults with possible FH diagnosis   Quantify the health and economic value of cascade screening families of FH cases  We hypothesize that FH screening in childhood will be the highest value screening strategy in the U.S. population, and that genetic testing will improve diagnosis and treatment decisions most in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., borderline high cholesterol or absent family history). We hypothesize that a machine-learning algorithm will avoid the costs and complexity of universal screening, while yielding a similar case yield, as long as cholesterol testing is sufficiently common in children.  This study will identify the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population and the most influential data based on current knowledge and set the stage for efficiently designed clinical trials of FH screening. This study will be a test case for the concept of a “precision” population health approach to screening for genetically-determined diseases in the general population. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by lifetime elevated cholesterol, which, if uncontrolled, is associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conflicting current national guidelines highlight that the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population is controversial: it is unclear if screening should start in childhood or adulthood, or if it should include genetic testing. We propose to synthesize data from national surveys, high quality cohort studies, and clinical trials of cholesterol lowering interventions in a lifetime cardiovascular disease risk computer simulation model to project the life time health impact of different FH screening approaches and identify optimal screening strategies in children and adults.","Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches",9661259,R01HL141823,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coronary heart disease', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Decision Analysis', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Policy', 'Hepatocyte', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Low Prevalence', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proxy', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'economic evaluation', 'economic value', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'pediatric patients', 'population based', 'population health', 'premature', 'premature atherosclerosis', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,894544,-0.06064636919250241
"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9838988,R44AG059458,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applied Research', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fire - disasters', 'Floods', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Redwood', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'caregiver interventions', 'community setting', 'dementia caregiving', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'emotional behavior', 'flexibility', 'hazard', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'loved ones', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'social media', 'software systems', 'theories', 'user-friendly']",NIA,PEOPLE POWER COMPANY,R44,2019,1705298,-0.008985740036898325
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9567908,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'care outcomes', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2019,1747167,0.002783392570974395
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9674421,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2019,2193618,-0.04997221324951173
"Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet no large COPD study has ascertained cardiac function. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study was funded to test the endothelial hypothesis of emphysema and examine reduced RV dimensions (“cor pulmonale parvus”) in COPD. In the MESA COPD Study II, we found that associations of reduced pulmonary microvascular blood flow with emphysema do not appear to be confounded by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and that emphysema on CT predicted RV regression over 5 years. We also developed methods to further subtype emphysema and COPD and scaled them up to the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS). We used unsupervised machine learning to discover new emphysema subtypes that are common and have molecular origins. Separately, we found that 26% of adults have segmental airway variants, which are associated with COPD and the developmental genes FGF10 and RARA. Both genes affect right heart development. In pilot work, we found one dramatically altered RV strain and the other associated with cor pulmonale parvus. Finally, we found that bronchitic ‘symptomatic smokers,’ who have hyperinflation from gas trapping, may have increased LV diastolic dysfunction. Hence, cardiac alterations in COPD are complex but recent advances in COPD subtyping may allow their personalized diagnosis and treatment. SPIROMICS is an NHLBI-funded prospective study that recruited smokers with COPD and controls and is re-examining 2,000 participants with gold- standard lung phenotyping including full-lung CT. We propose to add comprehensive echocardiography (echo) with speckle-tracking for cardiac mechanics for 1,000 SPIROMICS participants, with exercise in 700 and cardiopulmonary MRI in 600, to test the following hypotheses: 1) machine-learned subtypes of emphysema on CT are associated with specific alterations in cardiac structure and function, which vary from cor pulmonale to LV diastolic dysfunction; 2) participants with segmental airway variants have abnormal RV structure and function; 3) symptomatic smokers have signs of increased LV afterload and LV diastolic dysfunction. Innovative aspects of the application include the use of novel echo and MRI measures in a large, well- characterized cohort of COPD patients. Confirmation of the hypotheses would define the mechanisms of HFpEF in COPD and identify subsets of patients for targeted treatment of cardiopulmonary dysfunction. The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction. The proposed study would be the first large study with gold-standard phenotyping of the heart and lungs and would test highly specific hypothesized based upon recent advances in lung subphenotyping to yield personalized approaches to combined cardiopulmonary disease in COPD.",Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF,9819260,R01HL093081,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DRD1 gene', 'Death Rate', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Drops', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Exercise', 'FGF10 gene', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypoxia', 'Impairment', 'Kinetics', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Pulmonary artery structure', 'RARA gene', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Right Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Sampling', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiogenesis', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'disorder subtype', 'genetic variant', 'heart function', 'heart preservation', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'receptor', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'unsupervised learning', 'vasoconstriction']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,2391491,-0.057656764842431464
"MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures Abstract: The ability to prioritize individuals for health care based on behavioral and acoustic patterns in speech will allow for efficient use of health care resources. The ability to predict mood states using daily monitoring of acoustics derived from mobile technology provides the basis for a real-time proxy measure of moods and affective states. Identification and monitoring of these and other dimensional features of human disease is the base for anticipating outcomes, offering the future possibility of timely and mitigating interventions. Technological and mHealth methods are well suited for the global health community due to the flexibility and adaptability of the approach; the capacity to reach large numbers of patients can be easily amplified with modest increase in infrastructure. We have developed an accurate prediction model for mood states in bipolar (BP) individuals using machine-learning strategies and established a process that involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and an integrated data analysis of clinical and acoustic data gathered from personal use of a mobile device for up to one year. The results show mood states are predicted with an AUC statistic of 0.74 (mania) and 0.77 (depression). We hypothesize that analyses across cultures will identify common features of illness that can be identified using our methods. BP is ideal for study because of the wide range of mood states and temperamental traits. This study aims to 1) ascertain 30 individuals with BP and 10 healthy controls from Lebanon and a multilingual community in SE Michigan, recording daily acoustic and behavioral data using a smart-phone, all outgoing speech from the device is gathered and all personal digital activity is recorded from the device. We propose to study participants in Lebanon and SE Michigan in order to identify the fundamental acoustic elements of mood variation among bipolar patients. 2) apply integrated computational analyses using static (Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling of categorical, dimensional and derived features from clinical, acoustic, and behavioral signals; we will compare data from the 15 BP from Lebanon and 15 BP from SE Michigan that have been resident in USA >2 years but originate from a geographical region comparable to Lebanon in language and culture, and 15 American born BP Caucasians (from our current cohort). Our hypothesis is that there are fundamental elements of acoustics that associate with mood states regardless of the culture. The impact is the longitudinal use of mobile technology to passively gather personal data to establish computational models that use extensive individual state and trait data to accurately predict mood and health states. This provides a foundation for predictive modeling that can be integrated into subsequent clinical interventional studies to predict and test causal effects of specific interventions on disease mechanisms. Expertise in clinical, computational, and technology disciplines form the team to realize these goals. This is a study that focuses on the ability of technological methods to detect speech and behavioral patterns in patients with bipolar disorder across cultural boundaries to identify common features that predict mood states. The overall goal is to use computational methods for the early detection of affect and mood changes that will provide the opportunity to monitor mood disorders using common methods regardless of cultural differences.",MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures,9566306,R21MH114835,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'American', 'Arabs', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Immigrant', 'Immigration', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lebanon', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multilingualism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data management', 'design', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'health data', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'markov model', 'mobile computing', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2018,30000,-0.08063091439078185
"Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients Failure to rescue (FTR), a nurse-sensitive national metric of health care quality, refers to death of a hospitalized patient from a treatable complication, and is potentiated by failure to recognize and appropriately respond to early signs of complications. There is a paucity of research examining patient features predictive of FTR complications. Such information could shift the current paradigm of nursing surveillance to earlier recognition, prevention and treatment of FTR complications, thereby saving lives. New-onset venous thromboembolism (VTE), an FTR complication occurring as either a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE), is the leading cause of preventable hospital death, carrying a high risk of mortality and a national cost burden of $7 billion annually. VTE is a complex disease process involving interactions between clinical risk factors and acquired and/or inherited susceptibilities to thrombosis. Although biomarkers and clinical factors associated with VTE have been identified, clinical manifestations are subtle, presenting gradually over hours to days. Current VTE risk assessment models (RAM), the cornerstone of prevention, have limited utility due to their complexity and lack of reliability, generalizability and external validation. A critical gap in VTE risk modeling research is that while new-onset VTE pathology evolves over the course of hospitalization, no current models incorporate the progressive accrual of dynamic patient data and pattern evolution over time in their modeling approaches. The totality of routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data is massive in terms of volume, variety, and production at a rapid velocity in real-time. Such big data could be used in machine learning (ML) analytic approaches to process time series clinical data to identify subtle, evolving feature patterns predictive of new-onset VTE and address this gap. This study proposes to assemble a large scale, multi-source, multi-dimensional VTE study dataset, and in tandem, systematically define the EHR data elements associated with a new-onset VTE diagnosis for computable phenotype algorithm development. We will then apply machine learning analytic approaches to baseline and accruing intensive time series clinical data in the curated dataset to develop models identifying data patterns and features predictive of dynamically evolving new-onset VTE in adult hospitalized patients. This proposal aligns with NINR’s strategic vision for nurse scientists to employ new strategies for collecting and analyzing complex big data sets to permit better understanding of the biological underpinnings of health, and improve ways nurses prevent and manage illness. This innovative study and individualized training plan under a strong and well- established team, represents initial steps in the applicant’s research trajectory focused on data science approaches to predict FTR complication risk, and develop, implement and test dynamic RAMs to inform targeted prevention and treatment decisions. Discovering new knowledge informing real-time decision making, nursing surveillance practices and care delivery systems can improve nurse sensitive patient outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of preventable hospital death. This study first proposes to develop a reproducible computable phenotype definition for new-onset VTE cohort ascertainment from the electronic health record, and then develop dynamic models for VTE risk assessment through the application of machine learning algorithms to massive electronic health record clinical data repositories. Such models can inform the mechanisms underlying this complex disease and identify subtle pattern changes in a patient’s condition forecasting a VTE event, enabling earlier nurse identification and intervention, and decreasing the development of complications and failure to rescue in hospitalized patients.",Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients,9610301,F31NR018102,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Quality of Care', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Vision', 'base', 'care delivery', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'prevent']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2018,44524,0.013661080347870379
"Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and other developed countries. About 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year. The incidence of stroke is expected to increase (due to diabetes, an aging population and a rise in obesity), which is a major public health concern and great economic burden to society. Early identification of people at risk of stroke is important as it allows for better planning and implementation of preventative strategies. A number of risk prediction models have been proposed for stroke using common biomarkers such as lipids, and conventional risk factors including age, gender, history of hypertension and smoking. However, these models do not adequately capture a substantial proportion of persons at high risk of stroke they lack precision (best accuracy is up to 50% by Framingham risk score) in risk estimation and have other limitations. Therefore, it is a necessity to improve the accuracy of a stroke risk prediction model. Therefore, we aim to develop a novel model using retinal vessel features and conventional risk factors which will provide higher accuracy on stroke prediction than the existing models and provide better preventative strategies for the people at risk of stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the risk of stroke. Hence, identification of patients at risk of incident stroke is critically needed to help prevent this life-threatening disease. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of stroke.",Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke,9753419,R43NS102100,"['Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'American', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Asians', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational Background', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologist', 'Obesity', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Width', 'aging population', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'early screening', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'platform-independent', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke risk', 'white matter']",NINDS,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R43,2018,45747,0.011741265620813127
"Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke Project Summary Stroke is a highly heterogeneous and complex disease and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification of the cause of disease is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but can be difficult, as up to 35% of causes are undetermined by traditional subtyping criteria and very few causative genetic variants have been found. In addition, certain causes may be hidden within the clinical picture of a patient, such as an adverse drug reaction. Using data-driven approaches to analyze the medical records of patients may uncover novel patterns of risk factors and clinical features leading to stroke. The long-term goal of this research is to identify novel subtypes of highly heterogeneous diseases such as stroke and to reduce the genetic heterogeneity of a disease cohort by identifying patients with the same subtype. The objective of this application is to propose a pipeline that applies a data-driven analysis of medical notes to identify novel subtypes of stroke, focus on a subtype caused by an adverse drug reaction or drug pair interaction, validate the subtype in a genotyped study cohort, and look for gene variant enrichment in this cohort. This application’s central hypothesis is that applying deep learning to the electronic health record (EHR) of acute ischemic stroke patients will form subtypes based on more granular information than currently implemented and with reduced genetic heterogeneity by identifying novel patterns of risk factors and clinical picture leading to the stroke. In addition, we hypothesize that at least one subtype will identify patients whose stroke is an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction. To do this, Aim 1 will first identify all acute ischemic stroke patients in the EHR by developing a machine learning classifier trained on structured data in the EHR. Aim 2 will then build and train an unsupervised deep learning algorithm on text from medical notes to identify clusters, or subtypes, of patients with similar clinical pictures. Aim 3 will finally validate reduction in genetic heterogeneity of these cohorts by estimating observational heritability of all subtypes using a tool created in our lab and comparing this with the heritability estimates of subtypes derived from physician-based criteria. It will also focus on a not well-studied subtype, stroke due to an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction, by identifying its enrichment in the novel subtypes, validating this subtype in a study cohort with genotyped data, and finally looking for enrichment of pharmacogenetic variants in this subtype. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that identifies novel subtypes of acute ischemic stroke, enabling improved future genetic studies by reducing genetic heterogeneity of cohorts and improved understanding of the underlying causes of the disease. Project Narrative Stroke is a highly complex disease that is a leading cause of death and severe disability. Identifying the cause of stroke is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but up to a third of cases are of undetermined cause, and very few genetic variants have been identified due to the heterogeneity of the disease. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational pipeline that applies data-driven deep learning to medical notes to identify novel combinations of environmental, genetic, and medical risk factors causing the disease; this tool may clarify the etiology of unknown stroke cases, provide cohorts of patients enriched with similar genetic variants, and be expanded to subtype any disease.",Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke,9469853,F30HL140946,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Internet', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'falls', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'population based', 'stroke patient', 'stroke recovery', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F30,2018,49524,-0.025593196864220496
"Detecting and Monitoring Tardive Dyskinesia to Improve Patient Outcomes Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a common debilitating side effect of antipsychotic use. Characterized most notably by involuntary facial movements such as grimacing, involuntary lip, mouth, and tongue movements, and eye blinking, TD is difficult to treat and potentially irreversible. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are acutely aware of the impairment and disability experienced by patients who develop TD. Early detection of TD is critical so that appropriate interventions can be instituted. Unfortunately, despite professionals’ best efforts, it is often too late in the process and the involuntary movements are permanent. Antipsychotic prescriptions exceeded 50 million in 2011 and the reported incidence of TD is between 13% and 24%. Risk grows with advancing age, off-label uses, and chronic exposure to antipsychotics. Therefore, prevention and early detection are key to managing TD. However, current methods for monitoring patients require observation of patients at infrequent in-person visits or self-reporting by vigilant patients and their families. Therefore strong market potential exists for an automated detection system. This Phase I project proposes to leverage existing telepsychiatry and video interview data gathering technologies available commercially to efficiently collect and analyze one hundred ten (110) 5-minute video interviews with individuals taking anti-psychotic medications. Half of the interviews will be with individuals living with diagnosed TD and the other without a diagnosis of TD. The participants in the study will be recruited to ensure an equal distribution of females and males as well as an ethnically and racially representative sample. The proposed data gathering strategy will provide the source material necessary to create a powerful supervised machine learning derived video and audio analysis tool to detect TD. The detection tool will be created using 80% of the collected video data as a training set and validated on the remaining 20% reserved as the control set. Based on industry experience with other supervised machine learning training sets and the amount of data to be collected, we set a goal of a 90% success rate in identifying TD positive and TD negative participants in the control set. Once the detection tool is complete the project will conclude by incorporating access to the tool into an existing smartphone app, iRxReminder, that is used for data gathering and monitoring of medication adherence. The iRxReminder system links patients directly to researchers’ and healthcare professionals’ electronic records. The modified app will be tested in the laboratory to ensure the interface can be easily used. The addendum request includes additional funding to participate in the I-Corp training. Participants in the training will include CEO and PI/PD Anthony Sterns PhD, C-level executive Fred Pollock serving as iRxReminder’s CBO, and Industry Expert Fred Ma, MD PhD, who serves as iRxReminder’s regulatory consultant. In Phase II the iRxReminder system will be validated for use in supporting the self-management and symptom monitoring of medication taking by individuals living with chronic mental illnesses. Once feasibility is established, we propose a year-long RCT where participants will be monitored for early detection of TD along with goals for high adherence, improved control of symptoms and side effects, and more aggressive and frequent treatment responses by the healthcare team. A recent study reported that TD rates among newly treated elderly ranged from 7.2% for those taking Risperidone to 11.1% for those taking olanzapine after 2 years of treatment. Earlier meta-analyses estimate TD frequency in women to be 26.6% and in men 21.6%. Ethnically Chinese and Malaysian mental health patients were studied in Singapore and patients taking anti-psychotic medications were found to have TD in 40% and 29% of cases respectively. Regardless of prevalence, TD is a threat to patient adherence and quality of life. TD only remits in a minority of cases and can be permanent. With 50 million prescriptions for anti-psychotics written annually, more than 10 million persons living with a chronic mental illness are at risk of developing TD. There are likely over 6 million patients living with TD and the number of patients with TD is expected to grow with the aging population and increasing off- label use of antipsychotics.!",Detecting and Monitoring Tardive Dyskinesia to Improve Patient Outcomes,9660614,R43MH114763,"['Acute', 'Addendum', 'Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Awareness', 'Blinking', 'Chinese People', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Involuntary Movements', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaysian', 'Medical Care Team', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychiatrist', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risperidone', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Singapore', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tardive Dyskinesia', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'aging population', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'disability', 'experience', 'improved', 'male', 'medication compliance', 'men', 'olanzapine', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'severe mental illness', 'smartphone Application', 'success', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"CREATIVE ACTION, LLC",R43,2018,50000,0.013725402797831344
"A software tool for objective identification of concussion-related vision disorders using a novel eye-tracking device ABSTRACT This project will create the first objective measurement tool, the VisBox, for the vision subtype of concussion (VSC). This will enable physicians to identify VSC without an eye-care professional, for referral to a vision specialist for personalized vision therapy recommendations. The persistence of concussion symptoms beyond several weeks is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, and children are particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties. A lack of accessible, objective vision diagnostics are critical barriers to identification of VSC and referral for treatment. The VisBox will be a software product that is used with the OcuTracker, Oculogica’s proprietary eye-tracking hardware platform. The VisBox will input eye movement measurements from the OcuTracker, calculate metrics that correspond to aspects of cranial nerve function affected during a concussion, and use those metrics to calculate a score to predict VSC using an algorithm developed with guided machine learning in the course of this study. The VisBox will be used by non- vision specialists to objectively measure three vision disorders related to concussion: convergence insufficiency (CI), accommodative insufficiency (AI), and saccadic dysfunction (SD) in under 4 minutes, during the clinical visit where the concussion is diagnosed. The long-term goal is to develop an objective assessment of vision characteristics, that will enable physicians that are non-specialists in vision to 1) screen for concussion-related vision disorders; 2) identify VSC; 3) make decisions about the necessity of a referral for a comprehensive vision examination; 4) monitor the effectiveness of vision treatment. Phase I Hypothesis. VisBox can produce an output score that correlates with the presence or absence of TBI- related vision disorder, i.e., VSC, by leveraging the OcuTracker visual stimulus and eye tracking system. Specific Aim I. Generate OcuTracker eye tracking data and the diagnosis of TBI-related vision disorder in 250 pediatric concussion patients. Specific Aim II. Develop and validate VisBox algorithm for assessing CI, AI, and SD using OcuTracker data. Plans for Phase II. The VisBox score will be used to predict responsiveness to vision therapy in a prospective randomized clinical study. Phase II will be a multi-armed study comparing vision therapy with placebo therapy in concussion patients and assessing whether the VisBox software can predict which patients are responsive to vision therapy. Commercial Opportunity. VisBox customers are non-eye care specialists including neurologists, pediatricians, emergency room physicians, sports medicine physicians, and concussion specialists. The total addressable market is $400M, assuming 4M annual scans at $100/scan needed for concussions in the US. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT At least 4 million concussions occur in the US each year, and up to 30% of these injuries persist beyond 4 weeks in a condition known as persistent post-concussion symptoms, which is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, with children particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties – with often serious consequences. The lack of an accessible, objective vision diagnostics presents a critical barrier to identification of the vision disorder concussion sub-type (VSC) and referral for treatment. The proposed technology will be the first objective tool that can be used by non-vision-specialists to identify concussion-related vision symptoms that is accessible to a broad range of facilities and will enable non-specialist physicians the ability to refer patients to concussion specialists to improve outcomes, decrease the time it takes patients to return to work or play, and reduce healthcare costs associated with this debilitating condition.",A software tool for objective identification of concussion-related vision disorders using a novel eye-tracking device,9698505,R41NS103698,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Brain Concussion', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Convergence Insufficiency', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Fees', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Monitor', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Optometrist', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Post-Concussion Syndrome', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vision', 'Vision Disorders', 'Visit', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'chronic pain', 'commercial application', 'concussive symptom', 'disabling symptom', 'disorder subtype', 'economic impact', 'handheld equipment', 'improved outcome', 'lens', 'novel', 'patient response', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'tv watching', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,"OCULOGICA, INC.",R41,2018,50000,-0.022819817092316567
"Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and other developed countries. About 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year. The incidence of stroke is expected to increase (due to diabetes, an aging population and a rise in obesity), which is a major public health concern and great economic burden to society. Early identification of people at risk of stroke is important as it allows for better planning and implementation of preventative strategies. A number of risk prediction models have been proposed for stroke using common biomarkers such as lipids, and conventional risk factors including age, gender, history of hypertension and smoking. However, these models do not adequately capture a substantial proportion of persons at high risk of stroke they lack precision (best accuracy is up to 50% by Framingham risk score) in risk estimation and have other limitations. Therefore, it is a necessity to improve the accuracy of a stroke risk prediction model. Therefore, we aim to develop a novel model using retinal vessel features and conventional risk factors which will provide higher accuracy on stroke prediction than the existing models and provide better preventative strategies for the people at risk of stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the risk of stroke. Hence, identification of patients at risk of incident stroke is critically needed to help prevent this life-threatening disease. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of stroke.",Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke,9658923,R43NS102100,"['Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'American', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Asians', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational Background', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologist', 'Obesity', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Width', 'aging population', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'early screening', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'platform-independent', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke risk', 'white matter']",NINDS,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R43,2018,50000,0.011741265620813127
"Prediction of short-term risk of coronary heart disease and overall risk of ischemic cardiomyopathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the United States, although mortality from CHD has declined over recent decades, the incidence of CHD has remained high. This year, nearly 600,000 Americans will experience their first myocardial infarction (MI) and a larger number will have undiagnosed ischemia. Both groups are at risk of developing ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), which compounds the burden of morbidity and mortality they face. Efforts to prevent CHD and its complications like ICM have been hampered by poor patient adherence, which is in large part due to misperceptions of risk. Patients are more likely to engage in preventive behaviors if they know their risk of disease, particularly if their risk is imminent. However, although several models estimate long-term risk of CHD over the next 10 years, there are no established models for predicting short-term risk of CHD within a one year time frame. Likewise, among patients with CHD, there are no existing models to assess the overall risk of coexisting ICM. To address these knowledge gaps in the field, I will build robust prediction models by applying the latest machine learning algorithms to the recently available large datasets comprising the UK Biobank and the Veterans Affairs (VA) cohorts.  In Aim 1, I will examine the 477,000 UK Biobank participants without preexisting CHD to develop a prediction model for one-year risk of new onset CHD. I will use several different machine learning algorithms, compare their respective predictive performances, and select the best-performing and most clinically applicable model. I will also compare the risk classification ability of this new model with existing long-term risk prediction models such as the Framingham and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) risk scores.  In Aim 2, I will apply machine learning techniques to a large VA patient cohort consisting of over 300,000 patients with known coronary anatomy and left ventricular systolic function to develop a prediction model for the presence of ICM. In light of the two primary mechanisms for ischemic cardiomyopathy, irreversible myocyte loss from MI and hibernating myocardium from chronic ischemia, I will perform a stratified analysis by history of prior MI to determine if the risk factors for ICM vary depending on whether the pathological mechanism is infarction versus ischemia.  An improved understanding of the predictors of CHD and ICM will lead to insights into the biological basis of ischemic heart disease. Moreover, accurate identification of individuals who are at imminent risk for CHD and its complication, ICM, is of central importance to efforts in preventing cardiovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary heart disease and its complications such as ischemic cardiomyopathy are the global leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and an improved ability to assess risk along this continuum of ischemic heart disease is urgently needed. I will apply the latest machine learning techniques to the recently available large datasets comprising the UK Biobank and VA cohorts to develop robust prediction models for short-term risk of coronary heart disease and overall risk of ischemic cardiomyopathy.

"Variation in Surgeon-Level Intraoperative Costs: An Intervention Study Project Summary The growth of national health care expenditures is unsustainable, reaching a staggering $2.9 trillion in 2013 (8). Surgical expenditures are estimated to account for 29% of costs and consume 1/14th of our nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025 (2, 3). Time in the operating room is extremely costly, with estimates as high as $100 per minute(4). Surgical supplies alone represent up to 50% of operating room expenses(14). Historically, there has been little incentive to contain costs, but with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), reimbursements are now linked to a diagnosis or a procedure, rather than individual components of a patient's care(10). This shifts the burden of reducing expenses to health care providers who must now deliver high quality care on a fixed income. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), in particular, has an interest in evaluating, optimizing, and delivering valuable healthcare under this new framework. Surgeons have a direct impact on the cost of a patient's care as they pre-select items used for cases and open additional instruments as the operation progresses. It is common for a single surgical implant to cost thousands of dollars. Despite this, research describing intraoperative expenses is rare (16). This proposal seeks to remedy this information gap by (I) calculating surgeon-specific intraoperative costs for common general surgery operations across several academic hospitals, (II) identifying factors that drive these expenses, and (III) developing and implementing an intervention aimed to reduce these expenses. This project will retrospectively analyze electronic medical record (EMR) and hospital accounting data to determine average surgeon-expenditures for several common operations across multiple institutions. Multiple logistic regression analysis will identify the impact of patient and surgeon factors on costs. Semi-structured interviews of focus groups will shape development of the intervention. This will be followed by a six-month implementation phase and prospective analysis of the intervention's efficacy and feasibility. Results of this study will inform hospitals and health care systems about the relative costs of items used in their operating rooms and the factors driving these expenses. Importantly, it will introduce a methodology for institutions to analyze their own expenses and provide a generalizable, structured intervention that can be adapted for their use. Project Narrative There is growing pressure nationally, including from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), for critical assessments of the value provided by healthcare organizations. This proposal seeks to understand the costs of providing surgical care, specifically, the costs of surgical supplies for general surgery operations, which reflect a large but mutable component of expenditures. Further, this proposal seeks to introduce and evaluate a prospective intervention to reduce these expenses, the results of which will inform hospitals and providers about mechanisms they can use to reduce costs.",Variation in Surgeon-Level Intraoperative Costs: An Intervention Study,9552119,F32HS025079,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F32,2018,71073,0.01911110460599166
"Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes Project Summary/Abstract The Hispanic population in the U.S. aged 65 and older has been growing rapidly and is projected to increase 5- fold between 2012 and 2050, when Hispanics are expected to make up more than 18% of the older adult population. Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. Disease diagnosis is often the basis for estimating prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in the population. People of Hispanic origin, however, are at greater risk of under diagnosis because of the unique challenges they face accessing and interacting with the health care system. The main objectives of the proposed project are two-fold: 1) to obtain estimates of hypertension and diabetes prevalence for different Hispanic subpopulations, defined by ethnic origin, nativity, and time in the U.S.; and 2) to determine how sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment interact to influence risk for hypertension and diabetes. Data for this project come from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which includes a large diverse sample of Hispanics, information on both disease diagnosis and direct assessments of disease risk, and contextual data on the social, economic, and health care environment. Multilevel modeling and logistic regression models will be used to: 1) examine the association between sociocultural factors and reported and measured disease prevalence; 2) determine if variation in health insurance and health care utilization accounts for Hispanic group differences in hypertension and diabetes; and 3) determine if variation in the sociomedical environment account for Hispanic differences in hypertension and diabetes. Results from the proposed project will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities. Project Narrative Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. This study will integrate multilevel information on sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment to advance understanding of the risks for developing hypertension and diabetes among older Hispanic populations. Results from the study will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities, and will inform interventions targeted at addressing disease burden to improve quality of life among Hispanics.",Reconociendo Las Raices (Recognizing the Roots): Hispanic Ethnic Heterogeneity in Reported and Measured Hypertension and Diabetes,9436167,R36AG057949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Face', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Physical environment', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Puerto Rican', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'age related', 'burden of illness', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'segregation', 'social', 'social disparities', 'socioeconomic disadvantage']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R36,2018,72343,0.00289744649795699
"The Effectiveness of an Early Childhood Home Visiting Program to Reduce Child Maltreatment Project Summary We propose to examine the effectiveness of an early childhood home visiting program to reduce child maltreatment after dissemination to at-risk mothers in Connecticut, through analysis of administrative data. Child maltreatment has life-long impacts on children and is difficult to prevent, but there is evidence that home visiting can reduce maltreatment in the research setting. The effectiveness of home visiting in decreasing child maltreatment after dissemination to community settings is not well established. One challenge in evaluating maltreatment accurately is surveillance bias, which is the increased chance of a report that a family in the home visiting program has, compared to if they were not in the program. These extra reports are hypothesized to be for less severe situations. One way to assess maltreatment that avoids surveillance bias is to examine medical care for injuries, which can be considered a proxy measure for child maltreatment. Although many injuries are accidental, if one group has more injuries than another, this may be evidence that they either have a less safe environment (potential neglect) or have been physically abused. In Connecticut, approximately 40% of first-time mothers are screened for maltreatment risk each year for a voluntary home visiting program; this screening takes place in birth hospitals, through referrals from prenatal care providers, and other social services. Home visits take place for up to 5 years. We propose to examine child maltreatment by comparing families in the program to demographically-similar families who were not in the program. We will create a comparison group using birth certificate data from children born during the same time period, but not in the program for a variety of reasons (including program availability and not being screened). We utilized propensity score matching to identify similar families using demographic and health behavior data available from the birth certificates (such as neighborhood characteristics, adequate prenatal care, and maternal age). We have a sample of 4,886 program families and 23,904 comparison families. We will link these groups to both Child Protective Services (CPS) data and Medicaid/CHIP data to create 2 separate datasets. Using logistic regression and survival analysis with CPS data, we will compare investigated and substantiated reports; child removals from the home; and timing and severity of reports. Surveillance bias will be estimated using the difference-in-differences approach. Using logistic regression and the Medicaid/CHIP data, we will determine if injuries and injury-related hospitalizations are decreased in the program group. This project would lead to a better understanding of how to evaluate maltreatment in the context of home visiting. Project Relevance One goal of home visiting programs for new mothers is to reduce child abuse and neglect, a serious public health problem with life-long impacts on children. Although home visiting research trials have produced evidence for reductions in maltreatment, this evidence was mixed and few studies have examined these outcomes in community-replication sites. This project will examine the impact of a statewide home visiting program on child maltreatment, measured both by Child Protective Services determinations and by health care utilization for injuries.",The Effectiveness of an Early Childhood Home Visiting Program to Reduce Child Maltreatment,9583736,R03HD096114,"['Accidental Injury', 'Age', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Health', 'Communities', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maternal Age', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Policy Maker', 'Prenatal care', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Selection Bias', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Work', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'base', 'care providers', 'child protective service', 'community setting', 'comparison group', 'early childhood', 'health care service utilization', 'human subject', 'maltreatment', 'neglect', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'social']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2018,83750,-0.01775800375232965
"Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry. Project Summary Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care are national priorities. There is growing evidence that such disparities extend to the care of children. Our overall goals are to Detect, Understand, and Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the emergency care of children. Through this proposal we will have the capacity to utilize the AHRQ funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry, a comprehensive clinical registry of all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits from 7 EDs to detect racial and ethnic disparities in the management of children seeking care in the ED. Once we detect the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in health care provision, we can then seek to understand why such disparities exist, which can then inform interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity. Through rigorous evaluation and use of multicenter comprehensive clinical data, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of pediatric emergency care. Project Narrative Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of health services is a national priority. Since the emergency department (ED) is universally available for all children to access care, it is critically important to determine whether pediatric care in EDs is being delivered equitably. With this proposal, we intend to utilize the PECARN Registry, a large registry that contains comprehensive clinical data from all pediatric ED visits made to 7 EDs, to detect whether racial and ethnic disparities exist in health care delivery for children seeking care in the ED. This proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to achieve health equity in the provision of pediatric emergency care.",Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry.,9543554,R03MD011654,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Academy', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'Adult', 'American', 'Analgesics', 'Appendicitis', 'Applied Research', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'care outcomes', 'care seeking', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'discrete data', 'ethnic difference', 'health care delivery', 'health care disparity', 'health disparity', 'health equity', 'inclusion criteria', 'long bone', 'pain reduction', 'pain score', 'pediatric emergency', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial difference', 'response']",NIMHD,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2018,90974,-0.033195272835030785
"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,9355893,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable device']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2018,92000,-0.0075189414607602445
"EMTALA Enforcement: An evaluation of hospital characteristics associated with citation, and hospital response to citation Project Summary The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) is one of the most important pieces of federal legislation governing emergency care. EMTALA was passed in 1986 in response to highly publicized incidents of inadequate, delayed or denied treatment of uninsured patients by emergency departments (EDs). The intent of EMTALA was to prevent EDs from practicing patient “dumping,” defined as turning away or transferring patients without authorization or initiation of appropriate stabilizing measures based on their ability to pay. EMTALA requires that all ED patients receive a timely medical screening evaluation, stabilization of identified emergent conditions, and, when indicated, transfer to another facility for higher level of care. EMTALA is an actively enforced law. EMTALA empowers the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to authorize EMTALA investigations and grants substantial punitive powers. Since 2005, 43% of U.S. hospitals have been investigated and 27% cited for EMTALA violation. There is 5-fold variation in rates of EMTALA citations across CMS regions. It is unknown whether this variation reflects arbitrary differences in reporting, investigation and enforcement of alleged violations, or true differences in quality of care. Little is known about characteristics of hospitals cited for EMTALA violations or how facility response to citation impacts access to care for patients served by the institution. To evaluate whether EMTALA enforcement serves as a viable tool to reduce health disparities and promote quality we propose to (1) create a longitudinal dataset of EMTALA citations 2005-2016 linked to hospital characteristics and quality of care measures, (2) use multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the associations between facility-level features (e.g., payer mix, hospital quality, ED volume, urban/rural status) and citation for an EMTALA violation, and (3) survey hospital administrators to explore facility response to EMTALA citations. We will conduct an exploratory survey of administrators at California hospitals with recent EMTALA citations (2014-2016, n=96) to characterize and describe operational changes following citations. We expect facilities to respond to EMTALA citations with a variety of measures including modification of on-call specialist coverage, overhauling policies and procedures, educating providers, auditing procedural compliance, and instituting other important but resource intensive measures including hiring additional ED providers, opening beds, or upgrading facilities. Understanding whether EMTALA citations disproportionately impact facilities with poor quality, or hospitals serving vulnerable populations, and how facilities respond to EMTALA citation will improve understanding of how EMTALA impacts access to emergency care for vulnerable populations. EDs are an essential part of the U.S. safety-net, and the provider of last resort for millions of underserved low-income and minority patients, making this issue of particular importance to the AHRQ priority populations. Project Narrative The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) is the most important federal legislation governing emergency care, as EMTALA citations can result in CMS provider agreement termination and lead to hospital closure. Currently there are no published studies examining predictors of EMTALA citation or how facilities respond to citation. Understanding whether EMTALA enforcement disproportionately impacts facilities with poor quality, or hospitals serving vulnerable populations, and how facilities respond to EMTALA citations will help to elucidate whether EMTALA enforcement serves as a viable tool to reduce health disparities and promote quality.","EMTALA Enforcement: An evaluation of hospital characteristics associated with citation, and hospital response to citation",9530337,R03HS025281,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R03,2018,100000,0.020681207407058772
"Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures,9505794,K99MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive signature', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2018,128072,-0.015979898572939785
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9526512,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2018,129737,-0.0008071317812433588
"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9504868,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2018,131517,0.010885300190838927
"Schizophrenia Comorbidities: Common Genes and Clusters The vastly reduced life expectancy in schizophrenia is primarily due to medical comorbidities, yet these are often overlooked in a research context. Numerous psychiatric and somatic diagnoses have increased rates in schizophrenia, and the majority of schizophrenia patients have comorbid conditions. Since lifestyle factors and medication side-effects likely contribute to many of these increased medical problems, it has been difficult to resolve the extent to which shared biological underpinnings contribute to comorbid conditions. The aims for this proposal will be accomplished using data from the Genomic Aggregation Project in Sweden (GAPS) with >200k genotyped subjects and comprehensive medical and demographic information from the Swedish National Registers. This wealth of information allows for additional clinical risk from schizophrenia-associated variants to be captured. In Aim 1, carriers of previously identified schizophrenia risk variants without this diagnosis will be studied for increased risk of diagnoses across multiple psychiatric and somatic domains compared to non-carriers using logistic regression. Furthermore, comorbidities may offer clues to the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to different forms of schizophrenia. With this in mind, comorbid conditions will be leveraged to define schizophrenia subtypes in Aim 2 using the >5000 cases in the Swedish Schizophrenia Study within GAPS. Following cluster analysis using comorbidities, validity will be assessed by testing for group differences in genetic and clinical variation. These studies will yield new insights into the relationships between schizophrenia and other medical conditions, and identify subtypes of schizophrenia that will facilitate personalized medical care. Comorbidities are a fundamental feature of schizophrenia and may arise due to shared biological foundations, deleterious lifestyle factors or combinations of these influences. This study explores the origins of these comorbidities by studying the extent to which genetic risk for schizophrenia in unaffected individuals impacts risk for other psychiatric or somatic diagnoses. Furthermore, in a population with schizophrenia, patterns of comorbidity will be leveraged to identify subtypes with etiological and clinical significance.",Schizophrenia Comorbidities: Common Genes and Clusters,9506887,R21MH116188,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Carriers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Mind', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sweden', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'clinical care', 'clinical risk', 'clinically significant', 'cost effective', 'disorder subtype', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'pleiotropism', 'risk variant', 'societal costs']",NIMH,KAROLINSKA INSTITUTE,R21,2018,135778,-0.022402342766052425
"Characterizing Prehospital Delay and Outcomes in Patients Treated for Potential Acute Coronary Syndrome in the Emergency Department Delayed treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) can be a matter of life or death. Each 30-minute increase in treatment delay raises the one-year mortality rate by 7.5%. The median patient prehospital delay time in presentation to the emergency department (ED) is more than two hours and has ranged from 1-24 hours, raising the risk of one year mortality up to an astounding 360% across studies. Emergent reperfusion targets (<90 minutes) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have been largely met with no resultant decrease in mortality suggesting that prehospital, rather than in-hospital delay, is contributing to poorer patient outcomes. In addition, ACS is associated with multiple debilitating symptoms, impaired functional status, repeat visits to the ED, and frequent healthcare utilization but inadequate attention has been paid to the relationship between prehospital delay (defined as time of symptom onset to arrival in the ED) and these patient outcomes. The objective of this secondary data analysis is to identify multiple, theory-based factors associated with prehospital delay and examine the association of prehospital delay with the outcomes of healthcare utilization and persistent symptoms. The sample includes patients presenting to the ED with symptoms that triggered an evaluation for possible ACS. Data from the prospective Think Symptoms study, whose main aim was to characterize the influence of gender on symptoms during ACS, will be used for analyses. The dataset includes a multiethnic sample of 1064 patients (400 women and 664 men) presenting to the ED with symptoms that triggered a cardiac evaluation. Data were collected in four academic and one non- academic medical center in four regions of the US. The dataset is unique in that it includes patients ruled-in for ACS and ruled-out for ACS as well as symptom data collected at presentation to triage, in the ED examination room, and one and six months following discharge. Specific aims of this study are to: 1) Identify predictors of prehospital delay for potential ACS by final diagnosis (ACS vs. no ACS) including patient factors, event factors, and transportation factors; 2) Determine the association between prehospital delay and one and six-month health care utilization and symptom outcomes by diagnosis (ACS vs. no ACS); and 3) Determine the relative contribution of patient, event, and transportation factors on patient outcomes attributable to prehospital delay. Multilinear and logistic regression modeling adjusting for relevant covariates will be used to address aims 1 and 2. Path analyses, a form of statistical equation modeling will be used to address aim 3. This novel work will provide models of patient factors influencing delay that will fill knowledge gaps and aid in the design of patient-centered interventions to reduce prehospital delay for ACS and improve patient outcomes. The outcome of this novel secondary analyses of data from the Think Symptoms study will be to advance science by providing data on the relationships between factors influencing prehospital delay and the potential impact on post-discharge patient outcomes.

"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs.

"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes. This proposal will provide mentored research training to use predictive modeling to improve early diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, and test the delivery of clinical decision support to clinicians through the electronic health record in an implementation trial.

"Objective Evaluation of Variation in Sepsis Incidence, Mortality, and Care PROJECT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a leading cause of death, disability, and cost to the healthcare system. Increasing recognition of the devastating burden of sepsis has prompted national performance improvement initiatives and efforts to benchmark the quality of sepsis care. However, efforts to track sepsis incidence, outcomes, and quality have been hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance tools. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has thus led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records (EHRs) using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction. He has demonstrated that this method is less susceptible to changing diagnosis and coding practices over time than administrative claims data, the traditional method of surveillance, and can be applied to diverse EHR systems in different healthcare systems. The overall goal of this proposal is to build on this work to improve the ability of researchers, clinical organizations, and policy makers to evaluate variation in sepsis incidence, outcomes, and care and thus identify targets for improvement and inform better prevention and treatment strategies. These themes fit with AHRQ's mission to improve health care quality and patient safety, and are reflected in the Specific Aims: 1) Develop and validate a disease severity prediction model for risk-adjustment of sepsis outcomes based on data routinely captured in electronic health records, 2) Evaluate interhospital and intrahospital unit-level variation in sepsis incidence and outcomes using objective EHR-data versus claims codes and identify factors associated with worse outcomes, and 3) Evaluate the impact of lactate testing on clinical outcomes in patients with suspected sepsis. This project will leverage “big data” with granular clinical information from more than 200 academic and community hospitals and 4 million inpatient encounters, providing the capacity to adjust for multiple confounders, analyze important patient subgroups, and make robust conclusions that are widely generalizable to the nation. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, MD, MPH, is a junior faculty member in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a dual-certified critical care and infectious disease physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital. This K08 proposal will capitalize on Dr. Rhee's rich clinical background, foundational training in epidemiology, biostatistics, and public health, and previous research experience with sepsis epidemiology and surveillance using EHR clinical data. Dr. Rhee's immediate goals during this award period are to 1) acquire skills in using “big data” in healthcare and handling missing data, 2) learn advanced methods in prediction modeling and mixed-effects logistic regression, 3) learn propensity score analysis and comparative effectiveness research skills, 4) improve communication, research leadership, and grant writing skills, and 5) participate in ongoing training in ethical research conduct. These goals will be accomplished through a combination of active mentoring; formal didactic coursework; immersive research training; practical experience; and collaborations with internationally recognized sepsis and infectious disease experts, public health officials, and the Hospital Corporation of America, the largest inpatient private healthcare system in the world. Throughout the K08 award period, he will continue to establish himself as a national thought leader on sepsis epidemiology, surveillance, and quality while preparing for his transition to independence. Dr. Rhee's multidisciplinary and experienced mentorship team, combined with the superb research environment of the Harvard Medical School Department of Population Medicine, provides the support and training experience necessary to achieve his long-term goal of becoming an independently funded health services researcher focusing on using big data to improve disease surveillance, prevention, and quality of care for sepsis and infections in critically ill patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE   The devastating burden of sepsis on our society has prompted national performance improvement initiatives, but efforts to measure sepsis rates, outcomes, and quality of care are hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance methods.  The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction rather than administrative claims codes, which are prone to variability in diagnosis and coding practices and changing billing incentives over time.

"Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare Project Summary With newly available electronic health data and a massive increase in processing power, data-driven personalized medicine is just now becoming possible.1 However, advances to improve health care are inherently limited by data quality. One of the most used sources of data, the patient problem list, is also the greatest source of data inaccuracy. According to recent studies, the patient problem list is often less than 50% accurate in documenting the most critical conditions.2 3 4 5 These errors exacerbate inefficiencies throughout the American health care system from care delivery to quality improvement. Primary care physicians rely on problem lists to develop transitional treatment plans for the 68 million Americans who change providers every year. Errors related to care transitions harm more than 1.5 million people each year in the United States, costing the nation an estimated $3.5 billion annually.6 Population health efforts, a cornerstone of value-based healthcare, rely on problem lists to determine risk levels and deployment of resources. These efforts cannot succeed if the source data produce faulty results. This application seeks to enable better individual patient care, enhanced population health management, and effective downstream analytics by building an automated problem list builder, which provides an accurate and granular account of the patient’s medical conditions. If the program is successful, one of the greatest technical risks in value-based healthcare will be addressed. Phase I exceeded success criteria in proving feasibility of core modules in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence. Based on Phase I success, implementation pathways are demonstrated through pilots with one of the largest US healthcare systems and one of the largest global biotechnology firms. The team is comprised of commercial and academic leaders in the field of NLP-based products applied to value-based healthcare. Project Narrative VMT proposes to use advanced semantic technologies and artificial intelligence to enhance the individualized patient problem list, which frequently has 50% or lower accuracy for common conditions such as cancer, smoking, and heart failure. 1 2 3 The problem list represents source data in care delivery, population health, shared-risk contracting, and research.

"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9559625,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2018,156568,0.014082200190296839
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy.

"Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place SUMMARY This proposal is for an NLM sponsored K01 Mentored Career Development Award. The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention.

This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance Statement: Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting over 550,000 patients each year, with a 45–60% mortality rate at 5 years. Despite advances in treatment, little progress has been made to improve heart failure diagnosis, and thus patients in early heart failure stages do not receive appropriate life-extending therapies. Through robust data science methodologies, this study harnesses critically underutilized, high-fidelity data available during the perioperative period to improve diagnosis of heart failure .",Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach,9504767,K01HL141701,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Blood Pressure', 'Board Certification', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'International', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2018,172141,0.005124359876461992
"Algorithms to Identify Systemic Lupus from Electronic Health Record Data Abstract  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, multisystem disease that is often difficult to diagnose because of the diverse manifestations that occur over time and across care sites leading to increased damage and early mortality. The personal and economic costs in decreased quality of life and increase in healthcare expenditures, respectively, highlight the critical unmet need to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat lupus, so that treatment or participation in clinical trials occurs as early as possible to mitigate against disease-related damage. Therefore, it is important to find better ways to identify SLE patents.  Electronic health records (EHR) are now used in a majority of health care settings throughout the country, and present a rich source of information about patients which can be mined for earlier diagnosis and identification to improve quality of care, or enable high throughput clinical studies. Despite this potential, to date few accurate algorithms have been developed to identify SLE patients using EHR data. Construction of an effective algorithm, either by rule-based or machine learning methods, requires access to at two data resources not commonly available: 1) a validated “gold standard” patient data set with clear documentation of criteria that are indicative of SLE that can be compared against EHR data and 2) an integrated health record dataset that contains data from multiple health care institutions and reflects that SLE patients receive healthcare at multiple institutions and healthcare providers given their chronic, progressive disease. Over the past several years, our team has created both key resources: the Chicago Lupus Database (CLD), a physician-validated registry of 880 patients and gold standard data set and the Chicago HealthLNK Data Repository (HDR), a regional data resource including integrated medical records for 2.1 million patients across multiple institutions. Jointly, these two datasets enable the creation, testing and validation of algorithms for the identification of SLE in EHR data and provide a more complete picture of a patient population at risk for lupus.  We propose three specific aims to address the need to reduce the time to identify those with SLE in order to initiate treatment in a timelier fashion and to identify candidates for clinical trials. These aims are: 1) To create and validate a series of algorithms to identify SLE patients in EHR data against a gold standard curated registry, CLD, using validated classification criteria for SLE to build concepts for rule-based and machine learning methods that incorporate structured data, laboratory data, and unstructured data, e.g., physician notes, 2) To determine whether identification of SLE patients is improved when algorithms to identify SLE patients are extended to an integrated medical record dataset that includes data from multiple health care institutions, and 3) To use clustering techniques on SLE patients identified from EHR data to isolate clinically distinct sub-populations of patients, which could inform patient selection for participation in clinical trials.

"Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings Project Summary (Abstract) With little change in incidence for over 50 years, pneumonia remains the top cause for morbid hospitalization1 in the USA, and is associated with healthcare costs exceeding $10 billion annually2. This study proposes to mine big data captured in an intergrated medical/dental record (iEHR) and enterprise data warehouse (EDW) of a large midwestern medical-dental integrated healthcare system and will test the hypothesis that poor oral health is an independent risk for subtypes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Proposed specific aims include: 1) electronic identification and characterization of pneumonia types and 2) evaluation of the association of oral health status with risk of pneumonia. Tasks to achieve study aims are to: a) develop electronic, phenotype-based algorithm(s) to classify and characterize pneumonia by subtype and relative frequency of events; b) characterize impact of immediate and longitudinal oral health status on emergent pneumonia stratified by subtype; and c) evaluate relative risk contributed by medical and dental factors. Innovative application of natural language processing (NLP) to support evaluation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML) to identify as-yet unknown potential risk factors is proposed. These aims will be accomplished by established investigators including dentists and researchers with extensive research track records in oral and systemic health including pneumonia, clinical pulmonologist/intensivist to provide clinical expertise to inform data mining, biomedical informaticians with expertise in data mining, ML and NLP and data modeling, and experienced biostatisticians who will apply appropriate statistical approaches and traditional data modeling to big data. This team will collaboratively create and deliver a unique, well-defined, pneumonia- specific, oral health data registry resource and validated phenotype-based algorithm to classify pneumonia, stratified by subtypes, which will support future interrogation for additional permutations of medical and dental factors. Study outcomes are expected to leverage immediate translational value within the health system with high potential for relevance and portability to other settings. The project is expected to define risk factors which may represent actionable targets for reduction of pneumonia risk across various settings. Project Narrative- Relevance to public health: Pneumonia continues as a leading public health problem in hospitals, healthcare facilities and community settings. Pneumonia is the top disease-related cause for hospitalization. This study proposes to use data in electronic health records to classify pneumonia type and describe risk factors that may make individual susceptible to different types of pneumonia, including impact of diseases of the mouth, gums and teeth. The project expects to create models that can identify patients at risk for pneumonia based on information in their medical record so that those risks may be recognized and reduced.",Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings,9599192,R03DE027020,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Climate', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Hygiene', 'Dental Records', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Mouth Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nosocomial pneumonia', 'Oral', 'Oral health', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Periodontitis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal vaccine', 'Pneumonia', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Ventilator', 'Visit', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'case finding', 'clinically relevant', 'community setting', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outreach', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'pneumonia model', 'portability', 'secondary analysis', 'systems research', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia']",NIDCR,MARSHFIELD CLINIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION,R03,2018,174917,-0.009515331378157705
"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9584176,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2018,190000,-0.01771814872902465
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9538699,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic patients', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,190216,0.02878273063571022
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,9666625,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2018,194005,-0.012492691822501071
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this ﬁeld typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind admis- sion risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modiﬁable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital ad- missions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classiﬁcation models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to signiﬁcantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close men- toring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a support- ive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identiﬁcation and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,9505570,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'collaborative environment', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'trend', 'trial design']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2018,195205,-0.015496547354744301
"Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection Statement of Work There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests for the evaluation of the etiology of febrile states, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. This project will develop host-based biomarker signatures capable of identifying the presence and pathogen class of infections in vulnerable immunocompromised human subjects, thus potentially allowing for earlier, more directed (and thus more effective) therapy as well as reducing the need for potentially harmful empiric anti-infective therapy. In this study we will a) perform high dimensional gene expression analysis on existing samples of at-risk hosts with proven candidemia, viral infection, bacterial infection, or noninfectious illness, b) develop peripheral blood-based gene expression signatures of candidemia and c) generate a combined multinomial classifier capable of differentiating four clinical states: viral infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection (candidemia) and noninfectious illness. The enclosed work offers a true paradigm shift in the way febrile illnesses in this high-risk population are diagnosed and managed. Relevance Statement Timely and accurate differentiation of viral, bacterial, and fungal illness has important implications for both the individual patient and society as earlier/more accurate diagnosis may improve patient treatment and clinical outcomes as well as curb anti-microbial overusage and subsequent proliferation of resistant organisms.","Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection",9530534,R21AI132978,"['Acute', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Candida', 'Candidiasis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effector Cell', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fever', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Infectious Agent', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modality', 'Mycoses', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adjudicate', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'candidemia', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'evaluation/testing', 'genomic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'human subject', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'migration', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'peripheral blood', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'therapy outcome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAID,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,198750,-0.017138203057387995
"Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma PROJECT SUMMARY Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common aggressive type of lymphomas, is characterized by marked clinical and pathological heterogeneity that is reflected at the molecular level. It is well known that although the incidence rates for DLBCL were lower for African Americans (AA) than for European Americans (EA), AA patients were diagnosed at a significantly younger age and have worse 5-year survival compared with EA patients. The reason for this apparent racial/ethnic difference is unclear and cannot be fully explained by social stressors or access to care. We speculate that epigenetic variations could underlie the racial/ethnic differences because the pathogenesis of DLBCL is strongly linked to perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms, and population-specific cytosine modifications are a fundamental feature between human populations. In addition, greater epigenetic heterogeneity is linked with more aggressive DLBCL and poorer survival outcomes. Most prior studies of DLBCL epigenetics have assessed 5-methylcytosines (5mC) in predominantly EA patients. No studies have evaluated 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), an emerging stable and abundant modification with distinct gene regulatory and cellular functions, due mainly to technical limitations. Most importantly, no studies have assessed concurrently 5mC and 5hmC in both EA and AA DLBCL patients. Without an effective technique to obtain the complete landscape of modified cytosines, development of targeted epigenetic approaches to improve DLBCL disparities is unlikely. The objective of this Exploratory/Developmental study is to distinguish 5hmC from 5mC at the time of DLBCL diagnosis between AA and EA patients and evaluate their clinical significance. Our hypothesis is that the 5mC/5hmC signatures in tumor tissues differ between AA and EA patients and that these differences contribute to the well-known racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL risk and outcomes. The Specific Aims are to 1) distinguish 5hmC from 5mC in EA and AA patients and evaluate population-specific 5mC/5hmC loci; and 2) determine therapeutic response-associated 5hmC/5mC loci. Specifically, we will obtain tissues for 120 patients with DLBCL (60 AA and 60 EA) from the University of Chicago Lymphoma Biobank. We will combine an innovative technique, the Tet-assisted Bisulfite Sequencing (TAB-Seq) and the new Illumina EPIC array to accurately distinguish 5hmC from 5mC. We will perform an epigenome-wide scan to assess differences in 5hmC/5mC modification levels between AA and EA patients at presentation and also integrate both modifications to predict therapeutic response, defined as relapse within 24 months after treatment. This proposal addresses a critical research question in a highly innovative, cost-efficient, and timely manner, providing important data for the first time on the complete landscape of modified cytosines for racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL. The results are expected to have positive impact because it is possible that the identified epigenetic loci/biomarkers will provide new targets for individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to decrease mortality and burden of DLBCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans were diagnosed of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most aggressive lymphoma in adults, at a significantly younger age (54 years vs. 65 years) and have worse 5-year survival (45% vs. 54%) compared with European American patients. This work seeks to understand the biological bases of the racial/ethnic differences by identifying complete DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation signatures at the time of diagnosis between African American and European American patients with DLBCL. Successful completion of this study will lead to a much better understanding of epigenetic factors that underlie the apparent racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL, which should accelerate the development of race-based individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to substantially reduce the disparities observed in DLBCL among patients from different ethnic groups.",Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma,9572405,R21MD011439,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'American', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'Cell physiology', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endometrium', 'Enhancers', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevention approach', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Race', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinically significant', 'cost efficient', 'disparity reduction', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'ethnic difference', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'social', 'stressor', 'survival outcome', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor initiation']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2018,200434,-0.0025534826737029265
"Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization Project summary Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health and criminal justice problem that negatively impacts millions of victims yearly in the United States, primarily women (85%). Most IPV-related healthcare visits (83%) occurred in an emergency department (ED), and these clinical encounters are unique opportunities to identify IPV victims and potentially provide assistance. Although numerous health professional organizations have endorsed universal screening and counseling for IPV since 1992, actual screening rates, detection of IPV victims, and referrals to IPV services remain low in the ED. As a result, many IPV victims pass through the ED unidentified and untreated. Computerized screening tools have been developed and implemented in clinical settings in order to assist providers in screening and detecting IPV. However, these tools have a great limitation in that they rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHR). Recently, researchers demonstrated that a history of IPV diagnoses and associated clinical symptoms highly predict current and future IPV (OR=7.8), and these important IPV data could serve as red flags that trigger providers to assess patients further for IPV. In order to enhance IPV screening in the ED, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summarizer that extracts, abstracts and synthesizes patient historical IPV data (structured and unstructured), and delivers patient historical IPV data to ED providers through an intuitive interface. The specific aims are: 1) develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) strategies to identify and extract patient historical IPV incidents and timelines from clinic notes; 2) develop and evaluate a web service-based summary tool (IPV-Summary-Service) that synthesizes patient- specific IPV information from both NLP-processed data elements and structured data; and 3) develop and pilot test an enhanced IPV screening strategy that delivers clinical evidence generated by the IPV-Summary- Service through a specific EHR (Epic) to providers during the patient universal IPV screening in the ED. This automatic clinical date summary for IPV will be piloted in one ED at MUSC. There are two major outcomes to be measured for the IPV-Summary enhanced screening for 6 months before and after the index date of pilot testing: 1) rate of successful referral to the IPV 24-hour dedicated IPV nurse; and 2) rate of initiation of referral and identification of persons at high risk of IPV. We will use mixed effect generalized linear regression models to estimate the effects of IPV-Summary on the referral rate and IPV case identification rate. Through survey studies, we will assess secondary outcomes including factors of system feasibility, usability, and providers' satisfaction. These analyses can identify potentially important correlates of the major outcomes and may help us improve the design of the intervention. The results from this study will form the foundation for a broader implementation in a regional health information exchange for EDs. Narrative Computer-based approaches for intimate partner violence (IPV) universal screening have led to significantly higher screening rate and detection rate, as well as receipt of IPV services in the emergency department (ED). However, these approaches rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal IPV data existing in electronic health records (EHR), which have high predictive power of IPV risk. In order to enhance the effectiveness of IPV screening, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summary tool that extracts, abstracts, and synthesizes patient historical IPV information from EHR and then delivers that critical information to ED providers at the point of care.",Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization,9520862,R21LM012945,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Event', 'Face', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Professional', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Violent injury', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'intimate partner violence', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability', 'web services']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2018,201825,-0.011641809681371516
"A Protocol-Driven, Digital Conversational Agent at the Hospital Bedside to Support Nurse Teams and to Mitigate Delirium and Falls Risk Abstract About 700,000 to 1 million falls per year occur during hospital stays in the US, costing hospitals $3 billion to $7 billion each year to treat. These costs are not reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, resulting in significant financial losses for hospitals. Delirium, a major cause of falls, is highly prevalent (29%-64%) among hospitalized elders. Even without causing a fall, the average case of delirium increases the length of stay by 7.78 days, disrupting throughput and significantly reducing net hospital revenues. Including the common sequelae of post-discharge functional decline, delirium costs the national healthcare system over $130 billion per year. Due to the high cost and significant psychosocial needs of certain hospitalized patients, a widely-used intervention to mitigate risk is to assign hospital staff & nurses to serve as “patient sitters” at the bedside, at a cost of $1 million/year for a typical hospital. However, despite the workforce burden and expense, patient sitters often do not reliably execute risk-mitigating protocols, and the literature does not support their efficacy in preventing adverse events. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we seek to develop an advanced, human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) avatar system to enhance the wellbeing of hospitalized patients, avoid adverse events including delirium and falls, and improve workforce efficiency by supporting nursing staff to work at the top of their license, potentially generating savings of $2,000,000 each year for a typical 300-bed hospital. This proposal aligns with NINR’s cross-cutting focus areas of Promoting Innovation and 21st Century Nurse Scientists, while applying the principles of patient self-management and wellness to the acute care environment, where the outcomes driven by our patient engagement and support platform will have an outsized, immediate cost benefit to enable rapid scaling and dissemination.

"Prehospital and Emergency Room Stroke Diagnosis Using Quantitative Cerebral Hemodynamics Large vessel acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the leading cause of disability and fourth leading cause of death with approximately 250,000 per year in the United States alone. Although treatments including interventional (stentriever) and pharmaceutical (tPA) exist for large vessel occlusion (LVO), there is not a rapid prehospital tool for diagnoses which guides the use of the correct therapy. Because the time to treatment for stroke is critical, there is a large need for a device which can be used in ambulances and other prehospital environments so that patients are rapidly provided the correct care. Currently, computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging is the standard of care but its use is limited to the hospital or in some cases multimillion dollar stroke on wheels ambulances which are not practical. There is a significant delay that occurs between stroke onset and diagnosis by the time CTA is performed and read resulting in unnecessary death or disability. More delay occurs when patients need to be transferred to a stroke center because the hospital they are at does not perform interventional therapy. Rapid diagnosis in a prehospital setting will enable patients to be taken to the correct hospital and provide LVO location to surgeons in the operating suite.  As the critical factor affecting cerebral anatomy in AIS patients is the limitation of blood flow to the brain the most likely technology to assist in diagnosis of LVO is one that can measure flow directly. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) has been used to directly measure blood flow velocity since 1982 but it relies on a trained operator skilled in both finding the affected vessel as well as interpreting a complicated waveform. Guidelines already exist for how to diagnose LVO with TCD and hospitals with a trained operator currently use it. However, it’s not used in smaller hospitals, urgent care or ambulance settings due to the training requirements.  This work will revolutionize TCD for stroke diagnosis because it removes the need for a trained operator; key for mass adoption of the technology. TCD is already small and portable so it can easily fit in an ambulance similar in size to an automated external defibrillator. This work will use machine learning techniques we have developed to analyze the morphology of TCD waveforms and provide diagnosis information. The key is the ability to remove the operator variability by understanding how waveform morphology of stroke changes based on depth relative to occlusion so that the need to measure in a precise location is eliminated. Our preliminary results show 95% accuracy for LVO diagnosis but we need to broaden our dataset while updating our algorithms. Phase I will use our FDA Cleared Lucid M1 Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound System to measure confirmed stroke subjects after CTA imaging and update our algorithm. Phase II will use algorithms developed in Phase I with a fully automated TCD system we have developed with investor funding that does not require an operator or trained sonographer. We currently have Western IRB approval and are upgrading usability features of the device for ease of use with minimal training. Large vessel acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the leading cause of disability and fourth leading cause of death with approximately 250,000 per year in the United States alone. This work will reduce the time to treatment for stroke by developing necessary algorithms to diagnose AIS with a portable ultrasound technology which measures cerebral blood flow velocity.

"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis.

"HEART: Adding Memory to Reasoning: macHine lEArning tailoRed drug Titration Hypertension (HTN) affects 73 million Americans, with an annual hospitalization cost of $113 billion/year. Clinical trial outcomes of optima4BP (O4BP), a clinical reasoning artificial intelligence (AI) system, determined that the success/failure of past anti-HTN medication treatments can be utilized to improve O4BP predictive performance. Our objective for this Phase I proposal is to investigate the feasibility of building a past treatment success/failure “memory” function into O4BP. O4BP, an innovation of Optima Integrated Health, is functional at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC), the clinical collaborating partner. O4BP AI safely optimizes HTN medication treatment independent of in-office visits. It collects and analyzes current patient health information from multiple sources to determine if a medication optimization is required. O4BP then alerts the physician of a need for a medication change by providing a clinically supported treatment recommendation action. In this Phase I, we propose the development and validation of O4BP's “memory” by using the principles of Instance Based Learning (IBL). Known for its flexibility and intuitive logic, the IBL theory will be adapted to enhance the predictive treatment efficacy power of O4BP. It will lead to incorporating the patient response (success/failure) from past treatments to rank the efficacy of candidate treatments identified by O4BP for HTN medication optimization. Clinical resources [e.g., Electronic Health Record (EHR)] provide incomplete patient information, insufficient to build the “memory” functionality using retrospective datasets. Therefore, in Aim 1, a clinical trial (n=50) will be conducted to collect complete patient datasets that will be used to build the “memory” function: (a) BP data from remotely monitored BP; (b) EHR updates to the patient's profile since last cycle data dump; and (c) personalized online surveys for patient reporting of medication adherence, side- effects (SEs), and cardiovascular symptoms. Aim 2 will utilize the datasets to develop an efficacy proximity map 2x/month of candidate treatments to past treatments using IBL theory. The proximity map will be based on scored past treatment(s) efficacy, defined as a combination of success in BP lowering, reducing of SEs, and targeting minimum number of drugs with maximum BP lowering power. The treatment recommendation alert will be sent to the physician, for consideration. This study design allows immediate clinical adjudication of the IBL “memory” through physician's choice to implement/reject the treatment action alert, made available 2x/month for each patient. “Memory” enhanced O4BP is expected to lead to a systolic BP (SBP) reduction ≥10mmHg by the end of the scheduled 12 months treatment optimization period. Successful development and validation will position the “memory” enhanced O4BP for deployment at UCSF MC that serves approximately 20,000 patients with an SBP >160mmHg, poorly controlled, and at high risk for primary or recurrent stroke, heart failure or myocardial infarction. Our long-term objective is to transform the reactive and punctuated nature of HTN medication treatment management into a proactive and ongoing component of patient care. Our goal is to simplify the medication management of high blood pressure (BP) for the treating physician while improving the quality of care of patients and reducing the associated costs. We will develop an artificial processing intelligence that will allow our current product, optima4BP, to enhance its efficacy evaluation of candidate medication treatments as a function of past treatments performance. optima4BP is a decision support clinical reasoning artificial intelligence designed to safely optimize medication treatment by a physician, independent of in-office visits in patients with poorly controlled BP.",HEART: Adding Memory to Reasoning: macHine lEArning tailoRed drug Titration,9461180,R43HL140624,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart failure', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intelligence', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Validation', 'adjudication', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'college', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'profiles in patients', 'response', 'stroke incidence', 'success', 'system architecture', 'theories', 'treatment optimization', 'vector']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R43,2018,224090,0.009005565525394969
"A wearable device to detect opioid overdose and to prevent death Bioresp Technologies, Inc. proposes development of RespiLife, a new wearable device to to track physiologic data for early detection of opioid overdose and to relay data and the generated alerts to relevant caregivers for further intervention. The goal is to reduce the number opioids-related deaths by early detection of overdose. Opioid epidemic death toll has quadrupled since 1999. About half of those deaths are due to prescription opioids and for the most part are unintentional. RespiLife tracks oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and pulse rate and based on a machine learning algorithm will determine changes from the baseline and correlation of those changes with changes in medications. Our specific aims are: (1) Production of five working prototypes with their algorithm to use in our validation study. (2) A validation study to compare our data with a gold-standard device and carry out statistical analysis for evaluation of agreement and accuracy.

"Planning Changing Talk Online (CHATO): a Clinical Trial Testing the Effects of Online Communication Training for Nursing Home Staff on Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Residents with Dementia Abstract  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk, which is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. The next step to increase the impact of this effective classroom-based training is to test CHAT content provided in online internet modules. CHAT training Online (CHATO) can improve access for busy staff and those in rural and small NHs to increase dissemination across care settings to improve dementia care.  This 1-year R34 Clinical Trial Planning Grant will prepare for a future clinical trial (in response to PA- 17-014, Addressing Unmet Needs in Persons with Dementia to Decrease Behavioral Symptoms and Improve Quality of Life) that will test the effects of CHATO training on resident BPSD in 120 NHs. The R34 project will orient our multidisciplinary research team to address new aims; recruit and enroll NHs; develop the clinical trial protocol, manual of operations, study documents, and data forms; solidify plans for data management and sharing and fidelity assurance, and obtain IRB approvals. The feasibility of an elderspeak feedback app for staff that may improve CHATO effects will also be demonstrated in the NH to prepare for the clinical trial.  In the planned R01 clinical trial, 120 NHs will be randomized to the CHATO training group or to the control group. BPSD data, extracted from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Nursing Home Compare and Minimum Data Set, will be compared using linear mixed modeling. NH strategies used to engage staff in CHATO (paid time off, recognition) and costs for various approaches will be identified. The effects of a self-monitoring app that uses natural language processing to give staff immediate feedback on their elderspeak use will be tested. This research addresses NINR's symptom management and caregiver support missions, NIA's milestones for nonpharmacological dementia care interventions, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease goal to enhance care quality and efficiency, and the Alzheimer's Association Plan to build a workforce with high-quality care skills. The potential for reducing inappropriate use of psychoactive medications to control BPSD will be explored, addressing the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. Narrative The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease has identified education of dementia care providers as a top priority to address the need for quality care for the population of persons with dementia that will triple in the next 30 years. This R34 clinical trial planning grant will prepare for a future clinical trial testing online interactive communication training for nursing home staff that reduces ineffective elderspeak communication and behavioral and psychological symptoms of persons with dementia.

"Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an innovative relative risk model predicting incidence of complications in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients. Spine surgery is a rapidly growing area of health care expenditures; complications in spine surgery significantly add to health care spending and may impact patient outcomes. The elderly, as one of the priority populations studied in research funded by AHRQ, are more prone than are many other groups to perioperative complications. Poor understanding of complication incidence makes patient counseling and shared decision making difficult. Better understanding of how patient factors contribute to operative outcomes may significantly improve patient engagement in discussion of treatment options. Development of a clinical tool that may predict occurrence of complications in spine surgery would be an innovative and valuable addition to the practice of spine surgery. This effort will build upon developed measures incorporating patient comorbidities, choice of surgical approach, and pre-operative diagnosis into a model estimating risk of complication occurrence. The principle goal of our research effort has been to build optimized and validated predictive models of complications after spinal surgery. A retrospective database assessment will be conducted, using the Medicare and Marketscan databases. Statistical analysis of the databases will be used to generate an appropriate adverse event predictive model, where the impact of individual comorbidities and other patient and procedure factors contributing to higher complication incidence is assessed. The study will aggregate patient data into appropriate cohorts, and analyze the data with logistic regression, CART, and other modeling methods. The innovative goal of this investigation will be to predict both risk of any complication and occurrence of specific types of complications in spinal surgery. After a predictive tool has been developed, the measure will be applied prospectively to spinal surgery patients, where complications will be prospectively assessed by an independent auditor and correlated with recording of patient centered outcome metrics recorded concurrently in our clinic. Appreciation of how patient factors contribute to surgical outcomes will significantly improve patient education and aid informed decision making, may benefit patient care, and will contribute to implementation of comparative effectiveness relative risk adjustment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Spine surgery has consistently manifested significant growth and is a large source of health care spending; many spine surgery procedures are performed upon older, Medicare-aged patients. Helping patients understand the risks of operative interventions will improve patient education, contribute to realistic patient expectations of surgical outcomes, and will yield better quality of life for surgical candidates. This study will develop a patient-centered measure of the risk of perioperative adverse events in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients, and correlate this measure to patient reported quality of life measures.",Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery,9536656,R01HS023800,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,246106,0.016281139511524358
"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9600732,R21MD012693,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consultations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Telemedicine', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Triage', 'Underserved Population', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'care delivery', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'ethnic minority population', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trend', 'two-dimensional']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,278902,0.0048623182459185885

"Adolescent Personality and the Incidence of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Related Dementias in Later Life. Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s related dementias (ADRD) are now regarded as a public health problem of pressing importance. While the race for disease-altering treatments continues, another strand of work has focused on identifying social and psychological precursors of these conditions. Such biopsychosocial risks often can be traced back to phases of life that predate symptom onset by years or decades. Therefore, a robust social and life course epidemiology of ADRD requires study designs that feature a) broad and deep psychosocial characterization of b) a large, population-relevant cohort c) during early phases of life, with d) medically-documented outcome data. Parent project R01AG053155 features a) through c), specifically in 90,000 members of the Project Talent cohort assessed in 1960 and again in 1970-74. The current supplement expands its scope to all members of Project Talent baseline (roughly 340,000) from 1960, and focuses on two scientific aims. The first seeks to estimate the relative risk of ADRD by the early 70s arising from adolescent personality traits, as documented in Medicare data linked to the cohort. One key feature of this aim is to determine if aspects of personality in adolescence are associated with ADRD incidence in later life independently of adolescent IQ, which is a known predictor. The second key aspect of this aim is to use the size and population representativeness of the sample to derive reasonably precise population-relevant effect size estimates of personality relative risks, and compare these effect sizes to benchmark risk estimates of adolescent IQ and socioeconomic status, which are considered to have policy and public health significance. The second aim also leverages the size and scope of the sample to identify personality traits which may moderate the ADRD risk of low adolescent IQ, in more complex and realistic patterns than can be studied in smaller or less representative data sets. This is accomplished via machine learning methods focused on identifying non-linear interactions via intensive cross-validation, another scientific question that takes full advantage of the size and scope of this unique cohort. Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s related dementias are on the rise, due to both increasing life spans and the size of the Baby Boom generation as it reaches these later years. While scientists have yet to develop cures for dementias, it may be possible to learn how to prevent or delay their onset by studying life circumstances that give rise to these conditions. The goal of this project is to determine how personality traits in adolescence may compensate for the dementia risk posed by low adolescence IQ scores.",Adolescent Personality and the Incidence of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Related Dementias in Later Life.,9688395,R01AG053155,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Baby Booms', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deltastab', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biopsychosocial', 'cohort', 'epidemiologic data', 'exhaustion', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'parent project', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'public health priorities', 'social', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2018,287001,-0.05035664895188647
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data.

"Pediatric sepsis prediction: a machine learning solution for patient diversity Abstract  Significance:  In  this  SBIR  project,  we  propose  to  predict  and  detect  pediatric  severe  sepsis  by  developing  a  machine-­learning-­based  clinical  decision  support  system  for  electronic  health  record  (EHR)  pediatric  sepsis  screening. The pediatric population is underserved, with fundamental research and understanding of pediatric  sepsis  syndromes  lagging  behind  that  of  the  adult  population.  The  proposed  work  will  develop  machine  learning sepsis predictions on the highly heterogeneous pediatric population, by combining multi-­task learning  methods with expert clinical knowledge of how pediatric sepsis presentation is dependent on age and on pre-­ existing  conditions.  The  multi-­task  learning  approach  will  use  age  or  comorbidities  to  define  “tasks,”  each  one  associated  with  prediction  on  a  particular  subpopulation,  and  then  link  the  learning  process  together  between  tasks. Research Questions: Which methods of using these task-­defining parameters are most effective? How  can  we  most  effectively  learn  the  degree  of  similarity  between  pediatric  subpopulations  and  leverage  this  to  improve classification performance? Prior Work: InSight was originally developed to predict sepsis and septic  shock from adult EHR data. After retraining on pediatric cases, in preliminary experiments with a retrospective  set  of  pediatric  (2-­17  yr)  inpatient  encounters  (n  =  11,127;;  103  [0.9%]  severely  septic),  at  the  University  of  California  San  Francisco  (UCSF),  InSight  achieved  an  AUROC  0.912  and  0.727  for  the  detection  and  4-­hour  pre-­onset  prediction  of  sepsis.  This  performance  can  be  improved  for  better  pediatric  sepsis  prediction.  Specific  Aims:  To  empirically  evaluate  different  learning  schemes  using  age  with  and  without  multi-­task  methods,  within  the  UCSF  pediatric  severe  sepsis  data  set  (Aim  1).  To  exploit  an  expert-­proposed  network  graph  structure  for  comorbidity-­described  pediatric  subpopulations  that  provides  superior  predictive  performance  over  naïve  methods  and  graphs,  both  for  the  overall  population  and  for  underserved  subpopulations  (Aim  2).  Methods:  We  propose  to  use  multi-­task  methods  that  penalize  deviations  between  classifiers  on  neighboring  tasks  and  that  iteratively  learn  the  strength  of  these  links.  These  methods  will  be  compared with total task independence, or passing age into classifier training as an ordinary input. Criteria for  Success:  Success  will  be  shown  by  4-­hour  pre-­onset  AUROC  gains  of  0.02  (overall  population)  and  0.03  for  the previously weakest of three age subpopulations (2-­5, 6-­12, and 13-­17 yrs;; 4-­hour pre-­onset prediction, p <  0.05, McNemar’s test, 4-­fold cross-­validation). The best structure for mapping similarities between comorbidity  tasks will improve the overall AUROC by 0.03 (p < 0.05) and by 0.07 for ≥ 2 comorbidity subpopulations of ≥ 100 patients (p < 0.05). Outcome: These improvements will enable InSight to deliver strong sepsis predictive

"Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT [ Pediatric specialists are often required to identify infants who are likely to suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcome, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is the most common developmental disability among children in the United States and results from several factors, including low weight for gestational age, premature birth, and stroke. Although MRI and cranial ultrasound (cUS) provide valuable structural information in the preterm period, they have moderate sensitivity to CP and require transportation of the infant. Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have validated the clinical potential of General Movement Assessment (GMA) for CP risk identification. During the early period, (23 weeks to 36 weeks gestational age), the presence of Cramped Synchronized General Movements (CSGMs), has demonstrated very high sensitivity and specificity for CP, conjointly ranging from 80%-98%. CSGMs are assessed while preterm infants are still in an acute care facility (NICU) and can inform the clinician independently, and in combination with cUS and MRI. Despite its potential, GMA is available in only a few clinical centers, as adoption and routine application depend on lengthy, cost-intensive observation and availability of specially trained raters. A Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) is proposed that will automate GMA for bedside evaluations in both preterm and postterm periods. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology not only for routine risk identification, but also for establishing disease trajectory and potentially differentiating CP subtypes and assessing efficacy of emerging treatments along the early developmental continuum.  Preliminary studies at UC Irvine have demonstrated that GMA analysis for CSGMs can be automated by quantifying infant limb movement using highly miniaturized, 3-axis wireless accelerometers and classifying CSGMs using a patented Markov-type approach that merges an application-specific Erlang-Cox state transition model with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (“EC-DBN”), treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling CSGM (and non-CSGM) duration and interval. In Phase I, this approach will be utilized in a comparative evaluation of two movement measurement modalities to determine which has the best overall performance and clinical utility at three leading NICU centers. Infant movement data will be concurrently acquired using an advanced, second generation prototype wireless accelerometer system (CPRIS-A) and a high definition 3D (infrared) optical camera (CPRIS-O). The optical modality offers significant potential advantages as it requires no infant contact and can monitor unattended, intermittently, over weeks or months. However, its potential for GMA automation must be systematically evaluated. Classifier results from both modalities will be compared to expert rater consensus in 80 preterm infants. The primary outcome will be CSGM identification accuracy, as determined by ROC-AUC analyses, with a threshold for success of 0.85. Additional comparative performance measures include reliability and practicability in the NICU environment. An Advisory Committee of experts in the fields of neonatology, pediatrics and cerebral palsy will evaluate project results and advise on the clinical potential of each modality. ] PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood, with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per 1000 in high-income countries. The overall project goal is to develop a computerized hardware-software system capable of identifying preterm infants at high risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP), based on the systematic identification of specific patterns of movement-derived features. The Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) will enable clinical staff with only minimal training to cost effectively implement General Movement Assessment (GMA) for Cramped Synchronous General Movements (CSGMs), with interpretive reporting performed automatically. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology for advancement in the identification, characterization and treatment assessment of CP.",Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System,9621149,R43NS098840,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Budgets', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Compromising', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Muscle Cramp', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neonatology', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'comparative', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'critical period', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'digital', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'heuristics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'limb movement', 'miniaturize', 'new technology', 'perinatal brain', 'postnatal period', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,"NEUROCOMP SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2018,300502,-0.01429038894507585
"Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis Abstract Craniosynostosis affects close to one in 2000 newborns and causes growth restriction perpendicular to the affected suture. Metopic craniosynostosis is the second most common form of craniosynostosis. The metopic suture is an important sight of cranial growth as the brain rapidly expands in the ﬁrst year of life. Patients affected by metopic craniosynostosis will present in the ﬁrst few months of life with varying degrees of narrowing of the forehead and brow, a triangular shaped head, and an abnormal eye position. Surgery is recommended early in childhood to normalize the head shape and expand the restricted skull to prevent complications such as headaches, cognitive impairment, and visual disturbances including blindness.  Imaging with computed tomography (CT) is employed to conﬁrm new diagnoses of metopic craniosynostosis and, together with the physical exam, is used in a descriptive and qualitative manner to assess the degree of head shape abnormality. Several methods have been employed to interpret the information provided in the CT scans to allow surgeons to utilize data for surgical decision making. However, these indices reduce the complex three-dimensional skull dysmorphology into isolated measurements of angles or proportions, require detailed calculations to perform, and no universally accepted standard has emerged so far despite signiﬁcant research efforts and clinical motivation.  In this grant proposal, we aim to increase our understanding of the cranial dysmorphology in patients with metopic craniosynostosis by employing latest results from statistical shape modeling and deep learning. Specif- ically, we will build a statistical shape model of pediatric skulls from CT images of patients with metopic cran- iosynostosis as well as a group of normal controls capturing normal phenotypical shape variations. The distance of a new shape from the normative shape space will represent the proposed Shape Normality Metric (SNM). The SNM will be validated against ratings from experts in the surgical community (current standard of care) who will be asked to assess the dysmorphology of the skulls in our database. To avoid surgeons' subjective bias, we will aggregate their response using statistical methods that compensate for potential individual bias. Finally, to streamline data collection for future research we will develop a head-shape portal that will allow users to upload CT scans of their patients and the system will automatically calculate the SNM.  By developing a severity metric that encompasses the entire extent of dysmorphology in metopic craniosyn- ostosis and establishing a head-shape portal, we will improve our understanding of the spectrum of metopic craniosynostosis, aid in pre-operative and surgical decision making, enable future research, and help facilitate longitudinal outcomes assessments and multi-center communication and collaboration. Narrative This grant proposal aims to improve our understanding of the head shape anomaly associated with metopic craniosynostosis by using recent results from statistical shape analysis and deep learning, with the goal of developing an objective metopic cranioynostosis severity scale. Different from previously proposed metrics, our approach evaluates the entire shape as a whole. With this information, surgeons will be able to objectively determine how severely affected their patients are and will be better able to tailor their interventions to the needs of their individual patients. Additionally, surgeons will be able to better communicate with each other and study the effects of surgical intervention on their patients which will improve patient care in the long run.",Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis,9669833,R21EB026061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Deformity', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye Abnormalities', 'Forehead', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Headache', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint structure of suture of skull', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Socialization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereophotogrammetries', 'Stratification', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Trauma patient', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'operation', 'patient stratification', 'power analysis', 'premature', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'self esteem', 'shape analysis', 'standard of care', 'surgery outcome', 'web-based tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2018,317513,-0.01176584115809928
"Using clinical treatment data in a machine learning approach for sepsis detection Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project, we propose to develop novel software, “HindSight”, that will improve InSight, a machine-learning based clinical decision support (CDS) system for sepsis prediction and detection. HindSight will identify clinicians’ sepsis-related decisions in the records of former patients; it will then use these events to supply InSight with labeled examples of sepsis cases, incorporating clinicians’ judgement to demonstrate appropriate and inappropriate alarms. Together with an online training module that accordingly refines InSight’s predictors, this capability will enable InSight to quickly adapt to the idiosyncrasies of a particular clinical deployment, reduce false or irrelevant alarms, and do both without explicit human supervision. Research Question: Can a machine-learning-based, retrospective labeler learn to autonomously label sepsis and sepsis treatments by integrating the total clinical record, thereby providing many high-quality examples and labels for training a sepsis CDS? In concert with an online learning algorithm, can this labeler facilitate online, supervised learning without explicit human intervention? Prior Work: We have developed InSight for application in a number of sepsis prediction settings. Existing InSight classifiers attain an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88 for sepsis detection, and 0.74 for 4-hour early sepsis prediction. Specific Aims: To identify patients who were evaluated for sepsis, treated for sepsis, or who actually had sepsis using the retrospective clinical patient record and label them accordingly (Aim 1); to use these labels with an online learning algorithm to implement autonomous, supervised learning of alert behavior which reflects clinician judgement (Aim 2). Methods: We will identify evaluated, treated, and septic patients using a machine learning labeler trained on retrospective data from patients’ electronic health records (EHR) at time of discharge. Using a set of 100 test cases (≥ 20 septic) hand-annotated by our clinician investigators, we will assess the labeler’s performance. Labeling AUROC ≥ 0.95 will constitute success in Aim 1. We will develop an online learning algorithm which enables InSight to continuously retrain during deployment. With Aim 1’s labeler, we will simulate a deployment with online learning, producing a learning curve of predictive AUROC on a held-out test set versus number of observed patients. Aim 2 will be successful if the online training results in superior area under the learning curve versus the initial model and periodic retraining. All experiments will be executed using the MIMIC-III data set. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the InSight system with an online, HindSight-based retraining module will be deployed at partner hospitals for prospective studies. Narrative Clinical decision support (CDS) systems present critical information to medical professionals by examining patient data and providing alerts. Machine learning is a powerful method for creating CDS tools, but it requires labels which reflect the desired alert behavior. We will develop software that examines discharged patients’ electronic health records (EHR), identifies clinicians’ sepsis treatment decisions and patient outcomes, and passes these labeled examples to an online algorithm for retraining InSight, our machine-learning-based CDS tool for real-time sepsis prediction.",Using clinical treatment data in a machine learning approach for sepsis detection,9557659,R43TR002309,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Drops', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pythons', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'research clinical testing', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'software development', 'success', 'support tools']",NCATS,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,324971,0.013399142213227747
"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9706344,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,331584,0.015321784751949518
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias. Results from this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations.",Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae,9540056,R01MH110453,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Attention', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Etiology', 'Explosion', 'Family', 'Fire - disasters', 'Future', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personality Disorders', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Poisoning', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Variant', 'Work', 'assault', 'base', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'member', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sexual assault', 'social', 'time use', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2018,333874,-0.004651610296818213
"Early Identification of Acute Kidney Injury Using Deep Recurrent Neural Nets, Presented with Probable Etiology Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project we propose to develop Previse, a novel, software-based clinical decision support (CDS) system for predicting acute kidney injury (AKI), and attributing AKI to one of several causal mechanisms (etiologies). Previse will use machine learning methods and information drawn from the electronic health record (EHR) to identify the early signs of acute kidney injury. By doing so before the clinical syndrome of AKI is fully developed, Previse will give clinicians the time to intervene with the goals of preventing further kidney damage, and decreasing the sequelae of AKI. Combining this prediction module with a second module that suggests the underlying causes responsible for an incipient or full AKI, Previse will enable clinicians to make earlier and better-informed treatment decisions for AKI patients. Research Question: Can a machine- learning-based CDS predict the development and progression of AKI in hospitalized patients 72 hours in advance of KDIGO stage 2 or 3, with performance providing an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of at least 0.85? Is it possible to use a Bayesian model to infer the cause of AKI with high accuracy (AUROC ≥ 0.75)? Prior work: We have developed a prototype version of the Previse system which predicts AKI up to 72 hours in advance of KDIGO stage 2 or 3 criteria, with an AUROC near 0.70. We have previously developed machine-learning-based predictive tools for sepsis, in-hospital mortality, and other adverse patient events with performance significantly improved over commonly used rules-based scoring systems. Specific Aims: To predict the onset of chart-abstracted KDIGO stage 2 or 3 AKI in retrospective data, 72 hours in advance (Aim 1); to use data drawn from the EHR to identify the cause of AKI at time of onset with high accuracy, and to present this causal inference, its likelihood, and relevant evidence supporting it in a human-interpretable fashion (Aim 2). Methods: We will predict the onset of AKI using a deep, recurrent neural network (RNN). This expressive, nonlinear classifier will incorporate time-series information in the qualitative portions of the EHR and will also incorporate features derived from text components, such as radiology reports. Labeling AUROC of 0.85 or higher at 72 hours pre-KDIGO AKI will constitute success in Aim 1. In Aim 2, we will train a dynamic Bayesian network to identify the cause of AKI. We will train this system using semi-supervised methods, where the causes of a set of AKI examples will be hand-annotated by clinician experts; these examples will be split into two groups, with some used for training and the remainder for testing. Aim 2 will be successful if this training results in etiology identification accuracy of at least 0.75 in the test set. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the combined Previse system will be deployed for prospective studies at partner hospitals. Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects approximately 7% of all hospitalized patients each year in the United States, causing short-term and lasting harm, including increased risk of mortality. However, the existing tools for acute kidney injury detection have failed to offer significant anticipation of full-blown AKI, or to provide the insight into the AKI’s root cause, which are needed to make an impact on patient outcomes. We will develop Previse, a machine-learning-based prediction system that continuously monitors for incipient AKI and offers clinicians probable root causes of AKI.","Early Identification of Acute Kidney Injury Using Deep Recurrent Neural Nets, Presented with Probable Etiology",9621546,R43AA027674,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head Start Program', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Plant Roots', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recurrence', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'computer based statistical methods', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'trend']",NIAAA,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,349320,-0.0023067627232011686
"Improving patient and caregiver engagement through the application of data science methods to audio recorded clinic visits stored in personal health libraries PROJECT SUMMARY    Forty to eighty percent of clinic visit information is forgotten by patients immediately post visit, a significant  barrier to self-­management leading to poor health outcomes. Visit summaries can improve recall, yet patient  uptake is limited and clinicians report significant burden in creating summaries for laypeople. Patients are  beginning to audio record visits and clinics are now offering this service. When patients receive a clinic  recording, 71% listen and 68% share it with a caregiver, resulting in improved understanding and self-­ management. Yet, unstructured recordings are difficult to navigate. Personal health libraries (PHLs) may help  patients organize health information;; yet current PHLs do not facilitate clinic-­recordings. The objective of this  project is to develop a PHL that integrates clinic audio-­recordings (Audio-­PHL), using data science methods to  link medical terms from the recording to trustworthy patient resources, which can be retrieved, organized,  edited and shared by patients. The specific aims are: Aim 1 Identify health information seeking needs and  strategies of older adults with multimorbidity and caregivers;; Aim 2 Develop an Audio-­PHL using data science  methods to securely analyze clinic visit recordings and make this information accessible and understandable  for patients;; and Aim 3 Demonstrate the usability and use of an Audio-­PHL in older adults with multimorbidity  and caregivers. Applicants hypothesize: (1) The Audio-­PHL will surpass acceptable usability metrics in older  adults and caregivers and (2) natural language processing (NLP) methods developed for the Audio-­PHL will  accurately identify key visit information (e.g. medication) and connect it to credible patient resources. The  development of the Audio-­PHL follows a user centered design model. In Aim 1, the applicants will use  participatory design activities with 48 end-­users to inform Audio-­PHL design. In Aim 2, the Audio-­PHL will be  created in iterative cycles informed by findings from Aim 1. In Aim 3, extensive usability evaluation will be  conducted in human computer interaction (HCI) laboratory settings to ensure Audio-­PHL surpasses acceptable  usability metrics. Field testing of the Audio-­PHL will follow via a patient-­randomized pilot trial with older adults  with multimorbidity from primary care. Participants (N=70) will receive an Audio-­PHL (intervention) or PHL  (control) with no recordings. Usability metrics and satisfaction will be assessed at one-­month. Preliminary data  on the impact of an Audio-­PHL on patient ability to seek, find and use health information with high confidence,  patient activation and caregiver confidence will also be gathered. The research is innovative because it will  provide patients and caregivers secure access to a PHL based on clinic-­recordings that uses data science  methods to organize visit information and connect it to trusted resources. The results are expected to have a  major positive impact because they will provide proof-­of-­principle for the use of an Audio-­PHL that utilizes the  benefits of clinic recordings through the novel application of data science methods, to improve health outcomes  for older adults with multimorbidity through greater knowledge and confidence in their ability to self-­manage.   PROJECT NARRATIVE    Between 40 – 80% of clinic visit information is forgotten immediately by patients, a significant impediment to  self-­management for older adults with multimorbidity that leads to poor health outcomes. The proposed  research will integrate audio-­recordings of clinic visits into a Personal Health Library (Audio-­PHL), using data  science methods to link medical terms from the recording to trustworthy patient resources, which can be  retrieved, organized, edited and shared by patients. It is expected that the Audio-­PHL will be easy to use and

"Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults (AD/ADRD-Focused Administrative Supplement) Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults: AD/ADRD-Focused  Administrative Supplement Summary Dementia affects over 5 million older adults in the US, with vast implications for individual patients, their caregivers, and social programs designed to support increasing health care needs. Research to date has not fully clarified the role that multiple co-occurring chronic conditions (multimorbidity) play in the provision of appropriate care for racially and ethnically diverse groups of older adults with mild or more severe cognitive impairment. As a result, there is a need for greater understanding of the complex interactions between existing morbidity combinations, cognitive impairment, and the receipt of essential and appropriate care. As of yet, it is unclear whether specific multimorbidity combinations alongside cognitive impairment present greater difficulty in accessing good-quality, and appropriate care and preventive services among older adults from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds. The supplement extends from the research conducted in the parent award by focusing on older adults with cognitive impairment or dementia and co-existing chronic conditions. The goal of this supplement is to evaluate racial and ethnic differences in the quality of care received for older adults with dementia and competing multimorbidity care demands. We propose to use existing databases and multimorbidity combinations and patterns recently found in the parent grant. Our proposed research employs data from over 20 years of nationally-representative biennial surveys (~38,000 sampled people in the Health & Retirement Study) linked to Medicare claims. We propose two aims:  Aim 1. Determine racial and ethnic differences in receipt of preventive services among older adults with  mild or severe cognitive impairment and various multimorbidity combinations.  Aim 2. Evaluate racial and ethnic differences in potentially avoidable hospital admissions and  emergency department (ED) visits with discharge among older adults with mild or severe cognitive  impairment and various multimorbidity patterns. Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults: AD/ADRD-Focused  Administrative Supplement Narrative Our findings will inform policies and programs that seek to delay and avert costly and intensive levels of care among racially/ethnically diverse older adults with dementia. By identifying disease combinations with dementia associated with poor uptake of preventive services and high use of preventable hospital and emergency department services, future work can inform treatment decision-making and practice guidelines that are better attuned to the needs of vulnerable older adults with mild and severe cognitive decline.",Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults (AD/ADRD-Focused Administrative Supplement),9716886,R01AG055681,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Departments', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Institutionalization', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preventive service', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Surveys', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic diversity', 'health care service utilization', 'health related quality of life', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'parent grant', 'premature', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'racial diversity', 'sex', 'social', 'tool', 'trend', 'uptake']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,373593,-0.033781085980170864
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,9427555,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'defined contribution', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'effective intervention', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'response', 'risk variant', 'success', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,395000,-0.004929970893086266
"Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment Diagnosis-based risk adjustment is widely used in the US and abroad for health plan payment, notably for Medicare Parts C and D, for commercial contracting and quality assessment, and in numerous state Medicaid programs. Yet the risk adjustment technology used for payments has not kept up with improved classification systems, larger patient datasets, improved estimation algorithms or recent theoretical and clinical developments. Our work will take advantage of the richer ICD-10-CM classification system, in use since October 2015, with over 5 times as many diagnoses as ICD-9-CM Codes. ICD-10 codes now recognize: left vs. right side for thousands of conditions, distinguish between initial, subsequent and sequela diagnoses, and incorporate hundreds of new clinical, demographic and biometric variables. Based on the ICD-10, more exact models can leverage increased diagnostic coding accuracy to reduce opportunities for gaming or discriminating against patients with conditions who are predicted to be unprofitable. Led by two of the three developers of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS-HCC) existing classification system, our team of physicians, public policy experts, statisticians and economists will comprehensively improve the accuracy of risk adjustment and predictive models using larger sample sizes, clinical judgment and state-of-art economic and statistical modeling. We will also expand the conventional regression methods explored, to include machine learning algorithms, constrained regression, and LASSO estimation. We will calculate a new “appropriateness to include” (ATI) score that captures diagnostic vagueness, discretion and suitability for use in risk adjustment models, and use this score to inform which variables are included in plan payment formulas. Selection incentives remain of concern in public US health plan payments formulas and may be costing Medicare over $5 billion per year (NBER 2017). Prediction and payment models from this project can reduce overpayment and offset plan incentives to skimp on services that attract sick people. To ensure that these models and formulas are useful for enrollees of all ages, they will initially be calibrated and tested on large commercially-insured claims data, covering ages 0 to 64. They will then be validated and refined for Medicare, Medicaid, and state employees using data from All-Payer Claims Data from five states and a second large commercial dataset. We will make development steps, statistical programs, and full details of the classification system and prediction formulas publicly available for comment, refinement, and use by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers. Project Narrative This project will develop new classification systems and new prediction and payment models that take advantage of the fivefold increase in diagnostic codes available with the October 2015 change from ICD- 9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Using data from two national claims datasets and five state all-payer claims datasets that collectively cover over 75 million enrollees, we will identify new, underutilized ICD-10 capabilities, create new clusters of diagnoses useful for prediction, develop new algorithms for using these clusters, and estimate formulas that predict spending, utilization and diverse health care outcomes for all ages. Methods and results will be publicly described and software posted on the web for use in risk adjustment and diverse clinical, financial, policy evaluation, and quality assessment outcomes by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers.",Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment,9644117,R01HS026485,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2018,397399,0.0017064854753332304
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry. This research is expected to impact the clinical management of AAA disease, as well as the pre-surgical planning capabilities of vascular and endovascular aneurysm repair.",Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,9463479,R01HL121293,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Aneurysm', 'Award', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pressure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'recruit', 'repaired', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2018,398926,0.0010011231029669271
"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions.

"The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease Project Summary/Abstract This is a first R01 application from an early stage, new investigator and current NIEHS K01 awardee. Parkinson disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. Years before the diagnosis of PD and the onset of motor symptoms, PD patients develop non-motor symptoms, including, importantly, constipation and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Constipation affects over 80% of PD patients and is one of the strongest risk factors for PD. Recent research shows that the enteric nervous system in the gut and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve which anatomically links the GI system to the brain, are among the first and most severely affected by alpha-synuclein pathology characteristic of PD5 leading to the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal tract might be the site of initiation of PD. We propose to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the relation between human gut microbiome and PD, focusing on the pre- onset microbiome. We will do this by building on an ongoing Department of Defense funded project that has identified participants with pre-parkinson syndrome (PPS - defined as the co- occurrence of constipation, pRBD (probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder) and hyposmia) that in a pilot study has been associated with a ~200 fold increase in PD risk. Studying the microbiome among this group, who are highly likely to develop PD or are already in the premotor state, will give us a unique look at the microbiome in PD patients prior to any potential disease-associated effects of changes in diet and lifestyle that may have confounded prior case-control studies. The proposed study will take advantage of 25 years of prospectively collected data on environmental and dietary exposures and disease outcomes in two prospective cohorts of men and women. Project Narrative Our appreciation of the impact of the gut microbiome on brain health, and especially PD, is in the early stages. This study will be the first to examine the gut microbiome in participants with premotor PD and compare it to healthy controls, controls with constipation and to recently onset PD cases. This project will thus advance our understanding of how the human gut microbiome contributes to the pathophysiology of PD and will contribute to the development of tools needed for a preclinical diagnosis and/or treatment.",The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease,9343057,R01NS097723,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Bacteria', 'Biometry', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Butyrates', 'Caffeine', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Constipation', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Department of Defense', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Enteric Nervous System', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Onset of illness', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteobacteria', 'REM Sleep Behavior Disorder', 'Ralstonia', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Update', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Woman', 'alpha synuclein', 'brain health', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'dorsal motor nucleus', 'dysbiosis', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'hyposmia', 'illness length', 'men', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota profiles', 'motor symptom', 'non-motor symptom', 'posture instability', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'stool sample', 'tool development']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2018,418825,-0.015869270270485326
"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.

"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,9534365,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2018,449751,0.021406191647948748
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes.

"A software tool for objective identification of concussion-related vision disorders using a novel eye-tracking device ABSTRACT This project will create the first objective measurement tool, the VisBox, for the vision subtype of concussion (VSC). This will enable physicians to identify VSC without an eye-care professional, for referral to a vision specialist for personalized vision therapy recommendations. The persistence of concussion symptoms beyond several weeks is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, and children are particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties. A lack of accessible, objective vision diagnostics are critical barriers to identification of VSC and referral for treatment. The VisBox will be a software product that is used with the OcuTracker, Oculogica’s proprietary eye-tracking hardware platform. The VisBox will input eye movement measurements from the OcuTracker, calculate metrics that correspond to aspects of cranial nerve function affected during a concussion, and use those metrics to calculate a score to predict VSC using an algorithm developed with guided machine learning in the course of this study. The VisBox will be used by non- vision specialists to objectively measure three vision disorders related to concussion: convergence insufficiency (CI), accommodative insufficiency (AI), and saccadic dysfunction (SD) in under 4 minutes, during the clinical visit where the concussion is diagnosed. The long-term goal is to develop an objective assessment of vision characteristics, that will enable physicians that are non-specialists in vision to 1) screen for concussion-related vision disorders; 2) identify VSC; 3) make decisions about the necessity of a referral for a comprehensive vision examination; 4) monitor the effectiveness of vision treatment. Phase I Hypothesis. VisBox can produce an output score that correlates with the presence or absence of TBI- related vision disorder, i.e., VSC, by leveraging the OcuTracker visual stimulus and eye tracking system. Specific Aim I. Generate OcuTracker eye tracking data and the diagnosis of TBI-related vision disorder in 250 pediatric concussion patients. Specific Aim II. Develop and validate VisBox algorithm for assessing CI, AI, and SD using OcuTracker data. Plans for Phase II. The VisBox score will be used to predict responsiveness to vision therapy in a prospective randomized clinical study. Phase II will be a multi-armed study comparing vision therapy with placebo therapy in concussion patients and assessing whether the VisBox software can predict which patients are responsive to vision therapy. Commercial Opportunity. VisBox customers are non-eye care specialists including neurologists, pediatricians, emergency room physicians, sports medicine physicians, and concussion specialists. The total addressable market is $400M, assuming 4M annual scans at $100/scan needed for concussions in the US. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT At least 4 million concussions occur in the US each year, and up to 30% of these injuries persist beyond 4 weeks in a condition known as persistent post-concussion symptoms, which is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, with children particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties – with often serious consequences. The lack of an accessible, objective vision diagnostics presents a critical barrier to identification of the vision disorder concussion sub-type (VSC) and referral for treatment. The proposed technology will be the first objective tool that can be used by non-vision-specialists to identify concussion-related vision symptoms that is accessible to a broad range of facilities and will enable non-specialist physicians the ability to refer patients to concussion specialists to improve outcomes, decrease the time it takes patients to return to work or play, and reduce healthcare costs associated with this debilitating condition.",A software tool for objective identification of concussion-related vision disorders using a novel eye-tracking device,9465330,R41NS103698,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Brain Concussion', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Convergence Insufficiency', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Fees', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Monitor', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Optometrist', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Post-Concussion Syndrome', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vision', 'Vision Disorders', 'Visit', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'chronic pain', 'commercial application', 'concussive symptom', 'disabling symptom', 'disorder subtype', 'economic impact', 'handheld equipment', 'improved outcome', 'lens', 'novel', 'patient response', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'tv watching', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,"OCULOGICA, INC.",R41,2018,503162,-0.022819817092316567
"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,9593233,R01DK116163,"['5 year old', 'Acute Diarrhea', 'Admission activity', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bangladesh', 'Beds', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'IV Fluid', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'International Unit', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Rehydration Solutions', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'international center', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2018,544336,-0.0149017524774225
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9534732,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,550853,-0.018790341596653038
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9418100,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2018,551823,0.018086127110272358
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9441869,R01NS097000,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Labyrinthine disorder', 'Learning', 'Leukocytes', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cohort', 'emergency settings', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mRNA Expression', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'release factor', 'stroke risk', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2018,560820,0.01907081065555598
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9536156,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2018,563079,-0.0076851556761404725
"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) are debilitating conditions affecting more than 5 million Americans in 2014. It is projected that 8.4 million people with be diagnosed with ADRD over the next 15 years and health care costs attributable to ADRD are projected to be more than $1.2 trillion by 2050. Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are common and often involve aggressive behavior towards family caregivers (CG) in response to unmet needs, discomfort, or frustration. BPSD frequently lead to CG seeking medication to control patient symptoms. Antipsychotic use in persons with dementia (PWD) more than doubles mortality risk. The Choosing Wisely Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics Society both recommend against prescribing antipsychotics as a first-line treatment for BPSD. Behavioral interventions such as STAR-Caregivers are efficacious first-line treatments for managing BPSD endorsed by the Administration on Aging. However, the programs have not been implemented widely – partly due to the intensity/cost of the programs and difficulty conducting outreach. No study has investigated CG willingness to reduce or discontinue antipsychotic use. We propose a Stage III clinical trial to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of STAR Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR- VTF) in which (a) training materials are delivered electronically and learning is self-directed, (b) caregivers have two in-home visits with a social worker and (c) where caregivers receive support from a social worker via secure messaging (email) within a web-based portal. We will compare outcomes in the STAR-VTF group to an attention control group (mailed material plus generic secure messages). Our specific aims are: (1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of STAR-VTF to caregivers; (2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program from the payer perspective; and (3) Test the hypotheses that (H1) caregiver participants in STAR-VTF will have lower levels of caregiver burden at 8 weeks and 6 months compared to an attention control group; and (H2) PWD participants in STAR-VTF will have lower rates of daily antipsychotic medication use at 6 months compared to attention control. We propose to recruit 100 CG-PWD dyads (50 in each arm). This will be the first study to test a low intensity, self-directed caregiver training program with secure message support from social workers. It will also be the first study to measure changes in antipsychotic medication use by PWD after CG training. The study is also innovative because it brings together leading experts in caregiver training, health information management, and care management. Third, this will be the first study to use automated data and natural language processing to identify potential caregivers in need of education/support at a time when antipsychotic medication use begins. Results of this study will inform a future multi-site trial in the Mental Health Research Network. NARRATIVE Our study evaluates the effectiveness of a caregiver outreach, training, and support program for caregivers of people with dementia who are using antipsychotic medication to manage agitation/aggression. We will conduct a randomized trial of the caregiver program compared to a control group to measure differences in caregiver burden and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication use.

"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9547370,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Drug Screening', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Prescription opioid overdose', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid abuse', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,585626,-0.013929949578023721
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9459930,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cardiovascular insufficiency', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual response', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,601883,0.019162286823354174
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9496395,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,618216,0.015321784751949518
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients.

"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9502383,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,658069,0.014085507623504934
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9678555,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,658716,0.028666112330687506
"Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma SUMMARY: In 2016, nearly 50,000 adults in the US were diagnosed with oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and nearly 10,000 died from the disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as the most common cause of oropharyngeal (OP) SCC in the US. Although concomitant chemo- and radio-therapy is the most common treatment choice in patients with advanced OP-SCC, they have substantial short- and long- term morbidity and result in increased health care costs in patients who are cured of their cancers. These patients live with sometimes disabling morbidity for many years post-treatment. For these reasons, it has been suggested that therapy in lower risk patients might be de-escalated. There is also a higher risk cohort of patients in whom treatment with chemo-radiation may be insufficient, often resulting in distant metastatic failure. As such, these patients may require intensified therapies to improve outcomes. This is an agonizing choice for patients and their doctors, however. While patients do not want to be sickened by morbid treatments, they are obviously concerned about having the best chance at cure. Unfortunately, there currently are no companion diagnostic tools to identify which HPV + OPSCC patients are at (1) low risk of recurrence such that they can be treated safely to high cure rates with de-escalated therapy; (2) higher risk of failure despite aggressive high dose chemoradiation in whom treatment intensification strategies should be studied.  Recently, we developed a quantitative histomorphometric based image risk classifier (QuHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to predict progression in HPV+ OP-SCC patients; the current version of QuHbIC has already been validated in >400 patients and found to be superior to clinical variables in outcome prediction. In this Academic-Industry Partnership we seek to further improve predictive accuracy of QuHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as promising markers of unfavorable prognosis in HPV+ OP-SCC. We also seek to create a pre-commercial QuHbIC companion diagnostic test that is ready for clinical use in risk stratification in p16+ OP-SCC. QuHbIC will be trained on >700 retrospectively identified HPV + OP-SCC whole tissue slide images with associated long term outcome data and then validated on 440 cases from randomized, controlled, multi-institutional RTOG 0129 and 0522 clinical trials.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) computational histomorphometry from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve University, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in HPV+ OPSCC from Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic and, (3) Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company that will bring quality management systems and production software standards to establish QuHbIC as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for oropharyngeal cancers. Project Relevance: In this project we propose to optimize and validate a quantitative histomorphometric-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to better risk stratify survival among p16+ (Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related) OPSCC patients. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be either ""de-escalated”, left as standard, or even potentially escalated, depending on risk status.",Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma,9543057,R01CA220581,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International Union Against Cancer', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stage Grouping', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'common treatment', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'economic need', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'pharynx squamous cell carcinoma', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,671111,-0.04156100242475811
"Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data It is a common clinical occurrence that neuroimaging scans obtained in the course of routine clinical care discover a prior brain infarction in patients with no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Indeed, epidemiologic studies indicate that silent brain infarctions (SBI) are far more common than strokes; MRI- defined SBI can be detected in ~20% of the healthy elderly. In these studies based on screened patients, the findings have been shown to be associated with subtle, typically unrecognized, deficits in physical and cognitive function. These imaging findings are also strong, independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. Despite the very high prevalence of SBI in screened populations, and their serious consequences, little is known about the significance or the appropriate management of SBI when discovered incidentally in routine care. While there is strong evidence that antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy are effective in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke, the degree to which these results apply to patients with SBI is unclear. Because patients with SBI define a population that falls in between primary and secondary stroke prevention, the approach to these patients is marked by uncertainty and practice variation, making it an ideal condition for observational comparative effectiveness research. Nonetheless, there are serious challenges for the study of SBI. As patients have no overt symptoms, recruitment into a trial can be problematic. Comparative effectiveness research on SBI, using routinely collected data and leveraging the variation in care of these patients, is impeded by the fact that there are no ICD codes for SBI, and it is generally not included in structured fields of electronic health records (EHR) as it is typically considered an incidental finding. In order to establish the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for SBI in a large, heterogeneous population, we propose to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to identify individuals with SBI through the automated review of neuroradiology reports. We have performed preliminary work to demonstrate that such an approach is feasible. We will then apply state-of-the-science observational comparative effectiveness methods in a massive database with linked EHR and claims data to examine the effectiveness of statins and antiplatelet agents in preventing future stroke and dementia. Thus, our aims are: Aim 1: We will develop NLP algorithms that can accurately identify cases of SBI and white matter disease (WMD) in two different health systems. Aim 2: We will port, refine, and validate the NLP algorithm in a large heterogeneous database including more than 600 hospitals and 6500 clinics and identify a large cohort of patients with routinely-discovered SBI and WMD. Aim 3: We will characterize the cohort with respect to age- specific prevalence of SBI, management patterns, and the risk of future stroke and dementia associated with SBI and WMD. Aim 4: We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of preventive therapies (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally-discovered SBI. The goal of this project is to improve the evidence base for the prevention of stroke in patients with “silent brain infarct”—i.e., a stroke on neuroimaging (head CT or MRI) but no clinical evidence of a stroke. We will develop a computer-based algorithm using a technology known as natural language processing that can accurately identify cases of silent brain infarction among a large population of adults on whom neuroimages have been obtained, but who are without a history of clinically-evident cerebrovascular disease. We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of medications (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally discovered and reported SBI.",Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data,9474690,R01NS102233,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'American Stroke Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Infarction', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'effectiveness research', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'repository', 'routine care', 'screening', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,681151,0.020356194093649412
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes. Narrative The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the search of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes.

"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,9463552,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'hospital readmission', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,694555,0.004457449319885521
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA).

"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9389004,R01HL126700,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Apnea', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Pulse Rates', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic health disparity', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'portability', 'post stroke', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'stroke outcome', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke trials', 'surveillance study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,734204,0.028037570847905497
"Assisted Identification and Navigation of Early Mental Health Symptoms in Youth ABSTRACT Only slightly more than half (55%) of 4-17 year olds with significant mental health difficulties receive treatment. These are often not initiated until issues are significantly impacting the child and family. Nearly half of children with known mental health disorders and up to 80% of children with sub-clinical symptoms receive no treatment. This study aims to (a) develop methods based on electronic medical records data to identify early mental health needs in children 4-17 years of age and (b) conduct a pragmatic randomized trial in two non-academic health care systems to test a mental health family navigator model to promote early access to, engagement in, and coordination of needed mental health services for children and adolescence. Phase 1 of the study would focus on the development and refinement of a natural language processing (NLP) tool to identify symptomatic 4-17 year olds with no diagnosed mental health disorder(s). The tool would identify patients with documentation of mental health symptoms or complaints in the free text of a progress note from a recent primary care or urgent care visit. Phase 2 of the study would focus on conducting a pragmatic randomized trial comparing intervention and usual care arm patients enrolled from Kaiser Permanente (KP) Washington and KP Northern California. The trial will enroll 200 patients per arm (n=400). The navigator model to be implemented and tested will include three groups based on recent visits recorded in the electronic health record. Those with: (1) a new mental health diagnosis; (2) new mental health medication ordered, no mental health diagnosis; (3) no new mental health diagnosis or medication (symptoms identified by NLP tool). The study intervention will offer 6 months of support to the family by a mental health navigator (social worker). The navigator will perform an initial needs and barriers assessment with the family around mental health services, conduct ongoing motivational interviewing around mental health care, provide up to 4 bridging psychotherapy sessions (when appropriate) via clinic-to-home video visits, help the family find and schedule with appropriate mental health providers in the community, reach out ad hoc if mental health appointments or medication refills are missed, stay in contact with the family for 6 months. The primary outcome is percentage of youth with at least 4 psychotherapy visits in the 6 months following the initial visit. The secondary outcome is the percentage of youth with >=80% medication adherence over the 6 month follow up period. We hypothesize that the intervention arm will have higher rates of psychotherapy use and medication adherence compared to the control arm. We will also assess medication adjustments, initiation of psychotherapy or medications, and (intervention arm only) change in self-efficacy in navigating the mental health care system over 6 months.

"Electronic Health Record Data and Predictive Analytic Methods for HF The goal of this proposal is to develop accurate, generalizable and interpretable predictive models based on electronic health records (EHR) that detect heart failure (HF) in primary care patients one to two years before a clinical diagnosis and to translate the models for use in clinical care. Case-control datasets from two large US health systems (i.e., >13,000 incident HF cases and >120,000 controls) will be created and used to address two of the three study aims. For Aim 1 (Improve prediction of pre-diagnostic HF and model generalizability), recursive neural network (RNN) models will be used to improve prediction accuracy when compared to prior work that was based on traditional machine learning models (e.g., random forest, lasso logistic regression). It is expected that RNN models will perform better because temporality of EHR events can be captured. Aim 1 will also focus on improving model generalizability (i.e., among patients within and across health systems) by leveraging RNN models and by addressing challenges caused by variation in patient level EHR data (e.g., density of data) that are independent of a patient's actual health status. Aim 2 (Identify and clinically validate pre-diagnostic HF phenotypes) will focus on the identification of pre-diagnostic HF phenotypes and the use of content from RNN models derived under Aim 1. Three levels of analysis will be completed. First, we will focus on pathophysiologic heterogeneity that is represented, in part, by HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). But, HFpEF is considered to be more heterogeneous than HFrEF. New methods will be developed to reliably identify pre-diagnostic HF phenotypes. Second, phenotypes will be clinically validated for reliability and coherence and compared to clinical judgement based on a review of the patient's record. Third, we will address a challenge with RNN models, as they generate “black box” solutions that are seemingly uninterpretable. We propose to develop new methods to extract and represent the content from RNN models. We hypothesize that when phenotype status is combined with information extracted from Aim 1 RNN models it will be judged by expert clinician reviews to be superior for prevention care to phenotype status when it is combined with information extracted from traditional machine learning models or to a direct review of the patient's EHR. Finally, we will prospectively validate the phenotype and RNN models using a large primary care cohort being created by Sutter and related serial biobanked blood samples. For aim 3 we will determine how accurately the models predict elevated biomarker levels that are known to be sensitive and specific indicators of HF disease progression.   The proposed research will contribute valuable knowledge that will assist doctors to identify patients who are at high-risk of incident heart failure 12 to 24 months before the actual diagnosis and that exceed what is possible when relying on traditional signs, symptoms or risk factors. Doctors will be able to provide a more targeted approach to reduce the future risk of heart failure and the risks of morbidity and accelerated mortality that high risk patients face. Moreover, the methods that are developed for the early detection of heart failure in this study will help other researchers in creating more accurate and generalizable predictive models when using electronic health records data and when applying these models for use in clinical care.  ",Electronic Health Record Data and Predictive Analytic Methods for HF,9779100,R56HL116832,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Face', 'Feeds', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle Cells', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Stretching', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Troponin T', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'density', 'expectation', 'feeding', 'forest', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'recursive neural network']",NHLBI,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R56,2018,761303,0.01758124316157161
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9442890,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,794994,-0.00949588252319996
"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9558429,R44AG059458,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applied Research', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fire - disasters', 'Floods', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Genes', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Redwood', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'caregiver interventions', 'community setting', 'dementia caregiving', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'emotional behavior', 'flexibility', 'hazard', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'loved ones', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'social media', 'software systems', 'theories', 'user-friendly']",NIA,PEOPLE POWER COMPANY,R44,2018,825561,-0.008985740036898325
"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. AC decision-making has become more complex in recent years with the introduction of several target specific oral AC agents. It remains challenging to advise older AF patients about AC since they are frequently at high risk for stroke and complications from AC, particularly bleeding, and data are limited on real-world outcomes of AC among vulnerable populations. Our project, Detecting bleeding Events using Electronic records for Prediction in Atrial Fibrillation (DEEP AF), will leverage novel biomedical natural language processing (NLP) approaches to integrate bleeding-related information from both the structured and unstructured EHR records and statistical and deep learning approaches to predict risk of bleeding on AF patients on AC therapy. DEEP AF will address present knowledge gaps to accurately identify bleeding events from longitudinal electronic health records and to improve bleeding prediction accuracy and focus on modifiable, clinically relevant risk factors, thereby facilitating future large-scale comparative effectiveness studies evaluating AC agents, and helping clinicians develop better approaches to weighing AC risks and benefits.

"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans.1 Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers.

"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",9505972,R01HL127028,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anthropometry', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular Abnormalities', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dyspnea', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise stress test', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Galectin 3', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Renal function', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Spirometry', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'aged', 'arterial stiffness', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'exercise intolerance', 'fasting glucose', 'fitness', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'longitudinal analysis', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'screening', 'statistics', 'trend']",NHLBI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,1319272,0.012852903528924221
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9455467,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2018,2212889,-0.04997221324951173
"Variation in Surgeon-Level Intraoperative Costs: An Intervention Study Project Summary The growth of national health care expenditures is unsustainable, reaching a staggering $2.9 trillion in 2013 (8). Surgical expenditures are estimated to account for 29% of costs and consume 1/14th of our nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025 (2, 3). Time in the operating room is extremely costly, with estimates as high as $100 per minute(4). Surgical supplies alone represent up to 50% of operating room expenses(14). Historically, there has been little incentive to contain costs, but with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), reimbursements are now linked to a diagnosis or a procedure, rather than individual components of a patient's care(10). This shifts the burden of reducing expenses to health care providers who must now deliver high quality care on a fixed income. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), in particular, has an interest in evaluating, optimizing, and delivering valuable healthcare under this new framework. Surgeons have a direct impact on the cost of a patient's care as they pre-select items used for cases and open additional instruments as the operation progresses. It is common for a single surgical implant to cost thousands of dollars. Despite this, research describing intraoperative expenses is rare (16). This proposal seeks to remedy this information gap by (I) calculating surgeon-specific intraoperative costs for common general surgery operations across several academic hospitals, (II) identifying factors that drive these expenses, and (III) developing and implementing an intervention aimed to reduce these expenses. This project will retrospectively analyze electronic medical record (EMR) and hospital accounting data to determine average surgeon-expenditures for several common operations across multiple institutions. Multiple logistic regression analysis will identify the impact of patient and surgeon factors on costs. Semi-structured interviews of focus groups will shape development of the intervention. This will be followed by a six-month implementation phase and prospective analysis of the intervention's efficacy and feasibility. Results of this study will inform hospitals and health care systems about the relative costs of items used in their operating rooms and the factors driving these expenses. Importantly, it will introduce a methodology for institutions to analyze their own expenses and provide a generalizable, structured intervention that can be adapted for their use. Project Narrative There is growing pressure nationally, including from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), for critical assessments of the value provided by healthcare organizations. This proposal seeks to understand the costs of providing surgical care, specifically, the costs of surgical supplies for general surgery operations, which reflect a large but mutable component of expenditures. Further, this proposal seeks to introduce and evaluate a prospective intervention to reduce these expenses, the results of which will inform hospitals and providers about mechanisms they can use to reduce costs.",Variation in Surgeon-Level Intraoperative Costs: An Intervention Study,9402737,F32HS025079,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F32,2017,711,0.01911110460599166
"MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures Abstract: The ability to prioritize individuals for health care based on behavioral and acoustic patterns in speech will allow for efficient use of health care resources. The ability to predict mood states using daily monitoring of acoustics derived from mobile technology provides the basis for a real-time proxy measure of moods and affective states. Identification and monitoring of these and other dimensional features of human disease is the base for anticipating outcomes, offering the future possibility of timely and mitigating interventions. Technological and mHealth methods are well suited for the global health community due to the flexibility and adaptability of the approach; the capacity to reach large numbers of patients can be easily amplified with modest increase in infrastructure. We have developed an accurate prediction model for mood states in bipolar (BP) individuals using machine-learning strategies and established a process that involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and an integrated data analysis of clinical and acoustic data gathered from personal use of a mobile device for up to one year. The results show mood states are predicted with an AUC statistic of 0.74 (mania) and 0.77 (depression). We hypothesize that analyses across cultures will identify common features of illness that can be identified using our methods. BP is ideal for study because of the wide range of mood states and temperamental traits. This study aims to 1) ascertain 30 individuals with BP and 10 healthy controls from Lebanon and a multilingual community in SE Michigan, recording daily acoustic and behavioral data using a smart-phone, all outgoing speech from the device is gathered and all personal digital activity is recorded from the device. We propose to study participants in Lebanon and SE Michigan in order to identify the fundamental acoustic elements of mood variation among bipolar patients. 2) apply integrated computational analyses using static (Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling of categorical, dimensional and derived features from clinical, acoustic, and behavioral signals; we will compare data from the 15 BP from Lebanon and 15 BP from SE Michigan that have been resident in USA >2 years but originate from a geographical region comparable to Lebanon in language and culture, and 15 American born BP Caucasians (from our current cohort). Our hypothesis is that there are fundamental elements of acoustics that associate with mood states regardless of the culture. The impact is the longitudinal use of mobile technology to passively gather personal data to establish computational models that use extensive individual state and trait data to accurately predict mood and health states. This provides a foundation for predictive modeling that can be integrated into subsequent clinical interventional studies to predict and test causal effects of specific interventions on disease mechanisms. Expertise in clinical, computational, and technology disciplines form the team to realize these goals. This is a study that focuses on the ability of technological methods to detect speech and behavioral patterns in patients with bipolar disorder across cultural boundaries to identify common features that predict mood states. The overall goal is to use computational methods for the early detection of affect and mood changes that will provide the opportunity to monitor mood disorders using common methods regardless of cultural differences.",MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures,9340389,R21MH114835,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'American', 'Arabs', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Immigrant', 'Immigration', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lebanon', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multilingualism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data management', 'design', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'health data', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'markov model', 'mobile computing', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2017,30000,-0.08063091439078185
"Infection Control Implications of Heterogeneous Resistance Mechanisms in Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) PROJECT SUMMARY In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assigned its highest antibiotic resistance threat level to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). CRE are resistant to nearly all routinely used antibiotics with gram-negative coverage and have been implicated in several high-profile nosocomial outbreaks in United States (U.S.) facilities. Although in past outbreaks institutions have deployed aggressive and highly bundled responses, this “kitchen sink” approach is unlikely to be resource- or cost-effective as CRE become endemic in the U.S. Evidence-based CRE policies are necessary, but fundamental gaps in knowledge remain. In particular, heterogeneous mechanisms encode carbapenem resistance in CRE, which are broadly classifiable by whether carbapenem resistance does (“CP-CRE”) or does not (“non-CP-CRE”) arise from carbapenemase production. Until recently resistance testing was limited in clinical settings, but this landscape is changing with the rollout of commercially available assays for identifying carbapenemase production. However, data on the prevalence of CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE in U.S. patients, especially among high-risk hospitalized populations, are limited. Moreover, some evidence suggests that propensity for intra-facility spread differs between CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE, but rigorous data are lacking. Evaluating epidemiological differences in CRE resistance types is essential to establishing public health priorities for CRE prevention in U.S. healthcare facilities. Aim 1 will evaluate the prevalence of and pre-admission risk factors for rectal colonization with CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE in a cohort of approximately 1900 patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and comprehensive transplant unit (CTU) at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Risk factors will be analyzed with machine learning methodologies in order to develop a user-friendly decision tree to identify patients at high-risk of CP-CRE and/or non-CP-CRE carriage for future targeted surveillance screening. Aim 2 will utilize serially collected rectal swabs, in conjunction with clinical and environmental data, to estimate the incidence of nosocomial CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE colonization and to evaluate the contribution of asymptomatic CRE carriers and individual-level risk factors on a patient's risk of CRE acquisition during unit hospitalization. Strain-typing and other analyses as needed (e.g., whole genome sequencing) will be available to ascertain transmission events. This will be the first study in a U.S. hospital to investigate CRE spread associated exclusively with asymptomatic carriers and stratified by resistance type in a non-outbreak setting. The broad, long-term goals of this proposal are to advance our understanding of the epidemiology of CRE colonization and the implications of CRE resistance mechanisms to routes of nosocomial acquisition in order to guide CRE control policies and resource prioritization in U.S. healthcare facilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heterogeneous mechanisms encode carbapenem resistance in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Understanding the infection control implications of this heterogeneity has assumed newfound relevance with the rollout of resistance mechanism assays to identify carbapenemase production. The proposed research seeks to examine whether risk factors for CRE colonization and propensity for organism spread in the hospital environment differ by CRE resistance type, in order to promote evidence-based strategies for CRE control in U.S. hospitals.",Infection Control Implications of Heterogeneous Resistance Mechanisms in Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE),9267654,R36HS025089,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R36,2017,41785,-0.001995911597861244

"Examination of Readmissions after Cardiac Surgery in Pennsylvania: Development of Risk Models with Clinical Relevance The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) initiated policies meant to improve this period of care in an effort to encourage health care providers to engage in better coordination of care. In 2012, CMS began to assess penalties from “excess” rehospitalization for selected diagnoses, including pneumonia, heart failure, and acute myocardial infarction. The financial incentive spurred hospitals to identify patients at risk and to devise strategies to reduce readmissions. Readmissions decreased.2 Given the program's apparent success, the list of admission diagnoses was expanded to include total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 2015, and readmission after coronary artery bypass grafting was added beginning in 2017. The largest, most reliable studies of rehospitalization after cardiac surgery describe a rate of thirty day readmission of 13-19%.3-5 281,000 cardiac surgeries were reported to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database last year.6 A conservative estimate of the number of readmissions after heart surgery is therefore approximately 40,000. Multiple publications have developed logistic regression models designed to identify patients who are at increased risk of readmission, but these models have had disappointing predictive value, with c-statistics that range from 0.6 to 0.65.3-5, 8 Using data from the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council, we seek to improve upon these models.  The most common causes of readmission after heart surgery are heart failure, arrhythmia and infection. A recent publication from a consortium of academic centers described that these three diagnoses represented about half of all readmissions within 30 days.7 Identifying patients who are at high risk for cause-specific readmissions would facilitate tailored interventions to prevent this unwanted outcome. We seek to develop models that predict cause- specific readmissions and to define high-risk populations in whom targeted strategies to prevent readmission can be efficiently implemented. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that a diagnosis-specific multivariable analysis will yield models that are more predictive and can better define a high risk population.  Development of cause-specific readmission models would be a step forward in confronting this problem. These tools would aid hospitals and healthcare systems in implementing strategies to improve rates of readmission. Readmission to an acute care facility after cardiac surgery is an important clinical problem; it is estimated that 40,000 patients are readmitted within thirty days each year, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid will begin penalizing hospitals for excess readmissions after coronary artery bypass graft surgery beginning in 2017. A better understanding of the characteristics of patients who face a high risk of readmission is imperative to implement targeted transitional care strategies to prevent unnecessary readmission. Development of cause-specific readmission models would be a step forward in confronting this problem.",Examination of Readmissions after Cardiac Surgery in Pennsylvania: Development of Risk Models with Clinical Relevance,9387177,R03HS025038,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R03,2017,99609,0.016887949042834655
"Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry. Project Summary Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care are national priorities. There is growing evidence that such disparities extend to the care of children. Our overall goals are to Detect, Understand, and Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the emergency care of children. Through this proposal we will have the capacity to utilize the AHRQ funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry, a comprehensive clinical registry of all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits from 7 EDs to detect racial and ethnic disparities in the management of children seeking care in the ED. Once we detect the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in health care provision, we can then seek to understand why such disparities exist, which can then inform interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity. Through rigorous evaluation and use of multicenter comprehensive clinical data, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of pediatric emergency care. Project Narrative Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of health services is a national priority. Since the emergency department (ED) is universally available for all children to access care, it is critically important to determine whether pediatric care in EDs is being delivered equitably. With this proposal, we intend to utilize the PECARN Registry, a large registry that contains comprehensive clinical data from all pediatric ED visits made to 7 EDs, to detect whether racial and ethnic disparities exist in health care delivery for children seeking care in the ED.

"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9312144,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2017,130380,-0.0008071317812433588
"Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder As many as 53% of students report experiencing depression during college, and these depressive episodes are associated with a higher frequency of academic problems, comorbidity, and suicide. Although there are effective options for treatment, the majority of individuals (>70%) do not pursue services, and even for those who do, response rates remain modest (~40-50%). As a means of increasing accessibility to treatment, internet-based interventions for depression have been developed and tested. Despite increased availability, response to internet-based interventions continues to vary substantially, and failed treatment often contributes to persistence and worsening of symptoms. Therefore, identifying individuals with a high likelihood of responding to internet-based treatment would represent a major advance and address a critical unmet need.  In recent years, promising approaches for testing the heterogeneity of the treatment effects – delineating which individuals are likely to respond to a given treatment – have been developed. However, their use for identifying predictors of treatment response in depression remains unclear. To address this unmet need, the proposed study will test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response following internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression in a large, representative college sample (Boston Consortium of Colleges and Universities which includes 7 schools). Members of the consortium have committed to screening all incoming freshmen (N = ~14,000) through a rigorous online assessment and to offer iCBT to students with elevated levels of depressive symptoms (i.e., minor or major depression). The following steps will be pursued. First, in the initial phase of the study, freshmen students from the Boston Consortium will be screened for depression through an online survey, and they also will complete web-based neurocognitive tasks probing key mechanisms underpinning depression. Depressed students will be invited to enroll in iCBT, and a predictive algorithm will be developed based on assessments across different units of analysis (i.e., clinical characteristics, neurocognitive indices) to identify iCBT responders. Second, after the development phase, an independent sample of college students will be recruited to validate the predictive algorithm. This validation phase will use clinical indicators and neurocognitive data. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data targeting key mechanisms within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) will be acquired from a subset of participants. Neural data will be integrated to determine whether they improve the predictive algorithm. Third, data across independent samples will be combined, which will increase power to refine our predictive model for both acute and sustained response. In summary, there are alarming rates of depression among college students, and only a minority of students utilize mental health services. The proposed research will personalize our approach to depression treatment, which, ultimately, will improve effectiveness and better inform mental health care across college campuses. Depression is common, recurrent, and debilitating among college students, and the majority of depressed individuals (>70%) do not pursue treatment. Internet-based interventions are effective, low-cost, and easily disseminated, and the goal of this project is to test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response to an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression. This innovative approach - which relies on an integration of data across units of analysis (e.g., self- report, neurocognitive, and neural data) – promises to optimize treatment outcomes for depression, and therefore, reduce associated negative consequences including academic problems, risky behavior engagement, and suicidality.",Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder,9328159,R56MH109566,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Boston', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'college', 'control trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'minor depressive disorder', 'minority student', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuromechanism', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'programs', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'reward expectancy', 'screening', 'suicidal behavior', 'support tools', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R56,2017,139359,-0.01610197134681202
"Rule-based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Effective Clinical Decision Support (CDS): A Pediatric Severe Sepsis Case Study using ICU Data The recognition, diagnosis, and management of sepsis remain among the greatest challenges in pediatric critical care medicine. The diagnosis of pediatric severe sepsis is particularly challenging since it is time-critical and frequently must rely on clinician interpretation of an equivocal, non-specific, age-dependent constellation of clinical signs and symptoms that occur in association with an infection or other inciting events. Currently available EMR data screening tools designed to identify pediatric severe sepsis using consensus-based guidelines criteria have poor sensitivity/specificity and/or positive predictive value that can result in poor perceived usability. Recent studies show that, in general, sepsis CDS alert fatigue is common, either in the form of false positives or false negatives (e.g. alerting focused on the most severely ill with unequivocal signs of sepsis). As a result such tools are, at best, modestly clinically effective in improving early detection of unrecognized pediatric sepsis and, in infants, can result in antibiotic administration to large numbers of uninfected newborns. We believe significant improvement in CDS usability can only be achieved with a significant improvement in sensitivity/specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) operating at a clinician-specified level of risk. This will require alerting algorithms that leverage the combined analytic power of computerized semantic models (rules, natural language processing) embodied in consensus pediatric sepsis guidelines, pediatric critical care clinician expertise, and retrospective analytics over existing large repositories of clinical encounter data using machine learning algorithms. Late last year we were awarded a SBIR Phase 1 NIH research grant focused on the use of advanced ontological models combined with “big data” predictive analytics/machine learning (ML) techniques over ICU data as a foundation for an adult sepsis CDS. We demonstrated an AUC of 98% and PPV in excess of 85% for our sepsis detection tool for a patient sample of 15,811. We will leverage these results to establish exceptionally sensitive and specific tool that monitors PICU data to accurately predict pediatric patients at risk for impending acute clinical deterioration due to severe sepsis/septic shock. Our goal is to commercially deploy highly useable technology that achieves high levels of clinician acceptance and demonstrably influences timely treatment and pediatric patient outcomes. Our product development concept will employ human factors engineering to achieve highly synchronicity with clinical workflows, combined with a clinician-centered design of the interfaces between our CDS and the institutional pediatric sepsis protocols and EMR data sources. Our product vision is an early sepsis detection CDS with actionable accuracy and usability, compatible with any modern EMR in use at a client hospital, that is effective in reducing pediatric sepsis mortality in both critical and non-critical care settings. Even with the advent of powerful computer system technologies and modern antibiotics/antivirals used in hospitals, one-third of children who die in U.S. tertiary care pediatric intensive care units have severe sepsis. The goal of this research is to develop and validate a real-time pediatric severe sepsis surveillance software system that can be routinely used in conjunction with electronic medical record systems in hospitals to detect early stages of this syndrome. Our approach uses modern artificial intelligence techniques including cognitive reasoning, machine learning and natural language processing to dramatically reduce preventable mortality in hospitalized neonates and children.",Rule-based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Effective Clinical Decision Support (CDS): A Pediatric Severe Sepsis Case Study using ICU Data,9254171,R43GM122154,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Case Study', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysuria', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newborn Infant', 'Onset of illness', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Parents', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Units', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Infant', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'adverse outcome', 'age related', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computerized', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'neonate', 'patient stratification', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'product development', 'prototype', 'repository', 'screening', 'software systems', 'symposium', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2017,147475,0.012451948857425248
"Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is defined as a severe infection with dangerous physiologic changes, organ dysfunction or death, which hospitalizes over 1.6 million people in the U.S. annually. Sepsis is a priority for the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services due to its healthcare impact, incidence and staggering annual cost, which exceed $20 billion and 5% of all U.S. hospital costs. All sepsis patients, even those with mild sepsis are at risk for in- hospital complications and death, but have improved outcomes if identified early. Sepsis recognition, however, is challenging due to the heterogeneity of patients who may manifest a wide array of clinical presentations. Electronic medical record (EMR) linked computer programs, known as clinical decision support (CDS) tools, have become ubiquitous to assist providers, including identifying sepsis patients. Unfortunately, all CDS tools in the literature miss 20-30% of sepsis patients and frequently misidentify non-sepsis patients as sepsis patients. Inaccurate CDS tools generate far too many false positive alerts, creating the dangerous condition of “alert fatigue” in which providers become habituated to all alerts, threatening patient safety and even leading to fatal consequences.  The PI and Co-I of this proposal collaboratively developed a CDS software called Sepsis-Alert for adult emergency department (ED) patients. It was fully implemented into Detroit Medical Center's (DMC) EMR live environment and has now been continually operational to provide real-time ongoing monitoring of all ED patients at Sinai Grace Hospital of DMC since October 2014. Our analysis of 25,000 ED visits reveals that while Sepsis-Alert's performance exceeds any reported performance, it still remains unacceptably inaccurate. All the CDS tools, including ours, have two limitations: (1) they lack a mechanism to learn from their past erroneous decisions and consequently repeat the same mistakes again and again, and (2) their decision- making process is fixed and treats all patients in the same way even in face of high heterogeneity of patients,  The main thrust of this research project is to develop an innovative prototype CDS software that functions like Sepsis-Alert but without the two limitations for the same ED sepsis screening purpose. We will develop the software system by utilizing data extracted from the EMR and will test and fine tune the system in over 35,000 retrospective and prospective patients at Sinai Grace Hospital. The proposed prototype, Intelligent Sepsis Alert, will have the cutting edge capabilities of recognizing the subtleties of sepsis, categorizing patients and learning from its own mistakes to avoid repeat them. CDS tools of the future can and must be better. Machine learning is the solution to optimizing patient care without creating a harmful environment. The final deliverable of this project will be a highly accurate and advanced program readily adoptable by any health system or hospital to improve sepsis care and create a safer healthcare environment. 1 Project Narrative  Sepsis is a toxic response to a severe infection and represents a healthcare epidemic, which afflicts millions of people and accounts for 5% of all hospital costs and over $20 billion in the U.S. annually. This project's objective is to develop a cutting edge computer based tool, called Intelligent Sepsis Alert, with the power of machine intelligence (a form of artificial intelligence) and the ability to learn that will accurately identify sepsis patients for healthcare providers extremely early in their hospital course to ensure that patients receive all of the necessary life-saving interventions they need. Intelligent Sepsis Alert will be readily adoptable by other hospitals and health systems and by providing the critical real-time, bedside support for early sepsis identification will translate into multitudes of deaths prevented, abundant intensive care unit admissions avoided, hundreds of thousands of dollars saved and thousands of wasted nursing and physician man-hours eliminated.",Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning,9280871,R21HS024750,[' '],AHRQ,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,149851,0.025780703235823942
"Objective Evaluation of Variation in Sepsis Incidence, Mortality, and Care PROJECT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a leading cause of death, disability, and cost to the healthcare system. Increasing recognition of the devastating burden of sepsis has prompted national performance improvement initiatives and efforts to benchmark the quality of sepsis care. However, efforts to track sepsis incidence, outcomes, and quality have been hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance tools. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has thus led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records (EHRs) using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction. He has demonstrated that this method is less susceptible to changing diagnosis and coding practices over time than administrative claims data, the traditional method of surveillance, and can be applied to diverse EHR systems in different healthcare systems. The overall goal of this proposal is to build on this work to improve the ability of researchers, clinical organizations, and policy makers to evaluate variation in sepsis incidence, outcomes, and care and thus identify targets for improvement and inform better prevention and treatment strategies. These themes fit with AHRQ's mission to improve health care quality and patient safety, and are reflected in the Specific Aims: 1) Develop and validate a disease severity prediction model for risk-adjustment of sepsis outcomes based on data routinely captured in electronic health records, 2) Evaluate interhospital and intrahospital unit-level variation in sepsis incidence and outcomes using objective EHR-data versus claims codes and identify factors associated with worse outcomes, and 3) Evaluate the impact of lactate testing on clinical outcomes in patients with suspected sepsis. This project will leverage “big data” with granular clinical information from more than 200 academic and community hospitals and 4 million inpatient encounters, providing the capacity to adjust for multiple confounders, analyze important patient subgroups, and make robust conclusions that are widely generalizable to the nation. The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, MD, MPH, is a junior faculty member in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a dual-certified critical care and infectious disease physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital. This K08 proposal will capitalize on Dr. Rhee's rich clinical background, foundational training in epidemiology, biostatistics, and public health, and previous research experience with sepsis epidemiology and surveillance using EHR clinical data. Dr. Rhee's immediate goals during this award period are to 1) acquire skills in using “big data” in healthcare and handling missing data, 2) learn advanced methods in prediction modeling and mixed-effects logistic regression, 3) learn propensity score analysis and comparative effectiveness research skills, 4) improve communication, research leadership, and grant writing skills, and 5) participate in ongoing training in ethical research conduct. These goals will be accomplished through a combination of active mentoring; formal didactic coursework; immersive research training; practical experience; and collaborations with internationally recognized sepsis and infectious disease experts, public health officials, and the Hospital Corporation of America, the largest inpatient private healthcare system in the world. Throughout the K08 award period, he will continue to establish himself as a national thought leader on sepsis epidemiology, surveillance, and quality while preparing for his transition to independence. Dr. Rhee's multidisciplinary and experienced mentorship team, combined with the superb research environment of the Harvard Medical School Department of Population Medicine, provides the support and training experience necessary to achieve his long-term goal of becoming an independently funded health services researcher focusing on using big data to improve disease surveillance, prevention, and quality of care for sepsis and infections in critically ill patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE   The devastating burden of sepsis on our society has prompted national performance improvement initiatives, but efforts to measure sepsis rates, outcomes, and quality of care are hindered by the lack of reliable surveillance methods.  The candidate, Dr. Chanu Rhee, has led recent efforts to develop a novel method for identifying sepsis through electronic health records using objective clinical markers of infection and concurrent organ dysfunction rather than administrative claims codes, which are prone to variability in diagnosis and coding practices and changing billing incentives over time. The overall goal of this proposal is to build on this work and improve the capacity of researchers, clinical organizations, and policy makers to evaluate variation in sepsis incidence, outcomes, and care patterns across hospitals using electronic health record data, and thus identify targets for improvement and inform better sepsis prevention and treatment strategies.  ","Objective Evaluation of Variation in Sepsis Incidence, Mortality, and Care",9385491,K08HS025008,[' '],AHRQ,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",K08,2017,151416,0.02471502320093044
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9279027,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'CCL26 gene', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Standardization', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'illness length', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2017,156324,-0.019878059715930322
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9353310,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2017,157988,0.014082200190296839
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy.

"Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place SUMMARY This proposal is for an NLM sponsored K01 Mentored Career Development Award. The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention. The objective of this application is to map data collected from physiological sensors with the behavior patterns of persons with dementia, as well as the caregiver to understand the physiological changes associated with behavior changes to facilitate early intervention through timely alerts to clinicians.",Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place,9339726,K01LM012439,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Community Health', 'Couples', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instructor', 'instrument', 'learned behavior', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile application', 'multisensory', 'primary caregiver', 'professor', 'programs', 'rehabilitation technology', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'support tools', 'trait', 'usability', 'web app']",NLM,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,170236,-0.015430851300845405
"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization. Given the rapidly rising numbers of patients with dementia, reducing potentially preventable hospitalization could have an enormous impact on public health.",Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms,9291398,K08AG048321,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Assessment tool', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Bioinformatics', 'Capsicum', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Community Psychiatry', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'International', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kale - dietary', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Rural', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleeplessness', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'behavior change', 'career', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'geriatric mental health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'medication compliance', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2017,175103,0.0023460273896311794
"Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill Thrombocytopenia is extremely frequent in critically ill patients. However, the role of acute platelet responses in critically ill patients is not well studied, and the multifactorial etiology of thrombocytopenia in the ICU makes it difficult to understand, or understand whether or not to treat it. In several situations such as traumatic injury or sepsis, very low platelet counts have been to bleeding, thrombosis and end-organ injury. Platelets have been extensively studied as a key component of hemostasis, but a rapidly emerging concept is that platelets are also key effector cells in systemic inflammatory processes as both instigators of local and systemic inflammatory reactions and also participants in the inflammation that contributes to tissue injury. The link between platelets and inflammation is complex and bidirectional, as inflammatory ligands have been shown to regulate platelet function and activated platelets induce inflammatory responses in other cell types. The overarching theme of this proposal is to study platelet dynamics in critically ill patients, construct clinical endotypes of thrombocytopenia in this population, and to relate these endotypes to underlying mesoscale mechanisms through computational modeling. We will use a large electronic health record-based database and a tri-state trauma database as source data to construct these endotypes. We define endotype as clinical patterns defined along four dimensions: (1) baseline information (demographic, chronic disease burden, severity of illness and admitting diagnosis), (2) features of the platelet count time series (rate of decrease, nadir, etc.), (3) concurrent interventions, and (4) outcome. The computational approach will attempt to root clinical endotypes in mechanistic interpretations (or collections of alternative interpretations), contributing to focus basic science investiagtions, and to close key knowledge gaps preventing the design and use of targeted anti-platelet-inflammatory therapies in the critically ill. Computational models will be developed at different levels of complexity, with a specific attention to tie underlying mechanisms to functional assays routinely performed in thrombocytopenic patients, such as prothrombin time, activated coagulation time, and thromboelastogram. Platelets is a blood component playing a central role in coagulation and the inflammatory response. A low platelet counts is seen extremely often in acutely ill patients. This proposal will use large databases to find patterns associated with low platelets, how decreasing or low platelet counts are associated with disease and outcome, and use computer model to link the time evolution of platelet counts to mechanisms of disease. Hopefully, the research will lead to more focused therapeutic approaches targeting platelets in critically ill patients.",Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill,9307982,R21HL133891,"['Acute', 'Acute Lung Injury', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Factor', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Effector Cell', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prothrombin time assay', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'attenuation', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'design', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2017,180249,-0.0030994309682802583
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9322197,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,190216,0.02878273063571022
"Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) affects ~1.5 million persons annually in the United States with fifteen to 30% of patients suffering long-term disability after injury. We remain in the early phase of understanding this disease and one of the greatest barriers to studying the disease and developing appropriate therapy is the difficulty in diagnosis and outcome prediction. Generally, the diagnosis of MTBI relies on using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a 15-point gross measurement of eye-opening, motor and verbal response. The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) workshop in 2014 indicated that use of GCS score as a single classifier for TBI is insufficient and proposed that neuroimaging play a larger role towards the development of objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. We have specific experience in studying novel MRI techniques that show much promise in evaluating MTBI patients. The goal of the current proposal is to bring these novel MRI techniques to clinical use. We propose to combine information from objective MR imaging features with clinical information to learn the patterns that can best distinguish patients from controls and predict long-term outcome using machine learning. We will validate our tool using a separate subject cohort. Such a tool would be an extremely powerful clinical tool to identify at-risk patients for early intervention. Additionally, this research will identify the most clinically relevant MR metrics, thereby pointing the way to novel therapeutic pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a major public health problem for which there is a lack of evidence-based, quantitative and objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate recent advances in MR imaging of MTBI with clinically important information using advanced machine-learning computational algorithms to identify the most clinically relevant features, thus allowing us to distinguish patients from controls and to predict clinical outcome. If successful, this research will provide an objective tool for classification and outcome prediction in MTBI and will be a critical advance in both the clinical and research arenas in the study of traumatic brain injury.",Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury,9295067,R21NS090349,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Common Data Element', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connective Tissue', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Eye', 'FarGo', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iron', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Non-linear Models', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disability', 'drug development', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'magnetic field', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood regulation', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2017,198365,-0.03004660346366954
"Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection Statement of Work There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests for the evaluation of the etiology of febrile states, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. This project will develop host-based biomarker signatures capable of identifying the presence and pathogen class of infections in vulnerable immunocompromised human subjects, thus potentially allowing for earlier, more directed (and thus more effective) therapy as well as reducing the need for potentially harmful empiric anti-infective therapy. In this study we will a) perform high dimensional gene expression analysis on existing samples of at-risk hosts with proven candidemia, viral infection, bacterial infection, or noninfectious illness, b) develop peripheral blood-based gene expression signatures of candidemia and c) generate a combined multinomial classifier capable of differentiating four clinical states: viral infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection (candidemia) and noninfectious illness. The enclosed work offers a true paradigm shift in the way febrile illnesses in this high-risk population are diagnosed and managed. Relevance Statement Timely and accurate differentiation of viral, bacterial, and fungal illness has important implications for both the individual patient and society as earlier/more accurate diagnosis may improve patient treatment and clinical outcomes as well as curb anti-microbial overusage and subsequent proliferation of resistant organisms.","Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection",9373089,R21AI132978,"['Acute', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Candida', 'Candidiasis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effector Cell', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fever', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Infectious Agent', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modality', 'Mycoses', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adjudicate', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'candidemia', 'cohort', 'evaluation/testing', 'genomic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'human subject', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'migration', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'peripheral blood', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'therapy outcome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAID,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,198750,-0.017138203057387995
"Algorithms to Identify Systemic Lupus from Electronic Health Record Data Abstract  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, multisystem disease that is often difficult to diagnose because of the diverse manifestations that occur over time and across care sites leading to increased damage and early mortality. The personal and economic costs in decreased quality of life and increase in healthcare expenditures, respectively, highlight the critical unmet need to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat lupus, so that treatment or participation in clinical trials occurs as early as possible to mitigate against disease-related damage. Therefore, it is important to find better ways to identify SLE patents.  Electronic health records (EHR) are now used in a majority of health care settings throughout the country, and present a rich source of information about patients which can be mined for earlier diagnosis and identification to improve quality of care, or enable high throughput clinical studies. Despite this potential, to date few accurate algorithms have been developed to identify SLE patients using EHR data. Construction of an effective algorithm, either by rule-based or machine learning methods, requires access to at two data resources not commonly available: 1) a validated “gold standard” patient data set with clear documentation of criteria that are indicative of SLE that can be compared against EHR data and 2) an integrated health record dataset that contains data from multiple health care institutions and reflects that SLE patients receive healthcare at multiple institutions and healthcare providers given their chronic, progressive disease. Over the past several years, our team has created both key resources: the Chicago Lupus Database (CLD), a physician-validated registry of 880 patients and gold standard data set and the Chicago HealthLNK Data Repository (HDR), a regional data resource including integrated medical records for 2.1 million patients across multiple institutions. Jointly, these two datasets enable the creation, testing and validation of algorithms for the identification of SLE in EHR data and provide a more complete picture of a patient population at risk for lupus.  We propose three specific aims to address the need to reduce the time to identify those with SLE in order to initiate treatment in a timelier fashion and to identify candidates for clinical trials. These aims are: 1) To create and validate a series of algorithms to identify SLE patients in EHR data against a gold standard curated registry, CLD, using validated classification criteria for SLE to build concepts for rule-based and machine learning methods that incorporate structured data, laboratory data, and unstructured data, e.g., physician notes, 2) To determine whether identification of SLE patients is improved when algorithms to identify SLE patients are extended to an integrated medical record dataset that includes data from multiple health care institutions, and 3) To use clustering techniques on SLE patients identified from EHR data to isolate clinically distinct sub-populations of patients, which could inform patient selection for participation in clinical trials.

"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis.

"Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Patients often have poor access to screening and vaccination, and present in advanced stages, for which chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of failure and toxicity. Although intensifying chemotherapy can improve tumor control and survival, toxicity is often unacceptably high. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoRT are therefore needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue. In contrast, image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) is a modern technique that maximizes target dose and minimizes normal tissue dose. Multiple studies have found that IG-IMRT can significantly reduce organ dose and reduce toxicity compared to standard RT. These studies support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT can permit delivery of more intensive chemotherapy. For example, gemcitabine, a potent radiosensitizer, has been found to improve survival for cervical cancer patients in randomized trials (Dueñas-Gonzalez et al.). However, the toxicity when delivered with standard RT is extreme (>80% grade 3-4 toxicity). Therefore, this regimen has not replaced cisplatin alone as the standard of care. In contrast, our research group has found that the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine was increased when given with IG-IMRT. A large international multi-institutional trial has also found lower rates of toxicity with IG-IMRT compare to standard chemoRT. These findings support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT, by reducing bowel and bone marrow dose, could permit delivery of more effective concurrent chemotherapy. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for many pelvic malignancies. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial.  CVM-1421 is an emerging NCI-funded randomized phase II trial within the NRG Oncology Cooperative Group that will test the hypothesis that adding concurrent triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, to concurrent cisplatin and RT can improve outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced cervix cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation. This trial presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of IG- IMRT on normal tissue toxicity, as it will be the first cooperative group trial to permit IG-IMRT in this population. This trial also presents an opportunity to study ways to improve IG-IMRT quality, as there has been considerable controversy in how to optimally design IG-IMRT plans, due to their increased complexity. The goal of our research is to study the effect of IG-IMRT on toxicity, quality of life, and treatment outcomes, under varying intensities of chemotherapy. We will also implement a novel technique called knowledge-based planning (KBP) in order to improve plan quality and achieve optimal IG-IMRT dose distributions. This research could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care for pelvic malignancies, and will lay groundwork for future studies testing novel technologies in clinical trial settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) will reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without triapine. We are in an optimal situation to ask this question because the randomized phase II trial that will set the background for our study is evaluating the efficacy of more intensive chemotherapy while allowing both IG-IMRT and standard radiation treatment techniques. It would be beneficial for clinicians and patients to know whether IG-IMRT will reduce toxicity and improve quality of life. Further, this study could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care.",Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421,9301295,R01CA197059,"['American', 'Anterior', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic', 'Gynecology', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Population', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitor', 'Secondary to', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'gastrointestinal', 'gemcitabine', 'image guided', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'new technology', 'novel', 'oncology', 'phase I trial', 'phase II trial', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiation effect', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,217388,-0.026181322934763676
"Enabling value-based healthcare through automating risk assessment for episode-based care Project Summary Value-based healthcare implementation relies on understanding risk. 1 Early models, such as Medicare Advantage, use annual measures of risk under a risk adjustment factor (RAF) to offer financial incentive to payers and hospitals to work together. 2 More advanced models, such as bundled payments, target the periods of greatest quality variability, specifically episodes of care such as joint replacement, oncology diagnosis, and cardiac procedures. In these episodes, many types of providers, from hospitals to outpatient physical therapists, need to work together to reduce rates of complication and readmission. Risk levels are used to adjust payment for payer and providers and to determine which patients require additional resources in the hospital, clinic, or home. Unfortunately, existing risk models lack key features needed for episode-based care, which requires both financial alignment and accurate and immediate information to adjust clinical resources for a given case. 3 4 A better model would include all conditions relevant to an episode rather than just chronic conditions, addition of social determinants, and an automated approach to retrieve the information in hours rather than months. Thus, this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I program includes the following Specific Aims: 1. Create the phenotyping components required to define an accurate and comprehensive model  of episode-based risk, including: (i) extract clinical and social features from clinical data using  natural language processing (NLP), (ii) map concepts including social features to an ontology  that will support normalized data use, (iii) build a feature vector for each record that can be  used to feed a risk model that accounts for relevant clinical and social risk 2. Validate the phenotyping components using de-identified longitudinal clinical data for 10,000 patients In this research program, Phase I will tackle the most difficult challenges, including leveraging narrative text to recognize time-labeled social and clinical features influencing an episode of care. Success criteria will be accurate recognition of key underlying features that have not been available in risk models to date. Phase II will build upon the validated technology to create an episode-based risk model run on narrative and discrete clinical data and tested against actual patient outcomes. Success criteria will be a validated episode-based risk model to support value-based contracting and value-based clinical care. Project Narrative Advanced payment models in United States healthcare rely on accurate assessment of risk and quality. While quality has gained broad attention, risk models remain outdated and poorly suited to advanced payment models. CapsicoHealth proposes an effort to redefine risk models used for episode-based payments, using data sets across the continuum of care and clinical and social determinants of care that have previously been unavailable in computable form. If successful, this effort will impact financial and clinical approaches to value-based healthcare and significantly increase the chance that national efforts to improve cost and quality will be effective.",Enabling value-based healthcare through automating risk assessment for episode-based care,9464424,R43LM012798,"['Attention', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complication', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Contracts', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Reform', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Insurance', 'Label', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'care episode', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'concept mapping', 'cost', 'feeding', 'financial incentive', 'improved', 'interest', 'oncology', 'payment', 'physical therapist', 'programs', 'social', 'success', 'vector']",NLM,"CAPSICOHEALTH, INC.",R43,2017,222588,0.0024431332133451086
"Telehealth Intervention for Improved Blood Pressure Control with Targeted Incentives: Using New Technologies and Insights From Behavioral Economics to Increase the Effectiveness of Behavioral Change PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Hypertension, or sustained systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 and 90 mm Hg or higher, is among the most frequently encountered conditions in primary care in the U.S. The estimated prevalence is 30% among all U.S. adults and increases with age to affect 65% of seniors. Hypertension is also the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, global mortality, and ranks third among the causes of disability. Treatment of hypertension is relatively straightforward, but patient adherence to long- term self-care strategies is problematically low. Three important behaviors that individuals can adhere to in order to help lower their BP are 1) Taking medications as prescribed by a physician, 2) Monitoring blood pressure at home, and 3) Limiting dietary sodium intake. Adherence to these behaviors is problematic and currently ranges from 25% to 50%; the current proposal is aimed at addressing the behavioral barriers for these three activities with the help of new technology. In particular, this STTR will develop and test an incentive program delivered through a telehealth app to increase adherence to prescribed BP control regimens, and precipitate reduction in BP. The target participants for the test are a vulnerable population of seniors with clinically diagnosed hypertension in the University of California - San Diego community. The product to be developed through this STTR is a telehealth app for patient smartphones, which incorporates financial and targeted incentives framed in a way that targets specific “mental accounts” to maximize the behavioral effectiveness of the intervention. The approach is to (1) Using focus group to construct an optimal incentive strategy to promote adherence to overcome behavioral barriers, support self-efficacy, and complement intrinsic motivators, and (2) Demonstrate feasibility of combining behavioral economics with state-of-the-art telehealth technology to deliver an optimal incentive strategy to the specific group of patients to promote adherence and reduce BP. The telehealth innovation centers on (a) Immediate delivery of reminder triggers and reinforcement to establish behaviors, (b) Employment of computer vision and artificial intelligence technologies to reduce time and effort costs of adherence, and finally (c) Support for remote monitoring of patient progress by health plans, providers and researchers. Phase II will test the efficacy of this approach in a larger and more diverse population within the UCSD Health system, additionally incorporating incentives for outcomes (e.g., achievement of BP < 140/90 mm Hg) to search for statistically and clinically significant improvements in blood pressure resulting from use of the app with the optimal incentives. Initial customers are health insurers and risk-bearing hospital systems (e.g. those with value-based reimbursement models), who are fiscally responsible for large numbers of patients with poorly controlled BP. PROJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nonadherence to treatment for high blood pressure in the aging population is an urgent public health concern that impacts individuals, families, and communities across the nation. The resulting health problems, including cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke, and death, and excessive spending, can be relieved through enhanced remote support for behavioral change using low-cost, scalable, and widely accessible telehealth tools, such as the product of this STTR. This approach has the potential to become widely adopted by health plans and providers that care for millions of seniors with poorly controlled hypertension to help these populations avoid complications and achieve better their health, as well as contribute to a better understanding of human behaviors and their impact on medical conditions.",Telehealth Intervention for Improved Blood Pressure Control with Targeted Incentives: Using New Technologies and Insights From Behavioral Economics to Increase the Effectiveness of Behavioral Change,9345760,R41AG056184,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Dietary Sodium', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Employment', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Planning', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Home Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Salvelinus', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Sodium', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'beneficiary', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'commercial application', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'dual eligible', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'usability']",NIA,"WELLTH, INC.",R41,2017,223743,0.01007812639617701
"Comparative Effectiveness of Oral Anticoagulants in Atrial Fibrillation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia, affects >2 million Americans and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Adequate antithrombotic treatment in AF is critical to preventing stroke and other complications. To date, this has been mostly achieved with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin in the US). Warfarin use, however, is burdensome and carries a significant risk of complications. Recently, new oral anticoagulants (OACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have proved in randomized trials to be at least as efficacious as warfarin in preventing stroke in AF patients. Randomized trials, however, are not always generalizable to the usual clinical setting. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these new OACs, compared to warfarin, and to identify patients more likely to benefit from the new medications. In this application, we propose to assess the following specific aims: (1) to estimate the effectiveness of new OACs versus warfarin treatment in the prevention of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, healthcare utilization, and mortality;(2) to assess the risk of bleeding and other complications (myocardial infarction, dyspepsia) associated with use of new OACs versus warfarin in these patients; (3) to identify patient subgroups, defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and use of other medications, for which the new OACs are particularly beneficial or hazardous; and (4) to develop and validate risk predictive models of stroke / cardioembolic complications and severe hemorrhage in AF patients using new OACs. To address these research questions, we will use two large claim databases, OptumInsight and MarketScan. These databases include health insurance claims from over 1 million patients with AF, and >155,000 users of new OACs. State- of-the-art methods for comparative effectiveness research, including high-dimensional propensity scores, marginal structural models, and instrumental variables, will be used to adjust for confounding. Results from our research will provide key evidence to help patients and clinicians make decisions about their anticoagulant treatment, balancing benefits and risks associated with different therapeutic options. This proposal also has the potential to inform decisions by regulatory agencies, insurers, health system leaders, and professional organizations in issues such as post marketing approval, reimbursements, and clinical guidelines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited information exists on the ""real-world"" effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation,a common cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed research will provide timely and necessary information to help clinicians and patients make well-founded decisions on the use and choice of oral anticoagulants.

"Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults exhibit poor recovery and are at high risk for rehospitalization after acute heart failure. Current rehabilitation and clinical management strategies have shown only modest benefits because the mechanisms underlying poor outcomes remain under recognized and therefore unmitigated. The proposed study will address this critical knowledge gap by examining the role of systemic mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity as a fundamental factor underlying poor physical function in hospitalized acute decompensated heart failure, the success of rehabilitation, and the prognosis of patients following hospitalization. This will be accomplished in a highly translational and cost-effective manner as an ancillary study to REHAB-HF (R01AG045551; PI: Kitzman), a multi-center clinical trial funded by the NIA that tests the hypothesis that impaired physical function underlies adverse outcomes in older hospitalized ADHF patients and employs a novel rehabilitation program that targets multiple domains of physical function for 12 weeks beginning during hospitalization. The results of REHAB-HF can impact clinical practice; however, its outcomes do not directly address potential mechanisms of action. Mitochondrial function is likely candidate for mediating physiological decline in REHAB-HF participants, because these organelles are sensitive to a myriad of intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to aging, physical function, heart failure, and hospitalization.  Mitochondrial dysfunction across multiple tissues has been implicated in physiological decline associated with heart failure and is thought to be mediated by circulating factors that affect systemic bioenergetic capacity. Therefore, we propose that respirometric profiling of circulating cells can be used to report on systemic bioenergetic decline in heart failure patients and will be associated with physical function and long term outcomes - including rehospitalization rate. We will determine whether the REHAB-HF rehabilitation program increases bioenergetic capacity, compared to control, thereby improving functional outcomes. Bioenergetic profiling of multiple blood cell populations will enable us to identify the specific cell types and bioenergetic parameters, or patterns comprised of multiple variables, that are most closely associated with REHAB-HF outcomes such as physical function and quality of life. We will also determine the ability of blood cells to report on systemic bioenergetic decline y examining relationships with mitochondrial function measured in skeletal muscle. Successful strategies for mitigating poor physical function and improving long-term outcomes rely on the identification of mechanisms that contribute to the vulnerability of patients after discharge. Bioenergetic profiling may enable the identification of patients in need of more intensive management and targeted rehabilitation. The advancement of blood-based bioenergetic profiling will enhance the use of this promising test in future trials, and potentially, in the cliical care of older patients with the wide range of chronic medical conditions associated with physical disability and poor clinical outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will examine the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the physical function of older adults hospitalized for acute heart failure, and th long term rehabilitation outcomes of these patients. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the success of recovery will lead to improved treatment strategies that can be personalized in order to maximize benefits for individual patients. The results of this study can improve the management of older adults hospitalized with acute heart failure and will be generalizable to the broader issues of age-related bioenergetic decline and post-hospitalization syndrome.",Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure,9267094,R21AG051077,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Ancillary Study', 'Bioenergetics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise stress test', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heart failure', 'Hormones', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardium', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'exercise intolerance', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation management', 'respiratory', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2017,229328,0.012930669944241446
"Building Multistage Treatment Regimens for Depression after Acute Coronary SyndromeSyndrome Building Multistage Treatment Policy for Depression after Acute Coronary Syndrome Project Summary Depression is not only commonly observed among patients who experienced acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but also has been shown to increase risks for recurrent ACS and mortality. Despite its high prevalence and serious impact, management of post-ACS depression remains poor because of ineciencies in depression screen- ing, limited treatment options of depression after ACS, and lack of e ective procedure if initial treatment fails. To address these issues, clinical researchers have tried to develop personalized stepped care procedures for post-ACS depression patients; this involves o ering patients the choice of receiving psychotherapy and/or antidepressant treatment and adjusting treatment as needed. The treatment decisions are usually based on patient demographics, treatment preference, medical history, progress of disease, and comorbid conditions. With the development of modern technologies, the number of available treatments increases, and more pa- tient information are collected in clinical research. Thus excavating useful information for treatment decisions is becoming more challenging. In this project, we propose to develop a principled way to construct simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional data, that can be used to guide treatment selection throughout the course of the disease. Aim 1 of the project is devoted to the development of vari- able selection methodology for constructing multistage treatment policies using statistical machine learning techniques. The proposed research seeks to incorporate the popular variable selection technique (LASSO) into existing treatment policy search approaches, namely Q-learning and A-Learning, for developing optimal treatment policies and for identifying patient response status to initial treatment { an important factor for tailoring treatment in the subsequent stages. Aim 2 evaluates the proposed methods, applies the methods to post-ACS depression data, and addresses some computational challenges. Statistical research in this area has been focused on the development of evidence-based treatment policies using pre-chosen models and variables; few if any discuss how to select models or variables in a principled way. The proposed work aims to ll this gap in methodology using modern machine learning techniques. Project Narratives The proposed research aims to answer the following question:\How to excavate simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional, longitudinal medical data in a principled way?""

"Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an innovative relative risk model predicting incidence of complications in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients. Spine surgery is a rapidly growing area of health care expenditures; complications in spine surgery significantly add to health care spending and may impact patient outcomes. The elderly, as one of the priority populations studied in research funded by AHRQ, are more prone than are many other groups to perioperative complications. Poor understanding of complication incidence makes patient counseling and shared decision making difficult. Better understanding of how patient factors contribute to operative outcomes may significantly improve patient engagement in discussion of treatment options. Development of a clinical tool that may predict occurrence of complications in spine surgery would be an innovative and valuable addition to the practice of spine surgery. This effort will build upon developed measures incorporating patient comorbidities, choice of surgical approach, and pre-operative diagnosis into a model estimating risk of complication occurrence. The principle goal of our research effort has been to build optimized and validated predictive models of complications after spinal surgery. A retrospective database assessment will be conducted, using the Medicare and Marketscan databases. Statistical analysis of the databases will be used to generate an appropriate adverse event predictive model, where the impact of individual comorbidities and other patient and procedure factors contributing to higher complication incidence is assessed. The study will aggregate patient data into appropriate cohorts, and analyze the data with logistic regression, CART, and other modeling methods. The innovative goal of this investigation will be to predict both risk of any complication and occurrence of specific types of complications in spinal surgery. After a predictive tool has been developed, the measure will be applied prospectively to spinal surgery patients, where complications will be prospectively assessed by an independent auditor and correlated with recording of patient centered outcome metrics recorded concurrently in our clinic. Appreciation of how patient factors contribute to surgical outcomes will significantly improve patient education and aid informed decision making, may benefit patient care, and will contribute to implementation of comparative effectiveness relative risk adjustment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Spine surgery has consistently manifested significant growth and is a large source of health care spending; many spine surgery procedures are performed upon older, Medicare-aged patients. Helping patients understand the risks of operative interventions will improve patient education, contribute to realistic patient expectations of surgical outcomes, and will yield better quality of life for surgical candidates. This study will develop a patient-centered measure of the risk of perioperative adverse events in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients, and correlate this measure to patient reported quality of life measures.",Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery,9322355,R01HS023800,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,246106,0.016281139511524358
"Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma PROJECT SUMMARY Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common aggressive type of lymphomas, is characterized by marked clinical and pathological heterogeneity that is reflected at the molecular level. It is well known that although the incidence rates for DLBCL were lower for African Americans (AA) than for European Americans (EA), AA patients were diagnosed at a significantly younger age and have worse 5-year survival compared with EA patients. The reason for this apparent racial/ethnic difference is unclear and cannot be fully explained by social stressors or access to care. We speculate that epigenetic variations could underlie the racial/ethnic differences because the pathogenesis of DLBCL is strongly linked to perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms, and population-specific cytosine modifications are a fundamental feature between human populations. In addition, greater epigenetic heterogeneity is linked with more aggressive DLBCL and poorer survival outcomes. Most prior studies of DLBCL epigenetics have assessed 5-methylcytosines (5mC) in predominantly EA patients. No studies have evaluated 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), an emerging stable and abundant modification with distinct gene regulatory and cellular functions, due mainly to technical limitations. Most importantly, no studies have assessed concurrently 5mC and 5hmC in both EA and AA DLBCL patients. Without an effective technique to obtain the complete landscape of modified cytosines, development of targeted epigenetic approaches to improve DLBCL disparities is unlikely. The objective of this Exploratory/Developmental study is to distinguish 5hmC from 5mC at the time of DLBCL diagnosis between AA and EA patients and evaluate their clinical significance. Our hypothesis is that the 5mC/5hmC signatures in tumor tissues differ between AA and EA patients and that these differences contribute to the well-known racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL risk and outcomes. The Specific Aims are to 1) distinguish 5hmC from 5mC in EA and AA patients and evaluate population-specific 5mC/5hmC loci; and 2) determine therapeutic response-associated 5hmC/5mC loci. Specifically, we will obtain tissues for 120 patients with DLBCL (60 AA and 60 EA) from the University of Chicago Lymphoma Biobank. We will combine an innovative technique, the Tet-assisted Bisulfite Sequencing (TAB-Seq) and the new Illumina EPIC array to accurately distinguish 5hmC from 5mC. We will perform an epigenome-wide scan to assess differences in 5hmC/5mC modification levels between AA and EA patients at presentation and also integrate both modifications to predict therapeutic response, defined as relapse within 24 months after treatment. This proposal addresses a critical research question in a highly innovative, cost-efficient, and timely manner, providing important data for the first time on the complete landscape of modified cytosines for racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL. The results are expected to have positive impact because it is possible that the identified epigenetic loci/biomarkers will provide new targets for individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to decrease mortality and burden of DLBCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans were diagnosed of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most aggressive lymphoma in adults, at a significantly younger age (54 years vs. 65 years) and have worse 5-year survival (45% vs. 54%) compared with European American patients. This work seeks to understand the biological bases of the racial/ethnic differences by identifying complete DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation signatures at the time of diagnosis between African American and European American patients with DLBCL. Successful completion of this study will lead to a much better understanding of epigenetic factors that underlie the apparent racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL, which should accelerate the development of race-based individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to substantially reduce the disparities observed in DLBCL among patients from different ethnic groups.",Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma,9455051,R21MD011439,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'American', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'Cell physiology', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endometrium', 'Enhancers', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevention approach', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Race', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinically significant', 'cost efficient', 'disparity reduction', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'ethnic difference', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'social', 'stressor', 'survival outcome', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor initiation']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2017,254325,-0.0025534826737029265
"Detecting and Monitoring Tardive Dyskinesia to Improve Patient Outcomes Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a common debilitating side effect of antipsychotic use. Characterized most notably by involuntary facial movements such as grimacing, involuntary lip, mouth, and tongue movements, and eye blinking, TD is difficult to treat and potentially irreversible. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are acutely aware of the impairment and disability experienced by patients who develop TD. Early detection of TD is critical so that appropriate interventions can be instituted. Unfortunately, despite professionals’ best efforts, it is often too late in the process and the involuntary movements are permanent. Antipsychotic prescriptions exceeded 50 million in 2011 and the reported incidence of TD is between 13% and 24%. Risk grows with advancing age, off-label uses, and chronic exposure to antipsychotics. Therefore, prevention and early detection are key to managing TD. However, current methods for monitoring patients require observation of patients at infrequent in-person visits or self-reporting by vigilant patients and their families. Therefore strong market potential exists for an automated detection system. This Phase I project proposes to leverage existing telepsychiatry and video interview data gathering technologies available commercially to efficiently collect and analyze two hundred 5-minute video interviews with individuals taking anti-psychotic medications. Half of the interviews will be with individuals living with diagnosed TD and the other without a diagnosis of TD. The participants in the study will be recruited to ensure an equal distribution of females and males as well as an ethnically and racially representative sample. The proposed data gathering strategy will provide the source material necessary to create a powerful supervised machine learning derived video and audio analysis tool to detect TD. The detection tool will be created using 80% of the collected video data as a training set and validated on the remaining 20% reserved as the control set. Based on industry experience with other supervised machine learning training sets and the amount of data to be collected, we set a goal of a 90% success rate in identifying TD positive and TD negative participants in the control set. Once the detection tool is complete the project will conclude by incorporating access to the tool into an existing smartphone app, iRxReminder, that is used for data gathering and monitoring of clinical trials. The iRxReminder system links patients directly to researchers and their electronic records. The modified app will be tested in the laboratory to ensure the interface can be easily used. In Phase II the iRxReminder system will be validated for use in supporting the self-management and symptom monitoring of medication taking by individuals living with chronic mental illnesses. Once feasibility is established, we propose a year-long RCT where participants will be monitored for early detection of TD along with goals for high adherence, improved control of symptoms and side effects, and more aggressive and frequent treatment responses by the healthcare team. A recent study reported that TD rates among newly treated elderly ranged from 7.2% for those taking Risperidone to 11.1% for those taking olanzapine after 2 years of treatment. Earlier meta-analyses estimate TD frequency in women to be 26.6% and in men 21.6%. Ethnically Chinese and Malaysian mental health patients were studied in Singapore and patients taking anti-psychotic medications were found to have TD in 40% and 29% of cases respectively. Regardless of prevalence, TD is a threat to patient adherence and quality of life. TD only remits in a minority of cases and can be permanent. With 50 million prescriptions for anti-psychotics written annually, more than 10 million persons living with a chronic mental illness are at risk of developing TD. There are likely over 6 million patients living with TD and the number of patients with TD is expected to grow with the aging population and increasing off- label use of antipsychotics. ",Detecting and Monitoring Tardive Dyskinesia to Improve Patient Outcomes,9410244,R43MH114763,"['Acute', 'Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Apple', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chinese People', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'FDA approved', 'Face', 'Family', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Involuntary Movements', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaysian', 'Medical Care Team', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Metoclopramide', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Monitoring Clinical Trials', 'Movement', 'Mydriasis', 'Neurologic', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychiatrist', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risperidone', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Administered', 'Singapore', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Tardive Dyskinesia', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Woman', 'aging population', 'base', 'chronic care model', 'cloud based', 'collaborative care', 'compliance behavior', 'disability', 'experience', 'field study', 'improved', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'male', 'medication compliance', 'men', 'new technology', 'olanzapine', 'racial and ethnic', 'severe mental illness', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"CREATIVE ACTION, LLC",R43,2017,260928,0.012526742848928692
"Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and other developed countries. About 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year. The incidence of stroke is expected to increase (due to diabetes, an aging population and a rise in obesity), which is a major public health concern and great economic burden to society. Early identification of people at risk of stroke is important as it allows for better planning and implementation of preventative strategies. A number of risk prediction models have been proposed for stroke using common biomarkers such as lipids, and conventional risk factors including age, gender, history of hypertension and smoking. However, these models do not adequately capture a substantial proportion of persons at high risk of stroke they lack precision (best accuracy is up to 50% by Framingham risk score) in risk estimation and have other limitations. Therefore, it is a necessity to improve the accuracy of a stroke risk prediction model. Therefore, we aim to develop a novel model using retinal vessel features and conventional risk factors which will provide higher accuracy on stroke prediction than the existing models and provide better preventative strategies for the people at risk of stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the risk of stroke. Hence, identification of patients at risk of incident stroke is critically needed to help prevent this life-threatening disease. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of stroke.",Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke,9465584,R43NS102100,"['Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'American', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Asians', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational Background', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologist', 'Obesity', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Width', 'aging population', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'platform-independent', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'screening', 'white matter']",NINDS,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R43,2017,303622,0.011741265620813127
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,9325499,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2017,317128,-0.017666398268290882
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Improving patient and caregiver engagement through the application of data science methods to audio recorded clinic visits stored in personal health libraries PROJECT SUMMARY    Forty to eighty percent of clinic visit information is forgotten by patients immediately post visit, a significant  barrier to self-­management leading to poor health outcomes. Visit summaries can improve recall, yet patient  uptake is limited and clinicians report significant burden in creating summaries for laypeople. Patients are  beginning to audio record visits and clinics are now offering this service. When patients receive a clinic  recording, 71% listen and 68% share it with a caregiver, resulting in improved understanding and self-­ management. Yet, unstructured recordings are difficult to navigate. Personal health libraries (PHLs) may help  patients organize health information;; yet current PHLs do not facilitate clinic-­recordings. The objective of this  project is to develop a PHL that integrates clinic audio-­recordings (Audio-­PHL), using data science methods to  link medical terms from the recording to trustworthy patient resources, which can be retrieved, organized,  edited and shared by patients. The specific aims are: Aim 1 Identify health information seeking needs and  strategies of older adults with multimorbidity and caregivers;; Aim 2 Develop an Audio-­PHL using data science  methods to securely analyze clinic visit recordings and make this information accessible and understandable  for patients;; and Aim 3 Demonstrate the usability and use of an Audio-­PHL in older adults with multimorbidity  and caregivers. Applicants hypothesize: (1) The Audio-­PHL will surpass acceptable usability metrics in older  adults and caregivers and (2) natural language processing (NLP) methods developed for the Audio-­PHL will  accurately identify key visit information (e.g. medication) and connect it to credible patient resources. The  development of the Audio-­PHL follows a user centered design model. In Aim 1, the applicants will use  participatory design activities with 48 end-­users to inform Audio-­PHL design. In Aim 2, the Audio-­PHL will be  created in iterative cycles informed by findings from Aim 1. In Aim 3, extensive usability evaluation will be  conducted in human computer interaction (HCI) laboratory settings to ensure Audio-­PHL surpasses acceptable  usability metrics. Field testing of the Audio-­PHL will follow via a patient-­randomized pilot trial with older adults  with multimorbidity from primary care. Participants (N=70) will receive an Audio-­PHL (intervention) or PHL  (control) with no recordings. Usability metrics and satisfaction will be assessed at one-­month. Preliminary data  on the impact of an Audio-­PHL on patient ability to seek, find and use health information with high confidence,  patient activation and caregiver confidence will also be gathered. The research is innovative because it will  provide patients and caregivers secure access to a PHL based on clinic-­recordings that uses data science  methods to organize visit information and connect it to trusted resources. The results are expected to have a  major positive impact because they will provide proof-­of-­principle for the use of an Audio-­PHL that utilizes the  benefits of clinic recordings through the novel application of data science methods, to improve health outcomes  for older adults with multimorbidity through greater knowledge and confidence in their ability to self-­manage.   PROJECT NARRATIVE    Between 40 – 80% of clinic visit information is forgotten immediately by patients, a significant impediment to  self-­management for older adults with multimorbidity that leads to poor health outcomes. The proposed

"Integrated Model of Palliative and Primary Care in Seriously Ill Older Adults Project Summary Background Palliative care is known to improve patient outcomes and reduce health care utiliza- tion in patients with cancer. But we know little on how to deliver palliative care to the large and growing population of older patients with multiple chronic conditions. Palliative care clinicians are a scarce resource, so care must be targeted to the subset of patients who would benefit most: those at highest risk of near-term death. This is a major challenge outside of specific diseases with known trajectories. Clinicians struggle with prognosis, and current statistical models perform poorly. Aims We will use novel predictive modeling methods (`machine learning') to identify complex old- er patients at high risk of one-year mortality, drawing on our team's prior work in data analytics and machine learning. We will apply these methods to a diverse population of older patients with multi- ple chronic conditions, in a large academic primary care network. Building on our team's track rec- ord of successful clinical trials, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of palliative care inte- grated with primary care, targeting older patients at the highest predicted risk of death. We will as- sess impact on a range of measurable patient-reported outcomes and health care utilization. Study design We will develop a model to predict one-year mortality in primary care patients over 65, using a rich set of variables from electronic health records. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning models are highly accurate for predicting mortality out-of-sample, i.e., in patients the model has never seen. We will identify patients at the highest risk of death—who would benefit most from scarce palliative care resources—and approach them to participate in a randomized trial, comparing usual primary care to primary care integrated with palliative care. The intervention, a series of home-based visits by palliative care clinicians, will build a longitudinal relationship with the patient and primary care team. This strategy is designed specifically to meet the needs of older pa- tients, as well as busy primary care clinicians. We will power the study to detect changes in two primary outcomes: quality of life and care intensity, measured by hospital and emergency visits. Other outcomes include symptom burden, advanced care planning, hospice use, and mortality. Implications This project will generate the first evidence on a new model of palliative care for older adults with multiple chronic illnesses, delivered `upstream' in the disease trajectory. We will build the technical and clinical infrastructure needed to target palliative care interventions for older adults outside of specific disease-based programs. A successful trial would facilitate broader adop- tion of similar interventions for older adults, and fundamentally transform the scale and scope of palliative care efforts in this population. Project Narrative Despite major advances in palliative care for patients with specific diseases, we know little about how to deliver palliative interventions `upstream'—earlier in the disease trajectory for older adults with multiple chronic conditions. We will apply advanced predictive modeling techniques (`machine learning') to identify older patients in a primary care setting who would benefit most from palliative care: those whose complex interplay of chronic conditions puts them at high risk of near-term death. Building on our team's strong infrastructure for clinical trials in palliative care, we will enroll the highest-risk patients in a randomized controlled trial, comparing usual primary care to primary care integrated with palliative care.",Integrated Model of Palliative and Primary Care in Seriously Ill Older Adults,9565691,R56AG055728,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Area Under Curve', 'Awareness', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Geriatrics', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'SF-12', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical infrastructure', 'cost', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'palliative', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'trial comparing']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R56,2017,382595,0.032033007803132146
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry. This research is expected to impact the clinical management of AAA disease, as well as the pre-surgical planning capabilities of vascular and endovascular aneurysm repair.",Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,9250195,R01HL121293,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Aneurysm', 'Award', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pressure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'repaired', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2017,398926,0.0010011231029669271
"Antecedent Medical Conditions and Medications: Associations with the Risk and Prognosis ALS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ALS affects people in middle to late ages, during a time of life where it is common to suffer from more than one health problem, yet there is little understanding of the effect of chronic medical conditions and medication use on susceptibility to ALS. There is mounting concern and recent evidence that certain medical conditions and medications are associated with an increased risk of developing ALS, while other conditions and medications appear to be inversely associated with ALS risk. We propose to investigate the role of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, as well as the drugs used to treat these disorders, as both risk and prognostic factors for ALS. This study has three specific aims: Aim 1, to investigate the association between antecedent medical conditions and the risk of developing ALS; Aim 2, to examine the relationship between certain classes of medication and the risk of developing ALS; and Aim 3, to determine whether medical conditions or medications present at diagnosis of ALS adversely or positively affect survival with ALS. We will assemble a retrospective cohort of Medicare beneficiaries who were continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare (Parts A, B and D) during the years 2006 through 2014. To address aims 1 and 2, we will conduct a nested case-control study to identify newly diagnosed (incident) patients with ALS in this cohort between 2008 and 2014 using a modified version of the case definition algorithm used by the National ALS Registry. We expect to identify 11,000 incident ALS cases. Using incidence density sampling, ten age- and sex-matched controls will be randomly chosen for each case from among Medicare beneficiaries who entered the Medicare cohort in the same year as the case, but had who had no codes for ALS, MND or closely related conditions prior to their matched cases' diagnosis dates. We will use Medicare inpatient, outpatient, and laboratory health claims to document the occurrence of metabolic, cardiovascular, and autoimmune conditions among the study subjects both before and after the diagnosis of ALS. The availability of Part D (pharmaceutical) claims for Medicare beneficiaries from 2006 onward will provide the opportunity to examine the association of commonly used medications with the risk and prognosis of ALS. We will use conditional logistic regression analyses to identify premorbid medical conditions and medications associated with the risk of developing ALS. To address specific aim 3, we will link the data from our incident ALS case group to mortality data and conduct survival analyses to determine whether antecedent medical conditions and medications present at diagnosis are associated with either shortened or prolonged survival with ALS. We will use survival analysis to determine whether there is an association between these conditions/medications and survival with ALS. This study will contribute significantly to the understanding of the role that metabolic factors, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease and autoimmunity play in the etiology and prognosis of ALS, and could lead to the development of new preventive or therapeutic interventions to prolong survival in ALS patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS: also known as Lou Gehrig's disease) is an adult-onset neuromuscular disorder that is the third most common neurodegenerative disease of aging (after Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases). It is critically important to identify modifiable risk factors present prior to diagnosis that affect the risk of developing ALS, and to also identify factors that are associated with the length of survival with this uniformly fatal disease. We hope that this study will identify modifiable risk factors that pu people at risk for ALS so that we can prevent this disabling disease, and we believe that studying the factors that influence length of survival with ALS will lead to the development of new preventive or therapeutic interventions to prolong survival among patients with ALS.",Antecedent Medical Conditions and Medications: Associations with the Risk and Prognosis ALS,9321614,R01TS000249,[' '],ATSDR,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,400000,-0.003884556757085822
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,9319536,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2017,449993,0.021406191647948748
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes.

"CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring ReThink Medical, Inc. proposes to develop an ambulatory version of the physiologic monitoring technology it validated in Phase I, the CorBand. The CorBand is designed to track key physiologic parameters that are predictive of cardiac decompensation, to detect the early stages of decompensation, and to relay both the physiologic data and generated alerts to relevant caregivers with the end goal of reducing hospitalizations by enabling proactive/preventative care in the heart failure population. Heart failure effects 5.8 million individuals in the US and the costs associated are approaching $40 billion annually. This technology will not only improve the quality of life for heart failure patients, but also help to reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that puts emphasis on preventative care through health monitoring technologies. Our specific aims include (1) manufacturing a robust version of the device for use in two large, long term, ambulatory studies. It will be validated using patients who have cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), activity levels, and fluid index derived from the CorBand will be compared with data collected from CIEDs manufactured by Medtronic and Boston Scientific and analyzed for correlation. (2) The CorBand will be deployed in a large ambulatory population of HF patients. We will collect the patient's clinical notes and note hospitalization events along with remote physiologic data from the CorBand. We will use this data to further build a predictive model for cardiac decompensation using a number of machine learning approaches. In aim (3), we will perform a controlled study on a population of HF patients. All the subjects will wear the CorBand; we will use the data from half the subjects to predict decompensation events, provide that information to subject's caregiver in order to provide preventative care. The other half will receive usual care. We will then examine the number of HF related hospitalizations in both groups to evaluate the ability of the CorBand to reduce hospitalizations. Our goal is to simplify the management of heart failure while improving the quality of care of the patients and reducing the associated costs. We will investigate the benefits of a novel, non-invasive multi-parameter sensor with telemetry for monitoring patients with heart failure combined with an algorithm for detecting early-stage cardiac decompensation with a goal of preventing hospitalizations.",CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring,9335418,R44HL125001,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Award', 'Boston', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cloud Service', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Edema', 'Electronics', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Office Visits', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Blind Study', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'clinical decision-making', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'health care service', 'heart rate variability', 'hemodynamics', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'indexing', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment group']",NHLBI,"RETHINK MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2017,490059,0.017243691015740012
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3–6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6–8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, “note bloat”, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9284760,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'hospital readmission', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,516245,0.028666112330687506
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients.

"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9283910,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2017,544529,0.018086127110272358
"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9313961,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2017,563079,-0.0076851556761404725
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9243329,R01NS097000,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Labyrinthine disorder', 'Learning', 'Leukocytes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cohort', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mRNA Expression', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'release factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2017,569977,0.01907081065555598
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,9265960,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'rapid diagnosis', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment response', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,577180,-0.02075642115147882
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9247214,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,598066,0.019162286823354174
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9266749,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phonation', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical practice', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,600547,-0.02247147373551552
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9421755,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid use', 'overdose death', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,601139,-0.013929949578023721
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes. Narrative The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the search of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes.

"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,9449181,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Videoconferences', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'implementation research', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,663165,-0.07871404464154935
"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9357725,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,687081,0.014085507623504934
"Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data It is a common clinical occurrence that neuroimaging scans obtained in the course of routine clinical care discover a prior brain infarction in patients with no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Indeed, epidemiologic studies indicate that silent brain infarctions (SBI) are far more common than strokes; MRI- defined SBI can be detected in ~20% of the healthy elderly. In these studies based on screened patients, the findings have been shown to be associated with subtle, typically unrecognized, deficits in physical and cognitive function. These imaging findings are also strong, independent risk factors for future stroke and dementia. Despite the very high prevalence of SBI in screened populations, and their serious consequences, little is known about the significance or the appropriate management of SBI when discovered incidentally in routine care. While there is strong evidence that antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy are effective in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke, the degree to which these results apply to patients with SBI is unclear. Because patients with SBI define a population that falls in between primary and secondary stroke prevention, the approach to these patients is marked by uncertainty and practice variation, making it an ideal condition for observational comparative effectiveness research. Nonetheless, there are serious challenges for the study of SBI. As patients have no overt symptoms, recruitment into a trial can be problematic. Comparative effectiveness research on SBI, using routinely collected data and leveraging the variation in care of these patients, is impeded by the fact that there are no ICD codes for SBI, and it is generally not included in structured fields of electronic health records (EHR) as it is typically considered an incidental finding. In order to establish the comparative effectiveness of treatment strategies for SBI in a large, heterogeneous population, we propose to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to identify individuals with SBI through the automated review of neuroradiology reports. We have performed preliminary work to demonstrate that such an approach is feasible. We will then apply state-of-the-science observational comparative effectiveness methods in a massive database with linked EHR and claims data to examine the effectiveness of statins and antiplatelet agents in preventing future stroke and dementia. Thus, our aims are: Aim 1: We will develop NLP algorithms that can accurately identify cases of SBI and white matter disease (WMD) in two different health systems. Aim 2: We will port, refine, and validate the NLP algorithm in a large heterogeneous database including more than 600 hospitals and 6500 clinics and identify a large cohort of patients with routinely-discovered SBI and WMD. Aim 3: We will characterize the cohort with respect to age- specific prevalence of SBI, management patterns, and the risk of future stroke and dementia associated with SBI and WMD. Aim 4: We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of preventive therapies (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally-discovered SBI. The goal of this project is to improve the evidence base for the prevention of stroke in patients with “silent brain infarct”—i.e., a stroke on neuroimaging (head CT or MRI) but no clinical evidence of a stroke. We will develop a computer-based algorithm using a technology known as natural language processing that can accurately identify cases of silent brain infarction among a large population of adults on whom neuroimages have been obtained, but who are without a history of clinically-evident cerebrovascular disease. We will estimate the comparative effectiveness of medications (statins and antiplatelet agents) on the risk of future stroke and dementia in patients with incidentally discovered and reported SBI.",Enabling Comparative Effectiveness Research in Silent Brain Infarction Through Natural Language Processing and Big Data,9365110,R01NS102233,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Infarction', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'White Matter Disease', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'effectiveness research', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'repository', 'routine care', 'screening', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,711929,0.020356194093649412
"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9195060,R01HL126700,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Apnea', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Pulse Rates', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic health disparity', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'portability', 'post stroke', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'stroke survivor', 'surveillance study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,722492,0.028037570847905497
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,9207492,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'effective therapy', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2017,749226,0.004457449319885521
"Interpretable Deep Learning Model for Longitudinal Electronic Health Records and Applications to Heart Failure Prediction   PROJECT  SUMMARY  Heart failure (HF) is a highly disabling and costly disease with a high mortality rate. In the pre­diagnostic phase  (i.e.,  12­36  months  before  diagnosis),  HF  is  difficult  to  detect  given  the  insidious  signs  and  symptoms.  After  diagnosis,  where  it  is not possible to reverse disease progression, efforts are made to avoid hospital admission  and  re­admission,  but  with  limited  capabilities  to  stratify  patients  by  risk.  We  propose  to  develop  interpretable  deep learning models applied to large­scale electronic health record (EHR) data to detect HF related events on  two  different  time  scales.  One  set  of  models will be developed to detect HF diagnosis one to two years before  actual  documented  diagnosis.  Separately,  we  propose  to  identify  HF  patients  who  are  at  risk  of  hospital  admission  and  readmission . The project focuses on developing deep learning models that offer the potential for  greater  accuracy,  clinical  interpretability,  and  utility  than  alternatives.  The  expected  deliverables  include  comprehensive  software  for  creating  deep  learning  algorithms  that  predict  HF  outcomes  and  related  software  tools  for  model  visualization.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning has shown tremendous success in many domains but is yet to have similar impact in health care.

"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",9313715,R01HL127028,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anthropometry', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular Abnormalities', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dyspnea', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise stress test', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Galectin 3', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Spirometry', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'aged', 'arterial stiffness', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'exercise intolerance', 'fasting glucose', 'fitness', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'longitudinal analysis', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'statistics', 'trend']",NHLBI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,1338683,0.012852903528924221
"Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination Project Summary / Abstract Between 1.6 and 3.8 million people each year suffer a mild TBI in the US alone. Reliable diagnosis and prompt treatments are vital to managing the often-serious short and long-term sequelae resulting from mild TBI. However, a reliable objective and accurate method for mild TBI diagnosis outside of a hospital setting, and in particular for determining RTP readiness, has eluded the clinical community. Current diagnosis and RTP assessments are based on patient symptoms, neurocognitive evaluations, and / or physical performance testing. Use of symptom scales are problematic for several reasons including subjectivity and reliability. Neurocognitive evaluations and physical tests (such as balance tests), although less subjective, require pre- injury baseline testing of subjects due to inherently large subject-to-subject variations in evaluation performances. Due to these reasons, current mild TBI diagnostic methods have limited applications and are not suitable for a significant majority of patients who suffer mild TBI. This project is aimed at developing an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI) based on physiologic changes in a patient after injury and providing a platform capable of RTP guidance. The method is based on quantification of well-known physiologic changes after a concussion, i.e. the impairment of autonomic function and altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured with transcranial Doppler (TCD). The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of a recently-developed analytical machine learning framework for the analysis of the CBF velocity (CBFV) waveforms. In contrast to previous methods used before, the proposed approach utilizes the entire shape of the complex CBFV waveform, thus obtaining subtle changes in blood flow that are lost in other analysis methods. Additionally, comprehensive verification between our platform and MRI will be performed following injury resulting in the first scientific experiments of this kind. The ultimate goal of this Phase II SBIR is to commercialize an objective and accurate software algorithm for reliable diagnosis and management of sports concussions which does not currently exist. The outcome will be a software suite integrated into existing TCD and will be marketed to emergency departments, neurology clinics, and other healthcare providers involved in mild TBI diagnosis and RTP management. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem in the United States contributing to a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability. Mild TBI concussions account for over 80% of all TBIs sustained and a major problem is the high rate of mis-diagnosis due to lack of objective measures and delayed onset of symptoms. This project aims to develop the first objective concussion evaluation method using a novel analysis platform that can obtain subtle, physiologic changes in cerebral hemodynamics. Successful completion of this project will result in a portable diagnostic device suitable for use in many scenarios where concussion diagnosis is inaccurate or unavailable today.",Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination,9323604,R44NS092209,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Concussion', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Study', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Readiness', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spin Labels', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Variant', 'balance testing', 'base', 'brain health', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'high school', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'novel', 'pediatric department', 'performance tests', 'portability', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,"NEURAL ANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2017,1500000,-0.0071987392827626276
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9278036,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2017,1755747,0.002783392570974395
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9244766,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2017,2210408,-0.04997221324951173
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,9052846,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment response', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,1,-0.02075642115147882
"Variation in Surgeon-Level Intraoperative Costs: An Intervention Study Project Summary The growth of national health care expenditures is unsustainable, reaching a staggering $2.9 trillion in 2013 (8). Surgical expenditures are estimated to account for 29% of costs and consume 1/14th of our nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025 (2, 3). Time in the operating room is extremely costly, with estimates as high as $100 per minute(4). Surgical supplies alone represent up to 50% of operating room expenses(14). Historically, there has been little incentive to contain costs, but with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), reimbursements are now linked to a diagnosis or a procedure, rather than individual components of a patient's care(10). This shifts the burden of reducing expenses to health care providers who must now deliver high quality care on a fixed income. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), in particular, has an interest in evaluating, optimizing, and delivering valuable healthcare under this new framework. Surgeons have a direct impact on the cost of a patient's care as they pre-select items used for cases and open additional instruments as the operation progresses. It is common for a single surgical implant to cost thousands of dollars. Despite this, research describing intraoperative expenses is rare (16). This proposal seeks to remedy this information gap by (I) calculating surgeon-specific intraoperative costs for common general surgery operations across several academic hospitals, (II) identifying factors that drive these expenses, and (III) developing and implementing an intervention aimed to reduce these expenses. This project will retrospectively analyze electronic medical record (EMR) and hospital accounting data to determine average surgeon-expenditures for several common operations across multiple institutions. Multiple logistic regression analysis will identify the impact of patient and surgeon factors on costs. Semi-structured interviews of focus groups will shape development of the intervention. This will be followed by a six-month implementation phase and prospective analysis of the intervention's efficacy and feasibility. Results of this study will inform hospitals and health care systems about the relative costs of items used in their operating rooms and the factors driving these expenses. Importantly, it will introduce a methodology for institutions to analyze their own expenses and provide a generalizable, structured intervention that can be adapted for their use. Project Narrative There is growing pressure nationally, including from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), for critical assessments of the value provided by healthcare organizations. This proposal seeks to understand the costs of providing surgical care, specifically, the costs of surgical supplies for general surgery operations, which reflect a large but mutable component of expenditures. Further, this proposal seeks to introduce and evaluate a prospective intervention to reduce these expenses, the results of which will inform hospitals and providers about mechanisms they can use to reduce costs.",Variation in Surgeon-Level Intraoperative Costs: An Intervention Study,9259659,F32HS025079,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F32,2016,63755,0.01911110460599166
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9164916,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FMR1', 'FMR1 Premutation', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2016,131004,-0.0008071317812433588
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,9108235,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'diagnostic assay', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'training opportunity', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2016,137160,-0.005332178621049587
"Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is defined as a severe infection with dangerous physiologic changes, organ dysfunction or death, which hospitalizes over 1.6 million people in the U.S. annually. Sepsis is a priority for the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services due to its healthcare impact, incidence and staggering annual cost, which exceed $20 billion and 5% of all U.S. hospital costs. All sepsis patients, even those with mild sepsis are at risk for in- hospital complications and death, but have improved outcomes if identified early. Sepsis recognition, however, is challenging due to the heterogeneity of patients who may manifest a wide array of clinical presentations. Electronic medical record (EMR) linked computer programs, known as clinical decision support (CDS) tools, have become ubiquitous to assist providers, including identifying sepsis patients. Unfortunately, all CDS tools in the literature miss 20-30% of sepsis patients and frequently misidentify non-sepsis patients as sepsis patients. Inaccurate CDS tools generate far too many false positive alerts, creating the dangerous condition of “alert fatigue” in which providers become habituated to all alerts, threatening patient safety and even leading to fatal consequences.  The PI and Co-I of this proposal collaboratively developed a CDS software called Sepsis-Alert for adult emergency department (ED) patients. It was fully implemented into Detroit Medical Center's (DMC) EMR live environment and has now been continually operational to provide real-time ongoing monitoring of all ED patients at Sinai Grace Hospital of DMC since October 2014. Our analysis of 25,000 ED visits reveals that while Sepsis-Alert's performance exceeds any reported performance, it still remains unacceptably inaccurate. All the CDS tools, including ours, have two limitations: (1) they lack a mechanism to learn from their past erroneous decisions and consequently repeat the same mistakes again and again, and (2) their decision- making process is fixed and treats all patients in the same way even in face of high heterogeneity of patients,  The main thrust of this research project is to develop an innovative prototype CDS software that functions like Sepsis-Alert but without the two limitations for the same ED sepsis screening purpose. We will develop the software system by utilizing data extracted from the EMR and will test and fine tune the system in over 35,000 retrospective and prospective patients at Sinai Grace Hospital. The proposed prototype, Intelligent Sepsis Alert, will have the cutting edge capabilities of recognizing the subtleties of sepsis, categorizing patients and learning from its own mistakes to avoid repeat them. CDS tools of the future can and must be better. Machine learning is the solution to optimizing patient care without creating a harmful environment. The final deliverable of this project will be a highly accurate and advanced program readily adoptable by any health system or hospital to improve sepsis care and create a safer healthcare environment. 1 Project Narrative  Sepsis is a toxic response to a severe infection and represents a healthcare epidemic, which afflicts millions of people and accounts for 5% of all hospital costs and over $20 billion in the U.S. annually. This project's objective is to develop a cutting edge computer based tool, called Intelligent Sepsis Alert, with the power of machine intelligence (a form of artificial intelligence) and the ability to learn that will accurately identify sepsis patients for healthcare providers extremely early in their hospital course to ensure that patients receive all of the necessary life-saving interventions they need. Intelligent Sepsis Alert will be readily adoptable by other hospitals and health systems and by providing the critical real-time, bedside support for early sepsis identification will translate into multitudes of deaths prevented, abundant intensive care unit admissions avoided, hundreds of thousands of dollars saved and thousands of wasted nursing and physician man-hours eliminated.",Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning,9166164,R21HS024750,[' '],AHRQ,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,149836,0.025780703235823942
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9084432,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Eotaxin', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2016,156324,-0.019878059715930322
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9242212,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2016,162518,0.014082200190296839
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8984911,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2016,163944,0.010776666566664227
"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course No abstract available PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course.

"Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place SUMMARY This proposal is for an NLM sponsored K01 Mentored Career Development Award. The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention. The objective of this application is to map data collected from physiological sensors with the behavior patterns of persons with dementia, as well as the caregiver to understand the physiological changes associated with behavior changes to facilitate early intervention through timely alerts to clinicians.",Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place,9222881,K01LM012439,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Community Health', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instructor', 'instrument', 'learned behavior', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile application', 'multisensory', 'primary caregiver', 'professor', 'programs', 'rehabilitation technology', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'support tools', 'trait', 'usability', 'web app']",NLM,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,168375,-0.015430851300845405
"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization. Given the rapidly rising numbers of patients with dementia, reducing potentially preventable hospitalization could have an enormous impact on public health.",Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms,9084484,K08AG048321,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Assessment tool', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Bioinformatics', 'Capsicum', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kale - dietary', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleeplessness', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'behavior change', 'career', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'dementia care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'geriatric mental health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2016,175103,0.0023460273896311794
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9147610,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'portability', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,190216,0.02878273063571022
"Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults exhibit poor recovery and are at high risk for rehospitalization after acute heart failure. Current rehabilitation and clinical management strategies have shown only modest benefits because the mechanisms underlying poor outcomes remain under recognized and therefore unmitigated. The proposed study will address this critical knowledge gap by examining the role of systemic mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity as a fundamental factor underlying poor physical function in hospitalized acute decompensated heart failure, the success of rehabilitation, and the prognosis of patients following hospitalization. This will be accomplished in a highly translational and cost-effective manner as an ancillary study to REHAB-HF (R01AG045551; PI: Kitzman), a multi-center clinical trial funded by the NIA that tests the hypothesis that impaired physical function underlies adverse outcomes in older hospitalized ADHF patients and employs a novel rehabilitation program that targets multiple domains of physical function for 12 weeks beginning during hospitalization. The results of REHAB-HF can impact clinical practice; however, its outcomes do not directly address potential mechanisms of action. Mitochondrial function is likely candidate for mediating physiological decline in REHAB-HF participants, because these organelles are sensitive to a myriad of intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to aging, physical function, heart failure, and hospitalization.  Mitochondrial dysfunction across multiple tissues has been implicated in physiological decline associated with heart failure and is thought to be mediated by circulating factors that affect systemic bioenergetic capacity. Therefore, we propose that respirometric profiling of circulating cells can be used to report on systemic bioenergetic decline in heart failure patients and will be associated with physical function and long term outcomes - including rehospitalization rate. We will determine whether the REHAB-HF rehabilitation program increases bioenergetic capacity, compared to control, thereby improving functional outcomes. Bioenergetic profiling of multiple blood cell populations will enable us to identify the specific cell types and bioenergetic parameters, or patterns comprised of multiple variables, that are most closely associated with REHAB-HF outcomes such as physical function and quality of life. We will also determine the ability of blood cells to report on systemic bioenergetic decline y examining relationships with mitochondrial function measured in skeletal muscle. Successful strategies for mitigating poor physical function and improving long-term outcomes rely on the identification of mechanisms that contribute to the vulnerability of patients after discharge. Bioenergetic profiling may enable the identification of patients in need of more intensive management and targeted rehabilitation. The advancement of blood-based bioenergetic profiling will enhance the use of this promising test in future trials, and potentially, in the cliical care of older patients with the wide range of chronic medical conditions associated with physical disability and poor clinical outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will examine the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the physical function of older adults hospitalized for acute heart failure, and th long term rehabilitation outcomes of these patients. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the success of recovery will lead to improved treatment strategies that can be personalized in order to maximize benefits for individual patients. The results of this study can improve the management of older adults hospitalized with acute heart failure and will be generalizable to the broader issues of age-related bioenergetic decline and post-hospitalization syndrome.        ",Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure,9112221,R21AG051077,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Ancillary Study', 'Bioenergetics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise stress test', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heart failure', 'Hormones', 'Hospitalization', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardium', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'exercise intolerance', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation management', 'respiratory', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2016,190640,0.012930669944241446
"Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. CDI, which disproportionately affects older adults, can result in fulminant, life-threatening colitis and lead to multiple recurrnt episodes. There is an urgent need for validated biomarker-based clinical decision-making tools to predict which patients will experience adverse outcomes from CDI. There is a gap in knowledge regarding which known and yet to-be-discovered biomarkers, derived from the host, microbiome and pathogen, will best predict complications and recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate accurate risk-prediction models for adverse outcomes following CDI that can be used to guide therapy. The next step in pursuit of that goal, and our overall objective for the proposed research, is to discover new candidate biomarkers and determine which ones together best predict complicated CDI in an adjusted model. Our central hypothesis is that a biomarker-based model will better predict complicated CDI compared to models based on clinical variables alone. To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims: 1) validate host biomarkers previously shown to associate with complicated CDI; 2) discover novel microbial biomarkers for complicated CDI; and 3) develop a candidate biomarker-based predictive model for complicated CDI. We will collect sera and stool prospectively in a cohort of older adults to determine if characteristics of the microbiome, microbial features of C. difficile, levels of antitoxin antibodies, and/or inflammatory mediators associate with complications. Multivariable models will be constructed using linear regression and machine learning techniques and model diagnostics will be used to generate a final portable, biomarker-based predictive model for use in future studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. We currently lack a complete understanding as to why certain patients with CDI progress to severe disease with increased complications, including death, while others recover. Our research proposes to discovery objective, readily obtainable indicators from serum/stool that predict adverse outcomes from CDI early after initial disease onset. It is envisioned that this could lead to a paradigm-shift in management by directing specific treatment strategies, including more costly therapeutics such as antibody treatment, fecal transplant and newer antibiotics, towards patients who would most benefit. This research takes the first steps towards development of a biomarker-based predictive tool to aid clinicians in treatment decisions.",Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection,9094678,R21AI120599,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antitoxins', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Biological Markers', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Colon', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HGF gene', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Loop ileostomy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Serum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxin', 'Transplantation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'fecal transplantation', 'high risk', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'procalcitonin', 'prospective', 'secondary outcome', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2016,193750,0.003575393410879698
"Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) affects ~1.5 million persons annually in the United States with fifteen to 30% of patients suffering long-term disability after injury. We remain in the early phase of understanding this disease and one of the greatest barriers to studying the disease and developing appropriate therapy is the difficulty in diagnosis and outcome prediction. Generally, the diagnosis of MTBI relies on using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a 15-point gross measurement of eye-opening, motor and verbal response. The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) workshop in 2014 indicated that use of GCS score as a single classifier for TBI is insufficient and proposed that neuroimaging play a larger role towards the development of objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. We have specific experience in studying novel MRI techniques that show much promise in evaluating MTBI patients. The goal of the current proposal is to bring these novel MRI techniques to clinical use. We propose to combine information from objective MR imaging features with clinical information to learn the patterns that can best distinguish patients from controls and predict long-term outcome using machine learning. We will validate our tool using a separate subject cohort. Such a tool would be an extremely powerful clinical tool to identify at-risk patients for early intervention. Additionally, this research will identify the most clinically relevant MR metrics, thereby pointing the way to novel therapeutic pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a major public health problem for which there is a lack of evidence-based, quantitative and objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate recent advances in MR imaging of MTBI with clinically important information using advanced machine-learning computational algorithms to identify the most clinically relevant features, thus allowing us to distinguish patients from controls and to predict clinical outcome. If successful, this research will provide an objective tool for classification and outcome prediction in MTBI and will be a critical advance in both the clinical and research arenas in the study of traumatic brain injury.",Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury,9180408,R21NS090349,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Common Data Element', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Eye', 'FarGo', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iron', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Non-linear Models', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disability', 'drug development', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'magnetic field', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood regulation', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2016,196059,-0.03004660346366954
"Building Multistage Treatment Regimens for Depression after Acute Coronary SyndromeSyndrome Building Multistage Treatment Policy for Depression after Acute Coronary Syndrome Project Summary Depression is not only commonly observed among patients who experienced acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but also has been shown to increase risks for recurrent ACS and mortality. Despite its high prevalence and serious impact, management of post-ACS depression remains poor because of ineciencies in depression screen- ing, limited treatment options of depression after ACS, and lack of e ective procedure if initial treatment fails. To address these issues, clinical researchers have tried to develop personalized stepped care procedures for post-ACS depression patients; this involves o ering patients the choice of receiving psychotherapy and/or antidepressant treatment and adjusting treatment as needed. The treatment decisions are usually based on patient demographics, treatment preference, medical history, progress of disease, and comorbid conditions. With the development of modern technologies, the number of available treatments increases, and more pa- tient information are collected in clinical research. Thus excavating useful information for treatment decisions is becoming more challenging. In this project, we propose to develop a principled way to construct simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional data, that can be used to guide treatment selection throughout the course of the disease. Aim 1 of the project is devoted to the development of vari- able selection methodology for constructing multistage treatment policies using statistical machine learning techniques. The proposed research seeks to incorporate the popular variable selection technique (LASSO) into existing treatment policy search approaches, namely Q-learning and A-Learning, for developing optimal treatment policies and for identifying patient response status to initial treatment { an important factor for tailoring treatment in the subsequent stages. Aim 2 evaluates the proposed methods, applies the methods to post-ACS depression data, and addresses some computational challenges. Statistical research in this area has been focused on the development of evidence-based treatment policies using pre-chosen models and variables; few if any discuss how to select models or variables in a principled way. The proposed work aims to ll this gap in methodology using modern machine learning techniques. Project Narratives The proposed research aims to answer the following question:\How to excavate simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional, longitudinal medical data in a principled way?"" This is a crucial step in the management of chronic disease, such as depression, for which a large number of variables are collected over time, by facilitating the construction of a parsimonious clinical decision system.",Building Multistage Treatment Regimens for Depression after Acute Coronary SyndromeSyndrome,9180305,R21MH108999,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Weight', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'individualized medicine', 'mortality', 'preference', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'simulation', 'treatment response']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2016,200000,-0.00210928636840078
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill Thrombocytopenia is extremely frequent in critically ill patients. However, the role of acute platelet responses in critically ill patients is not well studied, and the multifactorial etiology of thrombocytopenia in the ICU makes it difficult to understand, or understand whether or not to treat it. In several situations such as traumatic injury or sepsis, very low platelet counts have been to bleeding, thrombosis and end-organ injury. Platelets have been extensively studied as a key component of hemostasis, but a rapidly emerging concept is that platelets are also key effector cells in systemic inflammatory processes as both instigators of local and systemic inflammatory reactions and also participants in the inflammation that contributes to tissue injury. The link between platelets and inflammation is complex and bidirectional, as inflammatory ligands have been shown to regulate platelet function and activated platelets induce inflammatory responses in other cell types. The overarching theme of this proposal is to study platelet dynamics in critically ill patients, construct clinical endotypes of thrombocytopenia in this population, and to relate these endotypes to underlying mesoscale mechanisms through computational modeling. We will use a large electronic health record-based database and a tri-state trauma database as source data to construct these endotypes. We define endotype as clinical patterns defined along four dimensions: (1) baseline information (demographic, chronic disease burden, severity of illness and admitting diagnosis), (2) features of the platelet count time series (rate of decrease, nadir, etc.), (3) concurrent interventions, and (4) outcome. The computational approach will attempt to root clinical endotypes in mechanistic interpretations (or collections of alternative interpretations), contributing to focus basic science investiagtions, and to close key knowledge gaps preventing the design and use of targeted anti-platelet-inflammatory therapies in the critically ill. Computational models will be developed at different levels of complexity, with a specific attention to tie underlying mechanisms to functional assays routinely performed in thrombocytopenic patients, such as prothrombin time, activated coagulation time, and thromboelastogram. Platelets is a blood component playing a central role in coagulation and the inflammatory response. A low platelet counts is seen extremely often in acutely ill patients. This proposal will use large databases to find patterns associated with low platelets, how decreasing or low platelet counts are associated with disease and outcome, and use computer model to link the time evolution of platelet counts to mechanisms of disease. Hopefully, the research will lead to more focused therapeutic approaches targeting platelets in critically ill patients.",Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill,9168282,R21HL133891,"['Acute', 'Acute Lung Injury', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Factor', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Effector Cell', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prothrombin time assay', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'attenuation', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'design', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2016,217444,-0.0030994309682802583
"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI. Such an assay would reduce the interval between the onset of CDI symptoms and diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment of patients with CDI, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in patients without CDI, and decreasing healthcare-based transmission of this common, life-threatening infection.",Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection,9088345,R21AI119692,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Air', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diarrhea', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exotoxins', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Gases', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Odors', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proliferating', 'Provider', 'Pseudomembranous Colitis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic Megacolon', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Tube', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air sampling', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'forest', 'gut microbiome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2016,221875,-0.030022137304976357
"Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an innovative relative risk model predicting incidence of complications in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients. Spine surgery is a rapidly growing area of health care expenditures; complications in spine surgery significantly add to health care spending and may impact patient outcomes. The elderly, as one of the priority populations studied in research funded by AHRQ, are more prone than are many other groups to perioperative complications. Poor understanding of complication incidence makes patient counseling and shared decision making difficult. Better understanding of how patient factors contribute to operative outcomes may significantly improve patient engagement in discussion of treatment options. Development of a clinical tool that may predict occurrence of complications in spine surgery would be an innovative and valuable addition to the practice of spine surgery. This effort will build upon developed measures incorporating patient comorbidities, choice of surgical approach, and pre-operative diagnosis into a model estimating risk of complication occurrence. The principle goal of our research effort has been to build optimized and validated predictive models of complications after spinal surgery. A retrospective database assessment will be conducted, using the Medicare and Marketscan databases. Statistical analysis of the databases will be used to generate an appropriate adverse event predictive model, where the impact of individual comorbidities and other patient and procedure factors contributing to higher complication incidence is assessed. The study will aggregate patient data into appropriate cohorts, and analyze the data with logistic regression, CART, and other modeling methods. The innovative goal of this investigation will be to predict both risk of any complication and occurrence of specific types of complications in spinal surgery. After a predictive tool has been developed, the measure will be applied prospectively to spinal surgery patients, where complications will be prospectively assessed by an independent auditor and correlated with recording of patient centered outcome metrics recorded concurrently in our clinic. Appreciation of how patient factors contribute to surgical outcomes will significantly improve patient education and aid informed decision making, may benefit patient care, and will contribute to implementation of comparative effectiveness relative risk adjustment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Spine surgery has consistently manifested significant growth and is a large source of health care spending; many spine surgery procedures are performed upon older, Medicare-aged patients. Helping patients understand the risks of operative interventions will improve patient education, contribute to realistic patient expectations of surgical outcomes, and will yield better quality of life for surgical candidates. This study will develop a patient-centered measure of the risk of perioperative adverse events in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients, and correlate this measure to patient reported quality of life measures.",Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery,9144770,R01HS023800,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,246106,0.016281139511524358
"Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Patients often have poor access to screening and vaccination, and present in advanced stages, for which chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of failure and toxicity. Although intensifying chemotherapy can improve tumor control and survival, toxicity is often unacceptably high. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoRT are therefore needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue. In contrast, image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) is a modern technique that maximizes target dose and minimizes normal tissue dose. Multiple studies have found that IG-IMRT can significantly reduce organ dose and reduce toxicity compared to standard RT. These studies support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT can permit delivery of more intensive chemotherapy. For example, gemcitabine, a potent radiosensitizer, has been found to improve survival for cervical cancer patients in randomized trials (Dueñas-Gonzalez et al.). However, the toxicity when delivered with standard RT is extreme (>80% grade 3-4 toxicity). Therefore, this regimen has not replaced cisplatin alone as the standard of care. In contrast, our research group has found that the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine was increased when given with IG-IMRT. A large international multi-institutional trial has also found lower rates of toxicity with IG-IMRT compare to standard chemoRT. These findings support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT, by reducing bowel and bone marrow dose, could permit delivery of more effective concurrent chemotherapy. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for many pelvic malignancies. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial.  CVM-1421 is an emerging NCI-funded randomized phase II trial within the NRG Oncology Cooperative Group that will test the hypothesis that adding concurrent triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, to concurrent cisplatin and RT can improve outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced cervix cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation. This trial presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of IG- IMRT on normal tissue toxicity, as it will be the first cooperative group trial to permit IG-IMRT in this population. This trial also presents an opportunity to study ways to improve IG-IMRT quality, as there has been considerable controversy in how to optimally design IG-IMRT plans, due to their increased complexity. The goal of our research is to study the effect of IG-IMRT on toxicity, quality of life, and treatment outcomes, under varying intensities of chemotherapy. We will also implement a novel technique called knowledge-based planning (KBP) in order to improve plan quality and achieve optimal IG-IMRT dose distributions. This research could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care for pelvic malignancies, and will lay groundwork for future studies testing novel technologies in clinical trial settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) will reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without triapine. We are in an optimal situation to ask this question because the randomized phase II trial that will set the background for our study is evaluating the efficacy of more intensive chemotherapy while allowing both IG-IMRT and standard radiation treatment techniques. It would be beneficial for clinicians and patients to know whether IG-IMRT will reduce toxicity and improve quality of life. Further, this study could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care.",Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421,9104120,R01CA197059,"['American', 'Anterior', 'Bone Marrow', 'Boxing', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic', 'Health', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Modeling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Population', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitor', 'Secondary to', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'gastrointestinal', 'gemcitabine', 'image guided', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'new technology', 'novel', 'oncology', 'phase I trial', 'phase II trial', 'radiation effect', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,253619,-0.026181322934763676
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies.

"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,9119862,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Huntington Disease', 'Huntington gene', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2016,356244,-0.023771173722246432
"Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder As many as 53% of students report experiencing depression during college, and these depressive episodes are associated with a higher frequency of academic problems, comorbidity, and suicide. Although there are effective options for treatment, the majority of individuals (>70%) do not pursue services, and even for those who do, response rates remain modest (~40-50%). As a means of increasing accessibility to treatment, internet-based interventions for depression have been developed and tested. Despite increased availability, response to internet-based interventions continues to vary substantially, and failed treatment often contributes to persistence and worsening of symptoms. Therefore, identifying individuals with a high likelihood of responding to internet-based treatment would represent a major advance and address a critical unmet need.  In recent years, promising approaches for testing the heterogeneity of the treatment effects – delineating which individuals are likely to respond to a given treatment – have been developed. However, their use for identifying predictors of treatment response in depression remains unclear. To address this unmet need, the proposed study will test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response following internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression in a large, representative college sample (Boston Consortium of Colleges and Universities which includes 7 schools). Members of the consortium have committed to screening all incoming freshmen (N = ~14,000) through a rigorous online assessment and to offer iCBT to students with elevated levels of depressive symptoms (i.e., minor or major depression). The following steps will be pursued. First, in the initial phase of the study, freshmen students from the Boston Consortium will be screened for depression through an online survey, and they also will complete web-based neurocognitive tasks probing key mechanisms underpinning depression. Depressed students will be invited to enroll in iCBT, and a predictive algorithm will be developed based on assessments across different units of analysis (i.e., clinical characteristics, neurocognitive indices) to identify iCBT responders. Second, after the development phase, an independent sample of college students will be recruited to validate the predictive algorithm. This validation phase will use clinical indicators and neurocognitive data. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data targeting key mechanisms within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) will be acquired from a subset of participants. Neural data will be integrated to determine whether they improve the predictive algorithm. Third, data across independent samples will be combined, which will increase power to refine our predictive model for both acute and sustained response. In summary, there are alarming rates of depression among college students, and only a minority of students utilize mental health services. The proposed research will personalize our approach to depression treatment, which, ultimately, will improve effectiveness and better inform mental health care across college campuses. Depression is common, recurrent, and debilitating among college students, and the majority of depressed individuals (>70%) do not pursue treatment. Internet-based interventions are effective, low-cost, and easily disseminated, and the goal of this project is to test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response to an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression. This innovative approach - which relies on an integration of data across units of analysis (e.g., self- report, neurocognitive, and neural data) – promises to optimize treatment outcomes for depression, and therefore, reduce associated negative consequences including academic problems, risky behavior engagement, and suicidality.",Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder,9314157,R56MH109566,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Boston', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'college', 'control trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'minor depressive disorder', 'minority student', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuromechanism', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'reward expectancy', 'screening', 'suicidal', 'support tools', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R56,2016,364740,-0.01610197134681202
"Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia Project Summary ""Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention in Schizophrenia”  Schizophrenia is one of the most debilitating disorders in the world today. It affects over 2.4 million adult Americans each year. NIMH director Dr. Thomas Insel has declared “The best chance for preventing serious functional disability among people with schizophrenia may be to intervene at the earliest stages of the disorder, at the first episode of psychosis or even before symptoms appear. However, to act before symptoms appear requires improved predictive capacity” (NIMH 2011 Budget). Creating tools to identify high-risk, `prodromal' individuals may be the single most important step towards developing effective interventions to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), and thereby also reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with schizophrenia. Recent studies have shown that over 54% of individuals with schizophrenia are re-hospitalized within the first 12 months following their initial hospitalization. Even after the first hospitalization, preventing relapse and re-hospitalization may lessen the long-term severity of the illness. In this SBIR Phase I study, we propose to determine the feasibility of screening for prodromal individuals and individuals at high risk of relapse by applying interpretive algorithms to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD). We hypothesize that PGMSD can effectively assist in screening for prodromal individuals who are progressing toward psychosis as well as for remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP).  In Phase I, we plan to recruit 70 individuals who have been or are being evaluated at the Prodromal clinics at Columbia, UCSD, and UCLA, where an estimated 70 to 90% of clients already own Smartphones. Data gathered may include: the frequency of telephone calls, emails, and texts, to assess within person changes in social connectedness; GPS, accelerometer data, to assess physical activity, isolation, and sleep patterns. In the past, several IRB-approved studies have used smartphones for gathering similar data from patients. Algorithms will be developed using several techniques including machine learning to convert the meta-level data into measures of social functioning, physical isolation, physical activity, and sleep/wake reversals. In addition to achieving technological success, our goal in Phase I is to provide evidence of our ability to use PGMSD algorithms to differentiating group means of participants who are controls, prodromal, or experiencing their FEP (SIPS 1 or 2; 3, 4, or 5; or 6).  In Phase II, we will further develop and validate these algorithms. If successful, the Phase II project will have a large and sustained impact as our algorithms will help (1) identify at-risk individuals who `are' or `are not' progressing toward conversion, (2) serve as an objective measure of treatment effectiveness; (3) give rise to clinical reports delivered to EHR systems that hold promise for preventing relapse during the critical 12 months after initial diagnosis, potentially reducing hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. Project Narrative The proposed research protocol seeks to determine the feasibility of identifying individuals progressing toward a first psychotic episode or re-hospitalization by applying interpretive algorithms developed in part using machine learning to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD) collected from the smartphones of 70 participants ages 18-30. If successful, the PGMSD-derived algorithms will assist in screening for prodromal individuals progressing toward psychosis as well as with remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP), potentially decrease hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. This passive data gathering approach will augment existing active data collection approaches, aid clinicians in focusing on interpreting rather than gathering data from their clients, and could modify clinical paradigms by shifting treatment from individuals suffering from Schizophrenia to individuals who are at risk of developing psychosis with the goal of achieving `secondary' and eventually `primary' prevention.",Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia,9201713,R43MH107097,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Incipient Schizophrenia', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupational', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Poverty', 'Primary Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Universities', 'Work', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'information gathering', 'insight', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prevent', 'programs', 'real world application', 'relapse risk', 'screening', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,"TELESAGE, INC.",R43,2016,366201,-0.0007389757028807468
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,9119612,R01MH103148,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'mood symptom', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'relapse patients', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,388305,-0.0096962773834221
"Antecedent Medical Conditions and Medications: Associations with the Risk and Prognosis ALS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ALS affects people in middle to late ages, during a time of life where it is common to suffer from more than one health problem, yet there is little understanding of the effect of chronic medical conditions and medication use on susceptibility to ALS. There is mounting concern and recent evidence that certain medical conditions and medications are associated with an increased risk of developing ALS, while other conditions and medications appear to be inversely associated with ALS risk. We propose to investigate the role of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, as well as the drugs used to treat these disorders, as both risk and prognostic factors for ALS. This study has three specific aims: Aim 1, to investigate the association between antecedent medical conditions and the risk of developing ALS; Aim 2, to examine the relationship between certain classes of medication and the risk of developing ALS; and Aim 3, to determine whether medical conditions or medications present at diagnosis of ALS adversely or positively affect survival with ALS. We will assemble a retrospective cohort of Medicare beneficiaries who were continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare (Parts A, B and D) during the years 2006 through 2014. To address aims 1 and 2, we will conduct a nested case-control study to identify newly diagnosed (incident) patients with ALS in this cohort between 2008 and 2014 using a modified version of the case definition algorithm used by the National ALS Registry. We expect to identify 11,000 incident ALS cases. Using incidence density sampling, ten age- and sex-matched controls will be randomly chosen for each case from among Medicare beneficiaries who entered the Medicare cohort in the same year as the case, but had who had no codes for ALS, MND or closely related conditions prior to their matched cases' diagnosis dates. We will use Medicare inpatient, outpatient, and laboratory health claims to document the occurrence of metabolic, cardiovascular, and autoimmune conditions among the study subjects both before and after the diagnosis of ALS. The availability of Part D (pharmaceutical) claims for Medicare beneficiaries from 2006 onward will provide the opportunity to examine the association of commonly used medications with the risk and prognosis of ALS. We will use conditional logistic regression analyses to identify premorbid medical conditions and medications associated with the risk of developing ALS. To address specific aim 3, we will link the data from our incident ALS case group to mortality data and conduct survival analyses to determine whether antecedent medical conditions and medications present at diagnosis are associated with either shortened or prolonged survival with ALS. We will use survival analysis to determine whether there is an association between these conditions/medications and survival with ALS. This study will contribute significantly to the understanding of the role that metabolic factors, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease and autoimmunity play in the etiology and prognosis of ALS, and could lead to the development of new preventive or therapeutic interventions to prolong survival in ALS patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS: also known as Lou Gehrig's disease) is an adult-onset neuromuscular disorder that is the third most common neurodegenerative disease of aging (after Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases). It is critically important to identify modifiable risk factors present prior to diagnosis that affect the risk of developing ALS, and to also identify factors that are associated with the length of survival with this uniformly fatal disease. We hope that this study will identify modifiable risk factors that pu people at risk for ALS so that we can prevent this disabling disease, and we believe that studying the factors that influence length of survival with ALS will lead to the development of new preventive or therapeutic interventions to prolong survival among patients with ALS.",Antecedent Medical Conditions and Medications: Associations with the Risk and Prognosis ALS,9143771,R01TS000249,[' '],ATSDR,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,400000,-0.003884556757085822
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,9120230,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2016,425000,0.021406191647948748
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics.

"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9134892,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2016,563079,-0.0076851556761404725
"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,9049546,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Theory of Change', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'cognitive ability', 'concept mapping', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'data access', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'health service use', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'medication compliance', 'mobile computing', 'monitoring device', 'mood symptom', 'new technology', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'reduce symptoms', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,564995,0.004605882915236896
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.            ",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9026192,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Analgesics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical practice', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,578991,-0.02247147373551552
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9127532,R01NS097000,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Labyrinthine disorder', 'Learning', 'Leukocytes', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'gene discovery', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mRNA Expression', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'prospective', 'release factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2016,620686,0.01907081065555598
"Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is very difficult for nurses using current monitoring standards to know who will develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), when they will do so, and why, leading to imprecise nursing surveillance, and failure-to-rescue. We propose to expand on our prior machine learning (ML) techniques that continuously process complex data from disparate sources, and further develop a smart clinical decision support system (SDSS) to apply CRI detection algorithms to alert nurses to ongoing CRI events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting). Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).            ",Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2),9103405,R01NR013912,"['Active Learning', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Boxing', 'California', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nurses', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Qualifying', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staff Work Load', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'graphical user interface', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment response']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,656467,0.014085507623504934
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9029396,R01GM117622,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,662537,0.019162286823354174
"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.                ",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9028400,R01HL126700,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Apnea', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Pulse Rates', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Stratification', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'abstracting', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic health disparity', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'post stroke', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'stroke survivor', 'surveillance study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,767518,0.028037570847905497
"CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring ReThink Medical, Inc. proposes to develop an ambulatory version of the physiologic monitoring technology it validated in Phase I, the CorBand. The CorBand is designed to track key physiologic parameters that are predictive of cardiac decompensation, to detect the early stages of decompensation, and to relay both the physiologic data and generated alerts to relevant caregivers with the end goal of reducing hospitalizations by enabling proactive/preventative care in the heart failure population. Heart failure effects 5.8 million individuals in the US and the costs associated are approaching $40 billion annually. This technology will not only improve the quality of life for heart failure patients, but also help to reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that puts emphasis on preventative care through health monitoring technologies. Our specific aims include (1) manufacturing a robust version of the device for use in two large, long term, ambulatory studies. It will be validated using patients who have cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), activity levels, and fluid index derived from the CorBand will be compared with data collected from CIEDs manufactured by Medtronic and Boston Scientific and analyzed for correlation. (2) The CorBand will be deployed in a large ambulatory population of HF patients. We will collect the patient's clinical notes and note hospitalization events along with remote physiologic data from the CorBand. We will use this data to further build a predictive model for cardiac decompensation using a number of machine learning approaches. In aim (3), we will perform a controlled study on a population of HF patients. All the subjects will wear the CorBand; we will use the data from half the subjects to predict decompensation events, provide that information to subject's caregiver in order to provide preventative care. The other half will receive usual care. We will then examine the number of HF related hospitalizations in both groups to evaluate the ability of the CorBand to reduce hospitalizations. Our goal is to simplify the management of heart failure while improving the quality of care of the patients and reducing the associated costs. We will investigate the benefits of a novel, non-invasive multi-parameter sensor with telemetry for monitoring patients with heart failure combined with an algorithm for detecting early-stage cardiac decompensation with a goal of preventing hospitalizations.",CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring,9202845,R44HL125001,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Award', 'Boston', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cloud Service', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Edema', 'Electronics', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Office Visits', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Blind Study', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'clinical decision-making', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'heart rate variability', 'hemodynamics', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment group']",NHLBI,"RETHINK MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2016,1009410,0.017243691015740012
"Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination Project Summary / Abstract Between 1.6 and 3.8 million people each year suffer a mild TBI in the US alone. Reliable diagnosis and prompt treatments are vital to managing the often-serious short and long-term sequelae resulting from mild TBI. However, a reliable objective and accurate method for mild TBI diagnosis outside of a hospital setting, and in particular for determining RTP readiness, has eluded the clinical community. Current diagnosis and RTP assessments are based on patient symptoms, neurocognitive evaluations, and / or physical performance testing. Use of symptom scales are problematic for several reasons including subjectivity and reliability. Neurocognitive evaluations and physical tests (such as balance tests), although less subjective, require pre- injury baseline testing of subjects due to inherently large subject-to-subject variations in evaluation performances. Due to these reasons, current mild TBI diagnostic methods have limited applications and are not suitable for a significant majority of patients who suffer mild TBI. This project is aimed at developing an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI) based on physiologic changes in a patient after injury and providing a platform capable of RTP guidance. The method is based on quantification of well-known physiologic changes after a concussion, i.e. the impairment of autonomic function and altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured with transcranial Doppler (TCD). The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of a recently-developed analytical machine learning framework for the analysis of the CBF velocity (CBFV) waveforms. In contrast to previous methods used before, the proposed approach utilizes the entire shape of the complex CBFV waveform, thus obtaining subtle changes in blood flow that are lost in other analysis methods. Additionally, comprehensive verification between our platform and MRI will be performed following injury resulting in the first scientific experiments of this kind. The ultimate goal of this Phase II SBIR is to commercialize an objective and accurate software algorithm for reliable diagnosis and management of sports concussions which does not currently exist. The outcome will be a software suite integrated into existing TCD and will be marketed to emergency departments, neurology clinics, and other healthcare providers involved in mild TBI diagnosis and RTP management. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem in the United States contributing to a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability. Mild TBI concussions account for over 80% of all TBIs sustained and a major problem is the high rate of mis-diagnosis due to lack of objective measures and delayed onset of symptoms. This project aims to develop the first objective concussion evaluation method using a novel analysis platform that can obtain subtle, physiologic changes in cerebral hemodynamics. Successful completion of this project will result in a portable diagnostic device suitable for use in many scenarios where concussion diagnosis is inaccurate or unavailable today.",Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination,9202982,R44NS092209,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Blood Flow Velocity', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Concussion', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Study', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Readiness', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spin Labels', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'balance testing', 'base', 'brain health', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high school', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,"NEURAL ANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2016,1500000,-0.0071987392827626276
"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",9115219,R01HL127028,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anthropometry', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dyspnea', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise stress test', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Galectin 3', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Spirometry', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'aged', 'arterial stiffness', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'exercise intolerance', 'fasting glucose', 'fitness', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'pressure', 'screening', 'statistics', 'trend']",NHLBI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,1900214,0.012852903528924221
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.              ",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9083041,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Employment', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'aphasia recovery', 'aphasic', 'behavior test', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'fitness', 'hemisphere damage', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke survivor', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response', 'wasting']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2016,2291632,-0.04997221324951173
"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8897359,K23DK090304,"['Academy', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,37402,0.0030053587309862005
"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,9067635,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'cognitive ability', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'monitoring device', 'new technology', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,43567,0.004605882915236896
"Pancreatic cystic lesions: descriptive epidemiology and natural history DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cystic lesions: descriptive epidemiology and natural history.  A steady increase in incidence of pancreatic cysts has been documented and is related to widespread use of new imaging technologies, mainly CT and MRI. Incidental pancreatic cyst diagnosis ranges from 2.6% to 20% depending on imaging modality and population. The dilemma is that cysts with malignant potential account for ~50% of all cysts and have a d50% 5-year survival as invasive cancers. Yet, it is often unclear which cysts will progress partly due to the poorly understood epidemiology and natural history of these lesions. Further, regardless of malignant potential, current guidelines recommend either ""watch and wait"" or surgical resection with decisions based on cyst size, location, symptoms and patient eligibility for surgery. Cancer prevention is the goal of surgery but the significant morbidity and mortality associated with surgical resection cannot be ignored. Thus, continued research that contributes to finer sub-classification and diagnosis of cysts that are or will progress to cancer s needed to prevent unnecessary surgery, characterize high risk populations, improve prognosis and increase knowledge of the understudied natural history of these lesions. A secondary benefit is the potential that this work also will shed light on pancreatogenesis. Our aims are to: 1) Determine cyst lesion incidence in patients e40 years old who received an abdominal CT or MRI at UCSF from 1996-2015; 2) For cyst patients followed at UCSF, abstract prospective clinical and outcome data from medical, pathology and laboratory records to determine factors related to cyst progression/ malignancy and identify archival biospecimens for banking. Link pancreatic cyst patients with SEER cancer registry data to determine cancer outcomes and; 3) Frequency- match controls (no cyst) to cyst cases by 5-year age group, sex, reason for imaging and imaging modality to determine demographic and clinical factors related to pancreatic cyst risk. We expect to identify about 2,000 incident pancreatic cyst patients from review of ~50,000 studies. Descriptive statistics, adjusted multivariable Cox regression including with time-dependent covariates, and unconditional logistic regression analyses will be used to address the study aims. Achievement of our overarching goal, to develop a richly annotated database registry of abdominal imaging-identified (incidental and non-incidental) pancreatic cyst patients at UCSF, will enable further research of understudied factors related to risk and progression of pancreatic cysts and by type. More importantly, as public registries of pancreatic cysts do not exist, our project is well-positioned to build the infrastructure and resources for support of futue prospective cohorts to identify factors to 1) understand biological mechanisms contributing to cyst development; 2) predict progression and malignancy and; 3) better define at-risk groups for closer monitoring or intervention. A comprehensive understanding of pancreatic cyst epidemiology and natural history is of utmost importance to provide the best options for patient care and has the potential to add new data about early pancreatogenesis to inform screening and therapeutic targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diagnosis of pancreatic cysts has increased dramatically with the aging of the population and the widespread use of CT and MRI scans for clinical evaluation of a variety of conditions. At least 50% of these cysts have malignant potential, yet we cannot accurately predict which cysts harbor cancer or will progress to cancer because we have a limited understanding of factors that increase risk and explain pancreatic cyst development. Research to expand knowledge that clarifies how pancreatic cysts develop and who is at risk for malignant cystic lesions, will improve patient treatment and reduce the number of patients who undergo unnecessary surgical resection that carries risk of morbidity and mortality.",Pancreatic cystic lesions: descriptive epidemiology and natural history,8839737,R03CA179681,"['Abdomen', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'CA-19-9 Antigen', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Cyst', 'Cystic Lesion', 'Cystic Neoplasm', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Descriptive Epidemiology', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Excision', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Inherited', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Medical', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucinous', 'Mucinous Neoplasm', 'Natural History', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Ovarian Cysts', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Cyst', 'Pancreatitis', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Tubular formation', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal CT', 'abstracting', 'age group', 'aged', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer prevention', 'cohort', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'new growth', 'novel', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sex', 'standard care', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'trait']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2015,79188,-0.031240562454356535
"Predictors of Negative Outcomes Following Acute Care Encounters in Older Medicare DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergency department (ED) is an inherently high-risk setting, especially for older adults. EDs employ a rapid triage and evaluation system that may not capture the complex nature of a geriatric visit. The disposition plan of patients who visit an ED is to be directly discharged home, placed in observation care, or admitted to the hospital. There is mounting concern that recent increased use of observation care may also subject patients to a rapid diagnostic regiment with unknown utility. As older patients continue to rely on the ED and hospitals for their care, the potential for treatment that is not geriatric-oriented and results in undesirable outcomes shortly after discharge is high. A negative outcome within 7-days of discharge from an acute care encounter is temporally related to the visit and has important policy implications. The goal of this research program is to identify patients at risk for a short-term negative outcome, defined as either an inpatient admission or death, within 7 days of discharge from their acute care encounter. The proposal will utilize a randomly selected sample of 5% Medicare Claims data, which amounts to 2.4 million beneficiaries, of which patients age > 65 years who visit the ED in 2012 will be analyzed. The multi-disciplinary project team includes experts in health services research, geriatrics, emergency medicine, administrative claims data research, and statistics. In Aim 1, the study will assess predictors of ED disposition (discharge or observation care) following the ED visit. The team will then conduct a stratified analysis to identify predictors of negative outcomes following discharge from observation care (Aim 2) or the ED (Aim 3). The proposal will assess the association between two sets of primary predictors, ED discharge diagnosis codes developed by the PI as well as the recently created Medicare Chronic Conditions, and outcomes. Additional variables will include patient demographics, comorbidities, facility characteristics, prior inpatient utilization, skilled nursing facility usage, and community demographics. The analysis will include descriptive statistics, assessment for similarities and collinearity between the predictors, and hierarchical random effects logistic regression models pertaining to each Aim. All project aims have sufficient power to complete the analyses. The proposed study will identify characteristics of patients at risk for negative short-term outcomes following acute care encounters and will (1) provide population-level national data to understand negative outcomes following discharge, (2) serve as a foundation for future work in developing a post-discharge intervention that will reduce these events, and (3) help ED managers, geriatricians, and health policy experts develop national guidelines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Endstage kidney disease, the complete failure of the kidneys, is one of the most pressing medical problems of the developed world. Currently, the best treatment for endstage kidney disease is kidney transplantation, but the number of donor organs are limited, subjecting patients to hemodialysis and in many cases further complications and an early death. We have developed a new method that could be used to grow embryonic kidneys in the laboratory. These kidneys could then be transplanted to support the kidney function of the patient.",Predictors of Negative Outcomes Following Acute Care Encounters in Older Medicare,8926346,R03AG047862,"['18 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Comorbidity Index', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elderly', 'Embryo', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Hemodialysis', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ Donor', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'System', 'Transplantation', 'Triage', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cost', 'demographics', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'high risk', 'male', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'policy implication', 'population based', 'programs', 'statistics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2015,91665,0.02231751666381071
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8997225,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,94089,-0.0096962773834221
"Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an innovative relative risk model predicting incidence of complications in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients. Spine surgery is a rapidly growing area of health care expenditures; complications in spine surgery significantly add to health care spending and may impact patient outcomes. The elderly, as one of the priority populations studied in research funded by AHRQ, are more prone than are many other groups to perioperative complications. Poor understanding of complication incidence makes patient counseling and shared decision making difficult. Better understanding of how patient factors contribute to operative outcomes may significantly improve patient engagement in discussion of treatment options. Development of a clinical tool that may predict occurrence of complications in spine surgery would be an innovative and valuable addition to the practice of spine surgery. This effort will build upon developed measures incorporating patient comorbidities, choice of surgical approach, and pre-operative diagnosis into a model estimating risk of complication occurrence. The principle goal of our research effort has been to build optimized and validated predictive models of complications after spinal surgery. A retrospective database assessment will be conducted, using the Medicare and Marketscan databases. Statistical analysis of the databases will be used to generate an appropriate adverse event predictive model, where the impact of individual comorbidities and other patient and procedure factors contributing to higher complication incidence is assessed. The study will aggregate patient data into appropriate cohorts, and analyze the data with logistic regression, CART, and other modeling methods. The innovative goal of this investigation will be to predict both risk of any complication and occurrence of specific types of complications in spinal surgery. After a predictive tool has been developed, the measure will be applied prospectively to spinal surgery patients, where complications will be prospectively assessed by an independent auditor and correlated with recording of patient centered outcome metrics recorded concurrently in our clinic. Appreciation of how patient factors contribute to surgical outcomes will significantly improve patient education and aid informed decision making, may benefit patient care, and will contribute to implementation of comparative effectiveness relative risk adjustment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Spine surgery has consistently manifested significant growth and is a large source of health care spending; many spine surgery procedures are performed upon older, Medicare-aged patients. Helping patients understand the risks of operative interventions will improve patient education, contribute to realistic patient expectations of surgical outcomes, and will yield better quality of life for surgical candidates. This study will develop a patient-centered measure of the risk of perioperative adverse events in spine surgery, incorporating both Medicare and non-Medicare aged patients, and correlate this measure to patient reported quality of life measures.            ",Developing a patient-centered model of the risk of perioperative complications in spine surgery,9026947,R01HS023800,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,104080,0.016281139511524358
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8788442,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2015,129546,0.010776666566664227

She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8875578,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'diagnostic assay', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2015,137160,-0.005332178621049587
"NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although cervical cancer is preventable, it still continues to be a leading cause of death. Following the evidence- based guidelines for cervical cancer prevention is challenging for healthcare providers, due to which many patients do not receive the optimal preventive care. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems can potentially improve the care delivery. However, the current CDS systems only identify patients overdue for screening, and do not suggest the optimal screening interval. Moreover they do not help with surveillance of patients with abnormal screening results. This is because the existing systems lack the capability to process free- text clinical reports that contain information needed for applying the guidelines. Hence there is a critical need for natural language processing (NLP)-enabled CDS systems that can utilize discrete as well as free-text patient information for enhancing the decision support. Our long-term goal is to improve healthcare delivery of cervical cancer prevention with guideline based reminders. The central hypothesis is that NLP- enabled CDS system will significantly improve the quality of care delivery for cervical cancer prevention. The rationale is that use of NLP will improve granularity of the guideline implementation, which will in-turn enhance care delivery. As preliminary work we have developed an NLP-enabled CDS system that automatically interprets the patient information from the electronic health record and applies the national guidelines to compute the optimal recommendation for screening and surveillance. We have performed validation of the system in a non-clinical setting.1 In this application we will proceed towards deployment of the system in the clinical setting, and will carry out studies for measuring the impact on the quality of care delivery. In ai one, we will validate the system in the clinical setting and will optimize its usability and workflw integration. In aim two, we will test the hypothesis that reminders from the NLP-enabled CDS system to primary care providers will improve the quality of care delivery, by performing a one year intervention control study across four sites of a primary care practice. In aim three, we will test the hypothesis that reminders to non-adherent high-risk patients will improve their surveillance rates, by performing a randomized intervention study for three months. In this study, care coordinators will utilize the CDS system for sending reminders to patients that are non-adherent and at high risk due to abnormal screenings. The main contribution of this project will be knowledge about the effectiveness of NLP in enhancing the impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This project is innovative because the CDS system will utilize NLP to generate screening reminders for normal patients and surveillance reminders for patients with abnormal findings. This is a major advancement over existing systems that can only identify patients for screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield knowledge about the effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) to enhance impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This research will foster implementation of similar CDS systems across the nation for cervical cancer prevention and for other decision problems, which will improve the quality of healthcare delivery. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to AHRQ's mission to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.",NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance,8934087,R21HS022911,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2015,145229,-0.027484186081982873
"HYBRID ONTOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING BASED METHODS USING EMR DATA FOR EFFECTIVE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS); A SEPSIS CASE STUDY USING ICU DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our research is focused on the use of advanced ontological models as a foundation for computerized Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems that link hospitalized patient data routinely captured in electronic medical records (EMRs) with medical knowledge to effectively influence timely awareness and treatment choices by clinicians. Our phase 1 goal is to demonstrate how our advanced CDS technology has the potential to improve preventable mortality outcomes associated with sepsis in ICU patients. We distinguish two types of CDS algorithms available today for detecting and/or predicting sepsis using EMR data: 1) evidence-based ""knowledge-driven"" detection algorithms; and 2) data-driven ""predictive"" algorithms based on machine learning (ML) techniques. Recent studies indicate currently available CDS tools do not reduce risk of death in hospitalized patients. We believe this may be because diseases such as sepsis are time-sensitive, complex syndromes and also due to the challenges of computerized reuse of unstructured EMR data. Our sepsis ontology models this complexity to: a) provide enhanced knowledge-driven sepsis risk- stratified cohort classifications that help guide interventions; b) support accurate natural language processing (NLP) of free text clinical notes to enhance real-time sepsis risk detection; and c) improve the accuracy of data- driven prediction models when used in conjunction with ML training algorithms. Our CDS is based on proprietary cluster computing technology we call ""VFusion"" designed to efficiently deal with the generation and practical use of large, application domain-specific ontologies. Our sepsis ontology employs a family of upper level ontologies, combined with granular evidence-based domain ontologies, configurable rule sets (e.g. first order logic-based), and required components of reference terminologies. Our research will use openly available ICU patient data to establish statistical detection/prediction performance metrics using this ontology in 2 modes of use: 1) as a knowledge-based screening tool to detect subtle signs of sepsis in individualized hospitalized patients; 2) used in conjunction with ML to improve data-driven predictive performance. We will measure specificity/sensitivity, and positive/negative predictive power of our hybrid ontology-based technology to demonstrate dramatically improved performance over existing CDS algorithms. In Phase II we plan a retrospective demonstration with a much larger sample of patients to include non-ICU patients in collaboration with a major healthcare system. Our product vision is an early inpatient sepsis detection algorithm with high accuracy embodied as a ""plug-in application"" compatible with any modern EMR platform in use at a client hospital effective in both ICU and non-ICU care settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Even with the advent of powerful, new computer medical record technologies used in hospitals, the risk of death has not been reduced in hospitalized patients. The goal of this research effort is to combine medical record systems with advanced cognitive technologies that are commonly used today in products such as the iPhone ""Siri"" to improve clinician awareness and decisions that will dramatically reduce preventable mortality. Our initial use case will be the management of sepsis--=the leading cause of death in non-coronary intensive care units in hospitals                ",HYBRID ONTOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING BASED METHODS USING EMR DATA FOR EFFECTIVE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS); A SEPSIS CASE STUDY USING ICU DATA,9046860,R43LM012291,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mortality Determinants', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plug-in', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool']",NLM,"COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2015,149100,0.012673680041820958
"Rapid Detection of Common Failure Modes for Knee Prosthetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bruin Biometrics' proposes to develop the Joint Health Monitor (JHM), an innovative low risk device capable of detecting artificial joint implant failure prior to all currently available diagnostic devices. Artificial joint replacements have demonstrated excellent clinical performance. However, failures do occur due to a multitude of factors including, aseptic loosening, wear, dislocation, osteolysis, and adverse local tissue reactions (ALTR), including pseudotumors and extensive tissue damage. Recent catastrophic failures associated with specific implant designs, and increasing concern over the severe clinical consequences of ALTR, have raised the attention of both consumer advocacy groups and regulatory agencies, in the US and abroad. It is evident that current diagnostic tools have failed to predict early enough complications associated with some implant designs and/or patient's characteristics. Rather than be predictive, current diagnostic methods usually do not detect joint degradation until bone and tissue damage have already occurred, increasing morbidity, mortality and severity of revision surgeries. Bruin Biometrics has developed an innovative monitoring device that will allow effective monitoring of an artificial joint functionality and eary detection of at risk patients, implant designs and reduction of the number or at least the severity of revision surgeries. Early detection should also enable physicians to prescribe exercise regimens, dietary supplements, medication, early revision surgery or other measures to protect against further damage. Moreover, the existence of an effective monitoring device would provide invaluable feedback, enabling unprecedented quantification and evaluation of treatment efficacy including drugs. The objectives of this proposal are to demonstrate the technical feasibility of this device to detect specific failure modes. This will be accomplished using an in vitro test rig set up and an in vivo human subject pilot study. Our overall goal is to rapidly delier a wearable system capable of monitoring the status of artificial joints and provide surgeons with more accurate and earlier diagnoses.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Hip and Knee replacement procedures will continue to increase dramatically over the next twenty years and the rate of revision surgery is expected to remain stable around 17-18%. This will increase the burden on orthopaedic surgeons, operating room capacity, and healthcare cost. In 2007 dollars, this volume of total joint replacement would generate costs exceeding $100 billion, or 1% of the gross domestic product (GDP). If successful, the new monitoring device object of this proposal named ""Joint Health Monitor"" will have an immediate impact on managing joint degradation, reducing complicated revision surgeries and allowing more effective patient surveillance avoiding catastrophic failure; this in turn will increase patient confidence in regulatory agencies and industry.            ",Rapid Detection of Common Failure Modes for Knee Prosthetics,8906609,R43AR067048,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arithmetic', 'Attention', 'Biometry', 'Bone Tissue', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consumer Advocacy', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discrimination', 'Dislocations', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hip region structure', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Prosthesis', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteolysis', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Prosthesis', 'Radiation', 'Reaction', 'Regimen', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Trust', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adverse outcome', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'follow-up', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'human subject', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'public health relevance', 'rapid detection', 'sample fixation', 'tool']",NIAMS,"BRUIN BIOMETRICS, LLC",R43,2015,149685,0.004697891752726061
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8849802,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,156324,-0.019878059715930322
"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization. Given the rapidly rising numbers of patients with dementia, reducing potentially preventable hospitalization could have an enormous impact on public health.",Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms,8911756,K08AG048321,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Bioinformatics', 'Capsicum', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kale - dietary', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleeplessness', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'behavior change', 'career', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'geriatric mental health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'neuropsychiatry', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2015,175103,0.0023460273896311794
"Novel whole-genome analysis methods for Alzheimer's risk prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) affects millions of elderly people in the United States, yet there are no well-established clinical guidelines for assessing a person's relative risk. Accurate assessment of lifetime risk for LOAD would give high-risk individuals the opportunity to undergo regular biomarker screening for signs of disease and to modify environmental risk factors or participate in prospective clinical trials. This Phase I SBIR project aims to develop a risk prediction model for LOAD that meets or exceeds the accuracy standards established in 1998 by the Working Group for Biochemical and Molecular Markers of Alzheimer's Disease. The recent release of whole-genome sequence data from an extensively phenotyped cohort of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative creates a unique opportunity to develop the methodology needed to successfully construct such a risk prediction model. The Parabon team will undertake three specific aims in pursuit of the final goal of producing a risk prediction model that can be used in the clinic. First, a novel methodology will be created for analyzing whole-genome sequence data to discover common SNPs, rare variants, and epistatic interactions that significantly associate with LOAD endophenotypes, the specific physiological changes that underlie disease. This will require innovative algorithm and software development, particularly the implementation of multi-objective optimization in our existing evolutionary search algorithm for detecting epistasis. Second, the discovered significant variants will be built into risk prediction models for each endophenotype using state-of-the-art machine learning methods. These models will then be combined into a single predictive model for lifetime risk, which will be validated in an independent cohort from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. Finally, to quantify the confidence associated with each prediction made by the model, algorithms and software for calculating confidence intervals will be developed and implemented. Each new prediction will be presented with a measure of confidence to enable clinicians to determine what, if any, intervention is necessary. When these aims have been completed, Parabon will have produced the first clinically relevant genetic risk prediction model for late-onset Alzheimer's Disease, as well as a suite of software that can be used in the development of other diagnostics. In Phase II, we will move beyond the ADNI-supplied endophenotypes, using image processing and deep learning to infer neuroimaging features most relevant to AD diagnoses, as well as work to validate the predictive models in a larger, more diverse cohort across multiple sites.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This Phase I SBIR aims to develop a highly accurate predictive model for lifetime risk of late-onset Alzheimer's Disease to enable early identification of high-risk individuals for participation in clinical trials and regular screening for signs of disease. In pursuit of this goal, the Parabon team will develop algorithms and software to build a novel methodology for the analysis of whole-genome sequence data and endophenotype measures from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.                ",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9044236,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'portability', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,190216,0.02878273063571022
"Multiparametric Prediction of Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) affects an estimated 14.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States, and is a substantial burden on health care resources, because it can cause long-term functional and cognitive disability. Much of this is due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) from vasospasm (VSP). VSP refers to the reactive narrowing of cerebral blood vessels due the unusual presence of blood surrounding the vessel. In its extreme, severe VSP precludes blood flow to brain tissue, resulting in stroke.  SAH is one of the most common disease entities treated in the Neurointensive Care Unit (NICU). Currently, resource planning is scripted around the Modified Fisher Scale, which predicts the odds ratio of developing DCI based on the volume and pattern of blood on initial brain computed tomography (CT). It does not, however, allow for further individualized risk assessments. The first 14 days are occupied by efforts to detect preclinical or early VSP and arrange timely interventions to prevent permanent injury. The only noninvasive tool supported by guidelines to potentially identify preclinical VSP is the transcrania Doppler (TCD), which has an unreliable range of sensitivity and negative predictive values, and is at the mercy of technician availability. If not identified preclinically, VSP must be detected once it is symptomatic and is then dependent on quality and availability of expertise in the complex and diurnal environment of the ICU.  Promisingly, electronic medical record (EMR) data and continuous physiology monitors offer abundant opportunities to risk stratify for future events as well as reveal events in real-time in the acutely brain injured patient. A methodical approach to feature engineering will be performed over a large set of potentially discriminatory data-driven and knowledge-based features. Meta-features representing variations and trends in time series variables will be extracted using a variety of quantitative and symbolic abstraction techniques. Predictive modeling will be performed using Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.  This project will result in a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision in VSP classification. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the potentia of underutilized EMR and physiological data to predict neurological decline. Generating accurate and timely prediction rules from already collected clinical data would be cost effective and have implications not only for SAH patients, but also for almost any monitored patient in any ICU. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will explore the optimal methods for creating a prediction tool that improves timeliness and precision of diagnosis. It will fill an important gap in the understanding of the underutilized potential of electronic medical record and high frequency device monitor data.

"Identification of patients with diabetes at high risk for treatment failure ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this project is to improve quality of care of patients with diabetes by identifying patients who may have particular difficulty reaching treatment targets and who could therefore potentially benefit from additional resources. Investigators propose to achieve this goal by developing a technology to accurately identify patients at high risk for not reaching blood glucose target to enable cost-effective implementation of resource-intensive interventions that improve glycemic control in high-risk individuals.  Improving blood glucose control in patients with diabetes could both improve their quality of life by reducing diabetes complications and decrease costs. Some patients that face particularly high barriers to glucose control may benefit from additional resources that are too expensive to apply to broad patient populations. However, it is not currently possible to identify patients at high risk not being able to reach blood glucose targets with sufficient accuracy to make these interventions cost-effective.  One reason for this is that a large fraction of critical information about the patients' functional status, social circumstances and other important factors that may present barriers to glucose control is only found in narrative documents, from which it is difficult to extract. Furthermore, the amount of information about any single patient i the medical record is enormous, and is impossible to process efficiently using standard analytical algorithms such as regression analysis.  In the proposed project investigators will combine two novel technologies - natural language processing of electronic provider notes and artificial intelligence technology Dynamic Logic - to help circumvent these challenges to build a high-accuracy model of risk of not being able to reach blood glucose targets in patients with diabetes. Natural language processing will identify key concepts documented in the provider notes and will help translate their text into a compendium of facts about the patient. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will therefore allow to greatly increasing the number of factors / variables that can be considered for the models for prediction of failure to reach glucose control, and ultimately improve their accuracy. Consequently this translational multidisciplinary project will both advance our understanding of the risk factors for not being able to reach glucose control for patients with diabetes and assist in real-life implementation of interventions that can help lower their blood glucose, decrease the rate of diabetes complications, improve the patients' quality of life and help control the rising costs of healthcare.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Lowering blood glucose of patients with diabetes could both improve their quality of life and reduce healthcare costs, but may be more difficult for some patients than others. Patients who have particularly high barriers to blood glucose control could benefit from extra resources, but it can be challenging to identify them in advance. In this projec the investigators will combine advanced computational technologies including artificial intelligence and natural language processing to identify patients with diabetes at high risk for difficulty lowering blood glucose to help make commitment of additional resources cost-effective.                ",Identification of patients with diabetes at high risk for treatment failure,8902473,R41DK105612,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Glucose', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Epidemic', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Language', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuropathy', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Failure', 'analytical method', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'combinatorial', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'functional status', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'social']",NIDDK,LP INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,R41,2015,223336,0.005986211018350094
"Advanced retinal image analysis for AMD screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this grant application we propose to develop a screening tool for Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - the single largest cause for legal blindness among aged Americans. A robust screening test that can be performed by a primary care physician or an optometrist, who can then refer the patient to an ophthalmologist, will be a useful first step in casting a wider net and helping reduce the toll of severe vision loss with timely intervention and patient education.  Large, multi-center studies Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and AREDS2 have shown that vitamin supplements along with minerals and antioxidants slow progression of the disease in patients with intermediate AMD, and those with late AMD in one eye. Identifying the at-risk population for advanced AMD who might benefit from the supplements in a timely manner is a growing problem with the aging baby boomers. The proposed tool, EyeSeeAMD, will analyze color retinal fundus images from a patient, automatically detect the various pathologies associated with AMD, quantify them and recommend if the patient needs to be referred to an expert for further evaluation. We have promising preliminary results in drusen detection, detailed plans for developing the envisioned device, and excellent clinical, research, and engineering teams to guarantee success of the project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed tool, EyeSeeAMD, will help in triaging age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients who are at higher risk to progress to late AMD by providing an automated method for screening the growing aged-population in a non-invasive manner.

"Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. CDI, which disproportionately affects older adults, can result in fulminant, life-threatening colitis and lead to multiple recurrnt episodes. There is an urgent need for validated biomarker-based clinical decision-making tools to predict which patients will experience adverse outcomes from CDI. There is a gap in knowledge regarding which known and yet to-be-discovered biomarkers, derived from the host, microbiome and pathogen, will best predict complications and recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate accurate risk-prediction models for adverse outcomes following CDI that can be used to guide therapy. The next step in pursuit of that goal, and our overall objective for the proposed research, is to discover new candidate biomarkers and determine which ones together best predict complicated CDI in an adjusted model. Our central hypothesis is that a biomarker-based model will better predict complicated CDI compared to models based on clinical variables alone. To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims: 1) validate host biomarkers previously shown to associate with complicated CDI; 2) discover novel microbial biomarkers for complicated CDI; and 3) develop a candidate biomarker-based predictive model for complicated CDI. We will collect sera and stool prospectively in a cohort of older adults to determine if characteristics of the microbiome, microbial features of C. difficile, levels of antitoxin antibodies, and/or inflammatory mediators associate with complications. Multivariable models will be constructed using linear regression and machine learning techniques and model diagnostics will be used to generate a final portable, biomarker-based predictive model for use in future studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. We currently lack a complete understanding as to why certain patients with CDI progress to severe disease with increased complications, including death, while others recover. Our research proposes to discovery objective, readily obtainable indicators from serum/stool that predict adverse outcomes from CDI early after initial disease onset. It is envisioned that this could lead to a paradigm-shift in management by directing specific treatment strategies, including more costly therapeutics such as antibody treatment, fecal transplant and newer antibiotics, towards patients who would most benefit. This research takes the first steps towards development of a biomarker-based predictive tool to aid clinicians in treatment decisions.            ",Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection,8987064,R21AI120599,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antitoxins', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Biological Markers', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Colon', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor', 'Infection', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Loop ileostomy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Serum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxin', 'Transplantation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'high risk', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'procalcitonin', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'secondary outcome', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2015,232500,0.003575393410879698
"Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Patients often have poor access to screening and vaccination, and present in advanced stages, for which chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of failure and toxicity. Although intensifying chemotherapy can improve tumor control and survival, toxicity is often unacceptably high. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoRT are therefore needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue. In contrast, image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) is a modern technique that maximizes target dose and minimizes normal tissue dose. Multiple studies have found that IG-IMRT can significantly reduce organ dose and reduce toxicity compared to standard RT. These studies support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT can permit delivery of more intensive chemotherapy. For example, gemcitabine, a potent radiosensitizer, has been found to improve survival for cervical cancer patients in randomized trials (Dueñas-Gonzalez et al.). However, the toxicity when delivered with standard RT is extreme (>80% grade 3-4 toxicity). Therefore, this regimen has not replaced cisplatin alone as the standard of care. In contrast, our research group has found that the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine was increased when given with IG-IMRT. A large international multi-institutional trial has also found lower rates of toxicity with IG-IMRT compare to standard chemoRT. These findings support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT, by reducing bowel and bone marrow dose, could permit delivery of more effective concurrent chemotherapy. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for many pelvic malignancies. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial.  CVM-1421 is an emerging NCI-funded randomized phase II trial within the NRG Oncology Cooperative Group that will test the hypothesis that adding concurrent triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, to concurrent cisplatin and RT can improve outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced cervix cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation. This trial presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of IG- IMRT on normal tissue toxicity, as it will be the first cooperative group trial to permit IG-IMRT in this population. This trial also presents an opportunity to study ways to improve IG-IMRT quality, as there has been considerable controversy in how to optimally design IG-IMRT plans, due to their increased complexity. The goal of our research is to study the effect of IG-IMRT on toxicity, quality of life, and treatment outcomes, under varying intensities of chemotherapy. We will also implement a novel technique called knowledge-based planning (KBP) in order to improve plan quality and achieve optimal IG-IMRT dose distributions. This research could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care for pelvic malignancies, and will lay groundwork for future studies testing novel technologies in clinical trial settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) will reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without triapine. We are in an optimal situation to ask this question because the randomized phase II trial that will set the background for our study is evaluating the efficacy of more intensive chemotherapy while allowing both IG-IMRT and standard radiation treatment techniques. It would be beneficial for clinicians and patients to know whether IG-IMRT will reduce toxicity and improve quality of life. Further, this study could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care.            ",Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421,8948940,R01CA197059,"['American', 'Anterior', 'Bone Marrow', 'Boxing', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Modeling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Population', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitor', 'Secondary to', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'gastrointestinal', 'gemcitabine', 'image guided', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'new technology', 'novel', 'oncology', 'phase I trial', 'phase II trial', 'public health relevance', 'radiation effect', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,253619,-0.026181322934763676
"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI. Such an assay would reduce the interval between the onset of CDI symptoms and diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment of patients with CDI, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in patients without CDI, and decreasing healthcare-based transmission of this common, life-threatening infection.            ",Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection,8954018,R21AI119692,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Air', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diarrhea', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exotoxins', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Gases', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Odors', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proliferating', 'Provider', 'Pseudomembranous Colitis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic Megacolon', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Tube', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air sampling', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'forest', 'innovation', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2015,266063,-0.030022137304976357
"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted. Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Accelerating the pace at which patients are recruited into clinical trials has the potential for improving the speed at which new treatments are made available to the public.",An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records,8906937,R01LM011116,"['Address', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'falls', 'health record', 'improved', 'screening']",NLM,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,297811,0.003646506878348264
"Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contradiction of early cancer detection is that while some benefit others receive a detrimental diagnosis. A definitive example is mammography and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS, which most frequently presents as a non-palpable lesion, was rarely detected before the advent of modern mammography. Since 1983 there has been a 290% increase in DCIS incidence in women under 50 and 500% in those over 50. Given that only 5-10% of DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer with a 10-year mortality rate of 1-2%, DCIS experts suggest breast conservation for the majority of patients. However, these women continue to be overtreated with mastectomy and radiation, at rates comparable to those with invasive cancer. The inability to discern those at low vs. high risk is due in part to non-reproducible study results as well as inadequate statistical methods for risk prediction and validation.  We have collected a population-based DCIS cohort with the goal of delineating those women least likely to recur with invasive cancer and, hence, appropriate candidates for less aggressive treatments. Recently we established risk indices and published the corresponding absolute risk estimates for type of recurrence. However, two features of the study design, namely the presence of competing risks and the use of a stratified case-cohort design, constrained us to using crude empirical methods for analysis and left us unable to validate the clinical utility of our models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a unified, principled statistical framework for building, selecting, and evaluating clinically relevant risk indices, permitting refinement and validation of existing risk prediction models in our DCIS study as well as beyond.  We face multiple challenges including how to objectively build risk indices with relevant variables; how to estimate the corresponding risks (competing or not) in various subsample study designs; and, how to validate the resulting risk prediction models. Recently, we developed partDSA, a tree-based method which affords tremendous flexibility in building predictive models and provides an ideal foundation for developing a clinician- friendly tool for accurate stratification and risk prediction. In its curret form, partDSA is unable to estimate absolute risk in the presence of competing risks accounting for subsample study designs. Here we extend partDSA for such clinically relevant scenarios (Aim 1). We also propose aggregate learning for risk prediction to increase prediction accuracy and subsequently to build more stable but easily interpretable risk models (Aim 2). Finally, we propose the necessary methods for validating the resulting models (Aim 3).  Our proposal has two immediate public health benefits: first, these novel statistical methods will result in a clinician-friendly, publicly available tool for accurate risk prediction, stratification and validaion in numerous clinical settings; second, current DCIS risk models will be refined and validated with the expectation of better delineating those at low risk, hence strong candidates for conservative treatments including active surveillance.          Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.

"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8920543,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2015,335210,-0.017666398268290882
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,8896079,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'human Huntingtin protein', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2015,339691,-0.023771173722246432
"Antecedent Medical Conditions and Medications: Associations with the Risk and Prognosis ALS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ALS affects people in middle to late ages, during a time of life where it is common to suffer from more than one health problem, yet there is little understanding of the effect of chronic medical conditions and medication use on susceptibility to ALS. There is mounting concern and recent evidence that certain medical conditions and medications are associated with an increased risk of developing ALS, while other conditions and medications appear to be inversely associated with ALS risk. We propose to investigate the role of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, as well as the drugs used to treat these disorders, as both risk and prognostic factors for ALS. This study has three specific aims: Aim 1, to investigate the association between antecedent medical conditions and the risk of developing ALS; Aim 2, to examine the relationship between certain classes of medication and the risk of developing ALS; and Aim 3, to determine whether medical conditions or medications present at diagnosis of ALS adversely or positively affect survival with ALS. We will assemble a retrospective cohort of Medicare beneficiaries who were continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare (Parts A, B and D) during the years 2006 through 2014. To address aims 1 and 2, we will conduct a nested case-control study to identify newly diagnosed (incident) patients with ALS in this cohort between 2008 and 2014 using a modified version of the case definition algorithm used by the National ALS Registry. We expect to identify 11,000 incident ALS cases. Using incidence density sampling, ten age- and sex-matched controls will be randomly chosen for each case from among Medicare beneficiaries who entered the Medicare cohort in the same year as the case, but had who had no codes for ALS, MND or closely related conditions prior to their matched cases' diagnosis dates. We will use Medicare inpatient, outpatient, and laboratory health claims to document the occurrence of metabolic, cardiovascular, and autoimmune conditions among the study subjects both before and after the diagnosis of ALS. The availability of Part D (pharmaceutical) claims for Medicare beneficiaries from 2006 onward will provide the opportunity to examine the association of commonly used medications with the risk and prognosis of ALS. We will use conditional logistic regression analyses to identify premorbid medical conditions and medications associated with the risk of developing ALS. To address specific aim 3, we will link the data from our incident ALS case group to mortality data and conduct survival analyses to determine whether antecedent medical conditions and medications present at diagnosis are associated with either shortened or prolonged survival with ALS. We will use survival analysis to determine whether there is an association between these conditions/medications and survival with ALS. This study will contribute significantly to the understanding of the role that metabolic factors, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease and autoimmunity play in the etiology and prognosis of ALS, and could lead to the development of new preventive or therapeutic interventions to prolong survival in ALS patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS: also known as Lou Gehrig's disease) is an adult-onset neuromuscular disorder that is the third most common neurodegenerative disease of aging (after Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases). It is critically important to identify modifiable risk factors present prior to diagnosis that affect the risk of developing ALS, and to also identify factors that are associated with the length of survival with this uniformly fatal disease. We hope that this study will identify modifiable risk factors that pu people at risk for ALS so that we can prevent this disabling disease, and we believe that studying the factors that influence length of survival with ALS will lead to the development of new preventive or therapeutic interventions to prolong survival among patients with ALS.            ",Antecedent Medical Conditions and Medications: Associations with the Risk and Prognosis ALS,9048445,R01TS000249,[' '],ATSDR,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,400000,-0.003884556757085822
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8892263,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,413392,-0.0096962773834221
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,8915498,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2015,419993,0.021406191647948748
"Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) prevalence has increased and will continue so over the next 30 years with a profound individual and societal burden. Early detection of HF may be useful in mitigating this burden. The purpose of this proposal is to develop robust predictive models that make use of longitudinal electronic health record (EHR). Our long term goal is to use such models to detect HF at an earlier stage (e.g., AHA/ACA Stages A or B) than usually occurs in primary care. We have completed extensive preliminary work using 10 years of longitudinal EHR data on primary care patients. Using text mining and machine learning tools we have found that Framingham criteria are documented in the EHR long before more specific diagnostic studies are done. These symptoms are considerably more common among incident HF cases than controls two to four years before diagnosis. Moreover, clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and other data routinely captured in the EHR predicts future HF diagnosis. We propose to extend this work on early detection of HF with the following aims: 1) To develop more sensitive and specific criteria for use of Framingham HF signs and symptoms in the early detection of HF. We have shown that positive and negative affirmation of Framingham signs and symptoms are useful in HF detection 1-4 years before diagnosis. We propose to address the following: a) Which Framingham signs and symptoms and combinations thereof are most useful for early detection? b) Are there temporal sequences and correlations among signs and symptoms that improve accuracy of detection? c) How do the criteria vary by HF subtype? We hypothesize that analysis of routinely documented signs and symptoms data will yield a clinically meaningful improvement in the accuracy of detecting HF 1 to 2 years before actual diagnosis; 2) To determine the differential improvement in accuracy of predicting diagnosis of HF by combining common fixed field EHR data with text data to improve early detection of HF. Our preliminary work indicates that longitudinal EHR data (e.g., clinical, laboratory, health behaviors, diagnoses, use of care, etc) are useful in predicting future HF diagnosis. Based on these findings, we recognize an increasingly sophisticated analysis will be required to identify how to use these data to optimize predictive power. We hypothesize that the specific models and the performance of these models will vary by HF subtypes of HF; 3) To determine how digital ECG related measures can be used alone and in combination with other data to improve early detection of HF. Real time access to digital ECG data affords unique opportunities to extract a diversity of measures that may be useful in primary care in the early detection of HF; and 4) To develop preliminary operational protocols for early detection of HF in primary care. We will need to consider how the output from the model can be used to support clinical guidance and shared decision-making. Moreover, models need to be developed for data rich and data poor settings. The long term goal of the proposed work is relevant to the national priority for adoption of EHRs in clinical practice and for meaningful use of such technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart Failure (HF) strikes one in 5 US citizens over age 40, has a profound impact on health, and is almost always detected too late to allow doctors to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. We propose to use sophisticated analytic tools to search through electronic health records of patients for early signals of HF. The long term goal of our work is to use such tools to detect HF early enough to allow doctors to change the course of disease and substantially reduce HF morbidity and the risk of death.",Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care,8824963,R01HL116832,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee Strikes', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'body system', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid growth', 'shared decision making', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trend']",NHLBI,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R01,2015,461213,0.01426818366234703
"Predicting Hip Fracture Using a Biomechanical Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hip fractures are a significant cause of disability and mortality in older persons. The most common tool for diagnosis of osteoporosis and prediction of fracture risk is bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual- energy X-ray absorptiometry. Yet, up to half of individuals suffering a hip fracture do not have osteoporosis by BMD testing; thus alternative approaches to fracture risk assessment are needed. This underscores the importance of looking for additional contributors to fracture risk, such as reduced soft tissue thickness at the trochanter, which attenuates the fall forces that may lead to fracture. According to biomechanical principles, when the ratio of applied force to bone strength, (termed the 'Factor-of-Risk'), exceeds one, a fracture will occur. Two previous studies have examined the Factor-of-Risk along with trochanteric soft tissue thickness but had only small numbers of hip fractures, and conflicting results. To better understand the factors associated with hip fracture, we propose to use a biomechanical approach to assess hip fracture risk that includes both estimated forces applied to the hip during a sideways fall as well as the strength of the proximal femur. The specific goal is to investigate the contribution of trochanteric soft tissue thickness t hip fracture risk, and to include this in the biomechanical Factor-of-Risk model. We hypothesize these factors predict hip fracture, and further that the factor-of-risk prediction of hip fracture isk will prove better than BMD assessment alone and better than the World Health Organization FRAX tool. We will identify prospectively ascertained hip fracture cases from three cohorts (Framingham Study, MrOS, Rancho Bernardo Study) and from each cohort also select up to four sex- and age-matched (within 3-years) non-fracture cohort members as controls, using the case-cohort study design to increase efficiency. Soft tissue thickness in 2,435 individuals will be assess on whole body DXA scans obtained at the earliest time in each cohort before any subsequent hip fracture occurred. Relative risks will be assessed as odds ratios using conditional logistic regression. This study has potential to significantly alter the way hip fractue risk is currently being assessed, and thus how patients are selected for drug therapy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The most common tool to diagnose osteoporosis/predict hip fracture risk is bone density testing, and yet, up to half of adults suffering a hip fracture do no have osteoporosis by this test; thus alternative approaches to fracture risk assessment are needed. We will investigate the role of trochanteric soft tissue thickness to hip fracture risk, an include this in the biomechanical Factor-of-Risk model, to examine if they will predict hip fracture and further do so better than currently available prediction tools, providing new public health insights",Predicting Hip Fracture Using a Biomechanical Approach,8829750,R01AR060816,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Femur', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hip Fractures', 'Hip region structure', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menopause', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Smoking Status', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trochanters', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'absorption', 'base', 'bone strength', 'cohort', 'diagnosis standard', 'disability', 'falls', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'men', 'mortality', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'tool']",NIAMS,HEBREW REHABILITATION CENTER FOR AGED,R01,2015,473892,-0.014621655097073437
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry. This research is expected to impact the clinical management of AAA disease, as well as the pre-surgical planning capabilities of vascular and endovascular aneurysm repair.            ",Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,8888896,R01HL121293,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Aneurysm', 'Award', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pressure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'repaired', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2015,514370,0.0010011231029669271
"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,8892258,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'cognitive ability', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'monitoring device', 'new technology', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,525858,0.004605882915236896
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,8839318,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,577490,-0.02075642115147882
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.            ",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,8963132,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2015,593802,-0.0076851556761404725
"Worcester Heart Attack Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This population-based study proposes to continue the examination of changing long-term trends in the descriptive epidemiology of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and out-of hospital deaths due to coronary heart disease (CHD) in residents of the Worcester, MA, metropolitan area. The specific objectives of this population- based study are to examine contemporary (2013 and 2015), as compared with prior (1975-2011), trends in the annual incidence and attack rates of AMI, hospital and post-discharge survival rates, management practices, and out-of-hospital deaths attributed to CHD. To accomplish these and several additional secondary study objectives, this investigation will be carried out in the 11 acute care general hospitals providing care for residents of central Massachusetts. All new (incident) and recurrent episodes of definite AMI occurring in greater Worcester residents during 2013 and 2015 will be identified from discharge diagnostic printouts obtained from all metropolitan Worcester hospitals of patients with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of AMI and related CHD rubrics. The medical records of these patients will be individually reviewed for validation purposes according to pre-established criteria for AMI. Abstraction of the medical records of patients satisfying the study diagnostic and geographic eligibility criteria will be carried out by trained physicians with the recording of demographic, clinical, treatment, and outcomes related data. A review of records for additional hospitalizations and a search of death certificates will be carried out to examine the long-term survival status of discharged hospital patients from each of the proposed 2 study years, as well as those identified previously, through 2017. Death certificates will be reviewed to identify cases of out-of-hospital deaths attributed to CHD occurring during 2013 and 2015. In addition, we will assess the feasibility of carrying out an innovative approach for ""real time"" surveillance of acute coronary disease in this central MA population through the development of natural language processing systems that will automatically extract clinical information from electronic medical records in our most recently hospitalized patient cohort in 2015. Monitoring contemporary trends in our principal study outcomes remains timely given the ongoing publication and dissemination of treatment guidelines and recommendations by national agencies and emphasis on improving quality in processes of care. Given the ""real world"" setting of this investigation, important contemporary insights would be provided into current gaps between ideal and achieved patient care in the broader community setting, to assist in the development of novel educational approaches and incentives to provide more optimal patient care. The results of this investigation will provide important insights from a 40 year (1975-2015) vantage point about the magnitude of, mortality from, and treatment approaches used in the management of the nation's leading cause of death as it affects residents of a large New England metropolitan area. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of the proposed community-based study will provide data about 40 year trends with regards to the changing magnitude of, and outcomes associated with, heart attacks in residents of a large central New England community.

"Technology Application to Enhance Discharge Referral Decision Support DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decreasing readmissions through better discharge planning (DP) and transitional care is a national healthcare priority. RightCare Solutions has leveraged over 10 years of interdisciplinary academic research led by a nurse researcher, and through our highly successful phase one SBIR grant demonstrated market value for the D2S2 product and the technical expertise of our team. The D2S2 is a six-item decision support tool installed by RightCare Solutions in the hospital EHR to assist discharge planners to identify high-risk patients upon admission allowing time and focus to target appropriate transitional and post-acute care to prevent readmissions. We have achieved outstanding outcomes from our phase 1 award and are proposing further technological developments to enhance our commercial launch. The market potential for the D2S2 tool is significant since discharge decision support is estimated to be applicable to roughly 6,500 U.S. hospitals with a census that is 60% older adults equaling 14 million discharges per year. The phase 1 results indicate a significant impact on 30 and 60 day readmissions giving us strong evidence as to the value of the product. However, the results and our experience using the software indicate there is opportunity to enhance the product's accruacy and functionality. We propose to enhance our predictive accuracy through innovative data mining and machine learning techniques and to improve the functionality by electronically connecting the acute and post-acute care settings. Due to implementation in the three hospitals of the University of Pennsylvania Health System we have data on over 6,000 patients and through the continued live implementation we will accumulate data on over 25,000 patients by the start of the phase 2 grant. Using existing, and new data generated from continued operations, this proposed SBIR grant will advance the product in two major ways to enhance the commercial benefit to its users. Aim 1: Develop, test, and scale SMART capabilities, a dynamic process for improving prediction accuracy, by using hospital-specific and patient level characteristics (D2S2 variables and additional clinical and non-clinical characteristics) and modern data mining/machine learning techniques. AIM 2: Operationalize the D2S2 recommendations by electronically connecting high-risk patients with post-acute care (PAC) providers and stakeholders, known as CONNECT capabilities. Called a ""learning health system"" the end- product of this SBIR grant will provide continuous evaluation and improvement to the end-user measured against their goals. Our innovative design produces a closed-loop system that will use data from the D2S2 and hospital databases over time to ""get smarter.""

"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.                ","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",8864355,R01HL127028,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anthropometry', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dyspnea', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Exercise stress test', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Galectin 3', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Spirometry', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'aged', 'arterial stiffness', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'fasting glucose', 'fitness', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'novel', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'statistics', 'trend']",NHLBI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,1974550,0.012852903528924221
"Pancreatic cystic lesions: descriptive epidemiology and natural history     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cystic lesions: descriptive epidemiology and natural history.  A steady increase in incidence of pancreatic cysts has been documented and is related to widespread use of new imaging technologies, mainly CT and MRI. Incidental pancreatic cyst diagnosis ranges from 2.6% to 20% depending on imaging modality and population. The dilemma is that cysts with malignant potential account for ~50% of all cysts and have a d50% 5-year survival as invasive cancers. Yet, it is often unclear which cysts will progress partly due to the poorly understood epidemiology and natural history of these lesions. Further, regardless of malignant potential, current guidelines recommend either ""watch and wait"" or surgical resection with decisions based on cyst size, location, symptoms and patient eligibility for surgery. Cancer prevention is the goal of surgery but the significant morbidity and mortality associated with surgical resection cannot be ignored. Thus, continued research that contributes to finer sub-classification and diagnosis of cysts that are or will progress to cancer s needed to prevent unnecessary surgery, characterize high risk populations, improve prognosis and increase knowledge of the understudied natural history of these lesions. A secondary benefit is the potential that this work also will shed light on pancreatogenesis. Our aims are to: 1) Determine cyst lesion incidence in patients e40 years old who received an abdominal CT or MRI at UCSF from 1996-2015; 2) For cyst patients followed at UCSF, abstract prospective clinical and outcome data from medical, pathology and laboratory records to determine factors related to cyst progression/ malignancy and identify archival biospecimens for banking. Link pancreatic cyst patients with SEER cancer registry data to determine cancer outcomes and; 3) Frequency- match controls (no cyst) to cyst cases by 5-year age group, sex, reason for imaging and imaging modality to determine demographic and clinical factors related to pancreatic cyst risk. We expect to identify about 2,000 incident pancreatic cyst patients from review of ~50,000 studies. Descriptive statistics, adjusted multivariable Cox regression including with time-dependent covariates, and unconditional logistic regression analyses will be used to address the study aims. Achievement of our overarching goal, to develop a richly annotated database registry of abdominal imaging-identified (incidental and non-incidental) pancreatic cyst patients at UCSF, will enable further research of understudied factors related to risk and progression of pancreatic cysts and by type. More importantly, as public registries of pancreatic cysts do not exist, our project is well-positioned to build the infrastructure and resources for support of futue prospective cohorts to identify factors to 1) understand biological mechanisms contributing to cyst development; 2) predict progression and malignancy and; 3) better define at-risk groups for closer monitoring or intervention. A comprehensive understanding of pancreatic cyst epidemiology and natural history is of utmost importance to provide the best options for patient care and has the potential to add new data about early pancreatogenesis to inform screening and therapeutic targets.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diagnosis of pancreatic cysts has increased dramatically with the aging of the population and the widespread use of CT and MRI scans for clinical evaluation of a variety of conditions. At least 50% of these cysts have malignant potential, yet we cannot accurately predict which cysts harbor cancer or will progress to cancer because we have a limited understanding of factors that increase risk and explain pancreatic cyst development. Research to expand knowledge that clarifies how pancreatic cysts develop and who is at risk for malignant cystic lesions, will improve patient treatment and reduce the number of patients who undergo unnecessary surgical resection that carries risk of morbidity and mortality.            ",Pancreatic cystic lesions: descriptive epidemiology and natural history,8705948,R03CA179681,"['Abdomen', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'CA-19-9 Antigen', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Cyst', 'Cystic Lesion', 'Cystic Neoplasm', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Descriptive Epidemiology', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Excision', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Inherited', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Medical', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucinous', 'Mucinous Neoplasm', 'Natural History', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Ovarian Cysts', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Cyst', 'Pancreatitis', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Tubular formation', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abstracting', 'age group', 'aged', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer prevention', 'cohort', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'new growth', 'novel', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sex', 'standard care', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'trait']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2014,78875,-0.031240562454356535
"Predictors of Negative Outcomes Following Acute Care Encounters in Older Medicare DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergency department (ED) is an inherently high-risk setting, especially for older adults. EDs employ a rapid triage and evaluation system that may not capture the complex nature of a geriatric visit. The disposition plan of patients who visit an ED is to be directly discharged home, placed in observation care, or admitted to the hospital. There is mounting concern that recent increased use of observation care may also subject patients to a rapid diagnostic regiment with unknown utility. As older patients continue to  rely on the ED and hospitals for their care, the potential for treatment that is not geriatric-oriented and results in undesirable outcomes shortly after discharge is high. A negative outcome within 7-days of discharge from an acute care encounter is temporally related to the visit and has important policy implications. The goal of this research program is to identify patients at risk for a short-term negative outcome, defined as either an inpatient admission or death, within 7 days of discharge from their acute care encounter. The proposal will utilize a randomly selected sample of 5% Medicare Claims data, which amounts to 2.4 million beneficiaries, of which patients age > 65 years who visit the ED in 2012 will be analyzed. The multi-disciplinary project team includes experts in health services research, geriatrics, emergency medicine, administrative claims data research, and statistics. In Aim 1, the study will assess predictors of ED disposition (discharge or observation care) following the ED visit. The team will then conduct a stratified analysis to identify predictors of negative outcomes following discharge from observation care (Aim 2) or the ED (Aim 3). The proposal will assess the association between two sets of primary predictors, ED discharge diagnosis codes developed by the PI as well as the recently created Medicare Chronic Conditions, and outcomes. Additional variables will include patient demographics, comorbidities, facility characteristics, prior inpatient utilization, skilled nursing facility usage, and community demographics. The analysis will include descriptive statistics, assessment for similarities and collinearity between the predictors, and hierarchical random effects logistic regression models pertaining to each Aim. All project aims have sufficient power to complete the analyses. The proposed study will identify characteristics of patients at risk for negative short-term outcomes following acute care encounters and will (1) provide population-level national data to understand negative outcomes following discharge, (2) serve as a foundation for future work in developing a post-discharge intervention that will reduce these events, and (3) help ED managers, geriatricians, and health policy experts develop national guidelines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The emergency department (ED) is an inherently high-risk setting, especially for older adults. EDs and more recently, observation services, employ a rapid triage and evaluation system that may not capture the complex nature of a geriatric visit and could result in either admission or death within 7 days of discharge. Understanding the characteristics of patients at risk for such outcomes after discharge from the ED or observation care can help improve both ED and follow-up care. Currently, this information is not known. Our study will use national Medicare claims files to identify the patients at risk for these outcomes with the goal of helping improve care for all older adults.",Predictors of Negative Outcomes Following Acute Care Encounters in Older Medicare,8749230,R03AG047862,"['18 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Comorbidity Index', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'System', 'Triage', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cost', 'demographics', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'male', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'policy implication', 'population based', 'programs', 'statistics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2014,94500,0.024218817305954345
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.            ",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8617518,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2014,129546,0.010776666566664227
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes.  Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.            ",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8699494,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2014,137160,-0.005332178621049587
"NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although cervical cancer is preventable, it still continues to be a leading cause of death. Following the evidence- based guidelines for cervical cancer prevention is challenging for healthcare providers, due to which many patients do not receive the optimal preventive care. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems can potentially improve the care delivery. However, the current CDS systems only identify patients overdue for screening, and do not suggest the optimal screening interval. Moreover they do not help with surveillance of patients with abnormal screening results. This is because the existing systems lack the capability to process free- text clinical reports that contain information needed for applying the guidelines. Hence there is a critical need for natural language processing (NLP)-enabled CDS systems that can utilize discrete as well as free-text patient information for enhancing the decision support. Our long-term goal is to improve healthcare delivery of cervical cancer prevention with guideline based reminders. The central hypothesis is that NLP- enabled CDS system will significantly improve the quality of care delivery for cervical cancer prevention. The rationale is that use of NLP will improve granularity of the guideline implementation, which will in-turn enhance care delivery. As preliminary work we have developed an NLP-enabled CDS system that automatically interprets the patient information from the electronic health record and applies the national guidelines to compute the optimal recommendation for screening and surveillance. We have performed validation of the system in a non-clinical setting.1 In this application we will proceed towards deployment of the system in the clinical setting, and will carry out studies for measuring the impact on the quality of care delivery. In ai one, we will validate the system in the clinical setting and will optimize its usability and workflw integration. In aim two, we will test the hypothesis that reminders from the NLP-enabled CDS system to primary care providers will improve the quality of care delivery, by performing a one year intervention control study across four sites of a primary care practice. In aim three, we will test the hypothesis that reminders to non-adherent high-risk patients will improve their surveillance rates, by performing a randomized intervention study for three months. In this study, care coordinators will utilize the CDS system for sending reminders to patients that are non-adherent and at high risk due to abnormal screenings. The main contribution of this project will be knowledge about the effectiveness of NLP in enhancing the impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This project is innovative because the CDS system will utilize NLP to generate screening reminders for normal patients and surveillance reminders for patients with abnormal findings. This is a major advancement over existing systems that can only identify patients for screening.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield knowledge about the effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) to enhance impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general.

"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8723038,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2014,156324,-0.019878059715930322
"Creation of a Risk-scoring Algorithm for Early Mortality Among Elderly ESRD Patie     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Creation of a Risk-scoring Algorithm for Early Mortality Among Elderly ESRD Patients Background. The rate of early deaths, those occurring within the three months following the diagnosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), are disproportionately high among patients who are 65 and older. Inexorable increases in the incidence of patients with both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ESRD impel efforts to slow and reverse this urgent public health problem. This study aims to develop a risk-scoring system to aid in the clinical prediction of early death among elderly (>65 years) ESRD patients. Objective. We hypothesize that patients with high rates of ""early mortality"" soon after dialysis initiation have significant pre-dialysis medical conditions combined with inadequate renal disease management that does not prepare them appropriately for long- term dialysis. Our exploratory research project will identify factors associated with mortality within the first three months after starting permanent dialysis. We propose to examine the following associated with early mortality: 1) comorbid conditions found within one year prior to dialysis (e.g., cardiovascular events, acute renal failure, sepsis, hypertensive emergencies); 2) medical management prior to dialysis including involvement of a nephrology specialist, management of anemia, nutritional status, and vascular access preparation for dialysis that differentiates the 'emergent versus elective' (i.e., acute onset 'crash and burn' versus planned) transition to ESRD; and 3) use of health services in the latter stages of CKD. Results from these analyses will be used to develop a prognostic model and scoring algorithm for early mortality among dialysis patients. Methods. Using historical Medicare claims data, we propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study to develop a user friendly prognostic index. To identify the study population, we will construct a complete renal failure patient history by linking the pre-dialysis and post dialysis data to assess the predictors of early death. The proposed study is unique in linking the 2000-2009 ESRD data files to the 5% Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) sample that has recently become available for research purposes. The total number of Medicare-eligible CKD patients from this period is approximately 831,000; of these, roughly 10% become ESRD-eligible and form the basis of our study population. Multivariate logistic regression models will b used to test each hypothesis and identify the significant risk factors for early mortality. Significance. We plan to identify potentially ""modifiable"" factors that are associated with early death among a population that transitions from CKD to ESRD requiring expensive, permanent and life-altering dialysis therapy. Given the high mortality rates during the first year after dialsis, accurate prediction of those destined for early death would be useful to patients and their families, providers, and society in making decisions about treatment.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Creation of a Risk-scoring Algorithm for Early Mortality Among Elderly ESRD Patients The morbidity and mortality rates among chronic kidney disease patients transitioning to end- stage renal disease (ESRD) are 'unacceptably high' according to the NIDDK (1). Healthy People 2010 concludes that ""medically appropriate care of these patients within 12 months before the start of renal replacement therapy reduces the substantial illness, disability, and death associated with treated chronic kidney failure (2)."" The National Kidney Foundation's clinical guidelines, Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI), call for development of a predictive clinical tool - using kidney disease diagnoses, risk factors, and/or other variables - to better predict risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (3). Using existing Medicare databases - linking the pre-dialysis patients to their subsequent transition into the ESRD program - we will develop a prognostic scoring index that will assist nephrologists and elderly patients and their families in identifying those patients at risk for early mortality ater initiating dialysis.

"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8730137,K23DK090304,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K23,2014,172287,0.0030053587309862005
"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization. Given the rapidly rising numbers of patients with dementia, reducing potentially preventable hospitalization could have an enormous impact on public health.            ",Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms,8769634,K08AG048321,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kale - dietary', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleeplessness', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'behavior change', 'career', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'geriatric mental health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'neuropsychiatry', 'patient population', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2014,175103,0.0023460273896311794
"Psychiatric Epidemiology: Racial Disparities among Vulnerable Populations with De DESCRIPTION (Abstract Provided by Applicant): Remarkably little is known about protective factors that reduce African Americans' risk for depression and diabetes comorbidity. In particular, the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans has never been demonstrated with a nationally representative sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences. The lack of research on depression and diabetes comorbidity research among African Americans is due primarily to rather small samples of Black Americans in available data sets from which to draw meaningful conclusions. The proposed research plan aims to provide a comprehensive examination of whether socioeconomic status (SES) and known risk and protective factors are correlated with reductions in the risk for comorbid depression and diabetes with special attention to low income populations in a nationally representative sample of 5,191 African Americans and Caribbean Blacks. The public health significance lies in specifying which demographic factors related to lower comorbidity risk, which will inform subsequent health social service prevention interventions and strategies. The present study plan is designed to advance knowledge and make five important contributions to the literature on depression and diabetes comorbidity among African Americans, namely by: (1) capitalizing on the strengths of a large, nationally representative data set, the National Survey of American Life [NSAL]; (2) determining whether SES is associated with reductions in the risk for the studied comorbid condition by Blacks; (3) examining the mediation effects of health insurance status on the relationship between SES and comorbid depression and diabetes conditions; (4) investigating the relative effects of comorbid status on employment outcomes for welfare recipients; and (5) describing the cultural meaning of being diagnosed with and managing health care with a comorbid diagnosis. The data analytic approaches to be used include logistic regression, multi-nominal logistic regression, and qualitative theme analyses techniques.   Comorbid depression and diabetes is recognized as a condition that is costly to the health care system and is a vital topic of public health concern. Remarkably, few investigations focus on the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans with this comorbid condition. Moreover, no studies have demonstrated variable linkages with a nationally representative African American sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences until this one. The Surgeon General's report (2001), ""Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity - A supplement to mental health,"" highlighted understanding the protective and risk factors for comorbid conditions among Blacks, as an emergent public health research priority",Psychiatric Epidemiology: Racial Disparities among Vulnerable Populations with De,8687991,K22MD003934,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'African Caribbean', 'Age', 'American', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Career Transition Award', 'Client', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Cultural Diversity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Employment', 'Employment Status', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Income', 'Inequality', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Mediation', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Plant Roots', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Provider', 'Public Assistance', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Social Health Services', 'Social Welfare', 'Social Work', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uninsured', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'information gathering', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'programs', 'public health research', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'trend']",NIMHD,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT ALBANY,K22,2014,192912,-0.010963008212408592
"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.                  Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Accelerating the pace at which patients are recruited into clinical trials has the potential for improving the speed at which new treatments are made available to the public.",An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records,8722624,R01LM011116,"['Address', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'falls', 'health record', 'improved', 'screening']",NLM,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,300537,0.003646506878348264
"Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contradiction of early cancer detection is that while some benefit others receive a detrimental diagnosis. A definitive example is mammography and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS, which most frequently presents as a non-palpable lesion, was rarely detected before the advent of modern mammography. Since 1983 there has been a 290% increase in DCIS incidence in women under 50 and 500% in those over 50. Given that only 5-10% of DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer with a 10-year mortality rate of 1-2%, DCIS experts suggest breast conservation for the majority of patients. However, these women continue to be overtreated with mastectomy and radiation, at rates comparable to those with invasive cancer. The inability to discern those at low vs. high risk is due in part to non-reproducible study results as well as inadequate statistical methods for risk prediction and validation.  We have collected a population-based DCIS cohort with the goal of delineating those women least likely to recur with invasive cancer and, hence, appropriate candidates for less aggressive treatments. Recently we established risk indices and published the corresponding absolute risk estimates for type of recurrence. However, two features of the study design, namely the presence of competing risks and the use of a stratified case-cohort design, constrained us to using crude empirical methods for analysis and left us unable to validate the clinical utility of our models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a unified, principled statistical framework for building, selecting, and evaluating clinically relevant risk indices, permitting refinement and validation of existing risk prediction models in our DCIS study as well as beyond.  We face multiple challenges including how to objectively build risk indices with relevant variables; how to estimate the corresponding risks (competing or not) in various subsample study designs; and, how to validate the resulting risk prediction models. Recently, we developed partDSA, a tree-based method which affords tremendous flexibility in building predictive models and provides an ideal foundation for developing a clinician- friendly tool for accurate stratification and risk prediction. In its curret form, partDSA is unable to estimate absolute risk in the presence of competing risks accounting for subsample study designs. Here we extend partDSA for such clinically relevant scenarios (Aim 1). We also propose aggregate learning for risk prediction to increase prediction accuracy and subsequently to build more stable but easily interpretable risk models (Aim 2). Finally, we propose the necessary methods for validating the resulting models (Aim 3).  Our proposal has two immediate public health benefits: first, these novel statistical methods will result in a clinician-friendly, publicly available tool for accurate risk prediction, stratification and validaion in numerous clinical settings; second, current DCIS risk models will be refined and validated with the expectation of better delineating those at low risk, hence strong candidates for conservative treatments including active surveillance.          Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.

"A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. RESEARCH & RELATED Other Project Information 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Of the approximately 10 million people in the US living with paralysis, 15,000 are the result of spinal cord injury each year. The first year of care can range from $322,000-$986,000, with lifetime costs of $1.4-4M for someone injured at 25 years of age. In addition to potentially devastating sensorimotor disturbances, there is a huge financial cost, estimated to be $13.55B in medical care, therapy, and lost productivity nationwide. Until very recently, the recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) was bleak, with little hope of restoring motor function. To address this we have demonstrated that the physiological state of the spinal circuitry of rats and cats can be modulated with epidural stimulation to generate voluntary limb motor function over a range of speeds, loads, and directions, a finding we have extended to humans. Three years post-injury, a motor complete spinal cord injured human subject was implanted with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord. In less than one month after implantation, the subject could stand independently, and after 7 months of daily epidural stimulation and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of epidural stimulation, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of epidural stimulation. We will advance these discoveries with the use of non-invasive stimulation of the lumbosacral cord to improve lower limb function following SCI. Central to this proposal is our discovery of a painless electrical multi-channel (stimulation of multiple parts of the spinal cord) theranostic tool that can be applied to the surface of the skin, termed transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation (TESCS), bypassing the need for a surgically-implanted electrode array. In the first phase of this proposal we will demonstrate proof-of-principle that stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord can assess spared spinal motor function by: 1) Testing responses to transcutaneous electrical stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury; and 2) defining the operational parameters of electrical stimulation that that are most effective using a machine-learning protocol, and 3) produce a multi-channel commercial prototype. This commercial product will undergo testing similar to the proof-of- principle device. This device will then be tested in subjects with cervicothoracic spinal cord injury and evaluated with a machine-learning protocol. This Phase I proposal will deliver a device that can painlessly and non-invasively aid in the assessment and recovery of SCI by delivering a specific electrical stimulation paradigm to the lumbosacral cord that improves use of the lower limbs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. PROJECT NARRATIVE It now seems possible to apply three interventions: transcutaneous stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training, to assess and enable the excitability of spared neural circuits in humans with a thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their legs. This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postura and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI in which epidural stimulation was used. We will build and demonstrate a multi-channel transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation theranostic tool that we propose will allow assessment and enabling of lower limb function following a cervicothoracic spinal cord injury.

"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.            ",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,8721037,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'human Huntingtin protein', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2014,359539,-0.023771173722246432
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8717634,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2014,371508,-0.017666398268290882
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,8821956,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2014,449993,0.021406191647948748
"Predicting Hip Fracture Using a Biomechanical Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hip fractures are a significant cause of disability and mortality in older persons. The most common tool for diagnosis of osteoporosis and prediction of fracture risk is bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual- energy X-ray absorptiometry. Yet, up to half of individuals suffering a hip fracture do not have osteoporosis by BMD testing; thus alternative approaches to fracture risk assessment are needed. This underscores the importance of looking for additional contributors to fracture risk, such as reduced soft tissue thickness at the trochanter, which attenuates the fall forces that may lead to fracture. According to biomechanical principles, when the ratio of applied force to bone strength, (termed the 'Factor-of-Risk'), exceeds one, a fracture will occur. Two previous studies have examined the Factor-of-Risk along with trochanteric soft tissue thickness but had only small numbers of hip fractures, and conflicting results. To better understand the factors associated with hip fracture, we propose to use a biomechanical approach to assess hip fracture risk that includes both estimated forces applied to the hip during a sideways fall as well as the strength of the proximal femur. The specific goal is to investigate the contribution of trochanteric soft tissue thickness t hip fracture risk, and to include this in the biomechanical Factor-of-Risk model. We hypothesize these factors predict hip fracture, and further that the factor-of-risk prediction of hip fracture isk will prove better than BMD assessment alone and better than the World Health Organization FRAX tool. We will identify prospectively ascertained hip fracture cases from three cohorts (Framingham Study, MrOS, Rancho Bernardo Study) and from each cohort also select up to four sex- and age-matched (within 3-years) non-fracture cohort members as controls, using the case-cohort study design to increase efficiency. Soft tissue thickness in 2,435 individuals will be assess on whole body DXA scans obtained at the earliest time in each cohort before any subsequent hip fracture occurred. Relative risks will be assessed as odds ratios using conditional logistic regression. This study has potential to significantly alter the way hip fractue risk is currently being assessed, and thus how patients are selected for drug therapy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The most common tool to diagnose osteoporosis/predict hip fracture risk is bone density testing, and yet, up to half of adults suffering a hip fracture do no have osteoporosis by this test; thus alternative approaches to fracture risk assessment are needed. We will investigate the role of trochanteric soft tissue thickness to hip fracture risk, an include this in the biomechanical Factor-of-Risk model, to examine if they will predict hip fracture and further do so better than currently available prediction tools, providing new public health insights            ",Predicting Hip Fracture Using a Biomechanical Approach,8628044,R01AR060816,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Femur', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Height', 'Hip Fractures', 'Hip region structure', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menopause', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Smoking Status', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trochanters', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'absorption', 'base', 'bone strength', 'cohort', 'diagnosis standard', 'disability', 'falls', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'men', 'mortality', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'tool']",NIAMS,HEBREW REHABILITATION CENTER FOR AGED,R01,2014,477496,-0.014621655097073437
"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.                ",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,8698820,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'monitoring device', 'new technology', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,506032,0.004605882915236896
"Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) prevalence has increased and will continue so over the next 30 years with a profound individual and societal burden. Early detection of HF may be useful in mitigating this burden. The purpose of this proposal is to develop robust predictive models that make use of longitudinal electronic health record (EHR). Our long term goal is to use such models to detect HF at an earlier stage (e.g., AHA/ACA Stages A or B) than usually occurs in primary care. We have completed extensive preliminary work using 10 years of longitudinal EHR data on primary care patients. Using text mining and machine learning tools we have found that Framingham criteria are documented in the EHR long before more specific diagnostic studies are done. These symptoms are considerably more common among incident HF cases than controls two to four years before diagnosis. Moreover, clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and other data routinely captured in the EHR predicts future HF diagnosis. We propose to extend this work on early detection of HF with the following aims: 1) To develop more sensitive and specific criteria for use of Framingham HF signs and symptoms in the early detection of HF. We have shown that positive and negative affirmation of Framingham signs and symptoms are useful in HF detection 1-4 years before diagnosis. We propose to address the following: a) Which Framingham signs and symptoms and combinations thereof are most useful for early detection? b) Are there temporal sequences and correlations among signs and symptoms that improve accuracy of detection? c) How do the criteria vary by HF subtype? We hypothesize that analysis of routinely documented signs and symptoms data will yield a clinically meaningful improvement in the accuracy of detecting HF 1 to 2 years before actual diagnosis; 2) To determine the differential improvement in accuracy of predicting diagnosis of HF by combining common fixed field EHR data with text data to improve early detection of HF. Our preliminary work indicates that longitudinal EHR data (e.g., clinical, laboratory, health behaviors, diagnoses, use of care, etc) are useful in predicting future HF diagnosis. Based on these findings, we recognize an increasingly sophisticated analysis will be required to identify how to use these data to optimize predictive power. We hypothesize that the specific models and the performance of these models will vary by HF subtypes of HF; 3) To determine how digital ECG related measures can be used alone and in combination with other data to improve early detection of HF. Real time access to digital ECG data affords unique opportunities to extract a diversity of measures that may be useful in primary care in the early detection of HF; and 4) To develop preliminary operational protocols for early detection of HF in primary care. We will need to consider how the output from the model can be used to support clinical guidance and shared decision-making. Moreover, models need to be developed for data rich and data poor settings. The long term goal of the proposed work is relevant to the national priority for adoption of EHRs in clinical practice and for meaningful use of such technology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart Failure (HF) strikes one in 5 US citizens over age 40, has a profound impact on health, and is almost always detected too late to allow doctors to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. We propose to use sophisticated analytic tools to search through electronic health records of patients for early signals of HF. The long term goal of our work is to use such tools to detect HF early enough to allow doctors to change the course of disease and substantially reduce HF morbidity and the risk of death.                ",Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care,8652345,R01HL116832,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee Strikes', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'body system', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'shared decision making', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trend']",NHLBI,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R01,2014,527741,0.01426818366234703
"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.

"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.  Narrative:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.",Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms,8586273,R01HL106545,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcified', 'Calcium', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'computer aided detection', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,610289,-0.04457623315812186
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.            ",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,8695570,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,616625,-0.02075642115147882
"Technology Application to Enhance Discharge Referral Decision Support     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decreasing readmissions through better discharge planning (DP) and transitional care is a national healthcare priority. RightCare Solutions has leveraged over 10 years of interdisciplinary academic research led by a nurse researcher, and through our highly successful phase one SBIR grant demonstrated market value for the D2S2 product and the technical expertise of our team. The D2S2 is a six-item decision support tool installed by RightCare Solutions in the hospital EHR to assist discharge planners to identify high-risk patients upon admission allowing time and focus to target appropriate transitional and post-acute care to prevent readmissions. We have achieved outstanding outcomes from our phase 1 award and are proposing further technological developments to enhance our commercial launch. The market potential for the D2S2 tool is significant since discharge decision support is estimated to be applicable to roughly 6,500 U.S. hospitals with a census that is 60% older adults equaling 14 million discharges per year. The phase 1 results indicate a significant impact on 30 and 60 day readmissions giving us strong evidence as to the value of the product. However, the results and our experience using the software indicate there is opportunity to enhance the product's accruacy and functionality. We propose to enhance our predictive accuracy through innovative data mining and machine learning techniques and to improve the functionality by electronically connecting the acute and post-acute care settings. Due to implementation in the three hospitals of the University of Pennsylvania Health System we have data on over 6,000 patients and through the continued live implementation we will accumulate data on over 25,000 patients by the start of the phase 2 grant. Using existing, and new data generated from continued operations, this proposed SBIR grant will advance the product in two major ways to enhance the commercial benefit to its users. Aim 1: Develop, test, and scale SMART capabilities, a dynamic process for improving prediction accuracy, by using hospital-specific and patient level characteristics (D2S2 variables and additional clinical and non-clinical characteristics) and modern data mining/machine learning techniques. AIM 2: Operationalize the D2S2 recommendations by electronically connecting high-risk patients with post-acute care (PAC) providers and stakeholders, known as CONNECT capabilities. Called a ""learning health system"" the end- product of this SBIR grant will provide continuous evaluation and improvement to the end-user measured against their goals.

"Early Acute Lung Injury: Prospective Evaluation Prior to Respiratory Failure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary and non-pulmonary insults and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite two decades of targeted investigation by the NHLBI, little is known about ALI prior to progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Accordingly, the aims of this research plan are to: 1) prospectively identify independent predictors of progression to ALI requiring mechanical ventilation and establish a clinical definition of early ALI; 2) evaluate the pathogenetic role of biologic markers of inflammation and lung injury and their value for refining risk stratification of patients at risk for progression to ALI, and 3) test the potential therapeutic value of an aerosolized beta-2 agonist in patients with early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 1 will identify cases of potential early ALI by screening chest radiographs of all adult emergency department and medicine service admissions. Patients admitted to the hospital with bilateral opacities on chest radiograph not due to isolated left atrial hypertension will be followed for progression to ALI during their hospitalization. Clinical characteristics (demographics, diagnoses, comorbidities, vital signs, and Borg dyspnea scores) will be recorded for the first 72 hours of admission. Independent predictors of progression to ALI will be determined by multivariate logistic regression and incorporated into a clinical definition of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 2, plasma levels of biomarkers (IL-8, sTNFr-1, vWF, ICAM-1, SP-D and RAGE) representing distinct pathways contributing to acute lung injury will be measured at time 0 and 24 hours after study enrollment. Biomarkers will be analyzed by multivariate regression analysis to assess their value for stratifying patients at risk for progression to ALI and provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 3 I will conduct a randomized clinical trial of aerosoUzed albuterol vs. placebo in patients with early ALI. The primary endpoint will be the Pa02 / Fi02 on day 4 of treatment. Secondary outcome measures will be rate of progression to ALI and change in plasma biologic marker levels. This will be a first-of-its-kind trial to establish that patients with early ALI can be identified and treatment can be initiated prior to need for mechanical ventilation. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Following the paradigm of early goal-directed therapy for severe sepsis, clinical benefit may derive from identifying patients with early ALI and initiating treatment prior to the need for mechanical ventilation (and therefore prior to meeting current study entry criteria). Establishing evidence based clinical definition of early ALI will facilitate identification and risk stratification of subjects for enrollment in future clinical trials.

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes.  Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.            ",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8528464,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2013,137160,-0.005332178621049587
"CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SUMMARY This project aims to produce and beta-test a clinical decision support application for end- stage heart failure, titled CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System. It will be designed for patients with progressive heart failure who may eventually become candidates for ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy. The software will be build upon existing machine learning and data mining technology, developed by the PI and colleagues, designed to predict 90-day mortality following VAD implantation. This Phase- 1 effort will entail development of graphic user interfaces for both patients and clinicians to incorporate personalized prognostic information into a functional decision-support utility. The inference algorithm will also be expanded to encompass adverse events, and risk of readmission. In this Phase-1 feasibility project, CHRiSS will be programmed and beta-tested at West Penn Allegheny Health System (WPAHS). This will entail semi- structured interviews to collect relevant expert knowledge, and mining the electronic medical records (EMR) to calibrate the prognostic algorithm to the institution-specific data. Successful completion of this Phase I project will lead to a multi-center trial in which the software is fully validated. Ultimate succes of this project will result in a software application that will optimize the benefit of VAD therapy to public health, while reducing cost by reducing the unacceptably high rate of adverse events and unnecessary readmissions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Heart-assist devices are becoming more commonly used to treat people with severe cardiac failure - who otherwise have few options to return to a normal life. It is estimated that tens of thousands of Americans could benefit from this therapy annually; however, only a few thousand are performed per year. This project aims to develop a software application to better inform patients and doctors about the risks and benefits of this therapy. It will assist patients and doctors to work together when weighing options - with respect to both survival and quality of life. The long-term benefits would be to improve the efficiency of delivering this therapy, thereby reducing the cost, and expanding its distribution to the many people that need it.            ",CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System,8592756,R41HL120428,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Businesses', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Foundations', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Heart-Assist Devices', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Period', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'implantation', 'improved', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'satisfaction', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability', 'ventricular assist device']",NHLBI,BLENDERHOUSE,R41,2013,150000,0.004442029595056152
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8593988,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2013,156324,-0.019878059715930322
"Creation of a Risk-scoring Algorithm for Early Mortality Among Elderly ESRD Patie     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Creation of a Risk-scoring Algorithm for Early Mortality Among Elderly ESRD Patients Background. The rate of early deaths, those occurring within the three months following the diagnosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), are disproportionately high among patients who are 65 and older. Inexorable increases in the incidence of patients with both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ESRD impel efforts to slow and reverse this urgent public health problem. This study aims to develop a risk-scoring system to aid in the clinical prediction of early death among elderly (>65 years) ESRD patients. Objective. We hypothesize that patients with high rates of ""early mortality"" soon after dialysis initiation have significant pre-dialysis medical conditions combined with inadequate renal disease management that does not prepare them appropriately for long- term dialysis. Our exploratory research project will identify factors associated with mortality within the first three months after starting permanent dialysis. We propose to examine the following associated with early mortality: 1) comorbid conditions found within one year prior to dialysis (e.g., cardiovascular events, acute renal failure, sepsis, hypertensive emergencies); 2) medical management prior to dialysis including involvement of a nephrology specialist, management of anemia, nutritional status, and vascular access preparation for dialysis that differentiates the 'emergent versus elective' (i.e., acute onset 'crash and burn' versus planned) transition to ESRD; and 3) use of health services in the latter stages of CKD. Results from these analyses will be used to develop a prognostic model and scoring algorithm for early mortality among dialysis patients. Methods. Using historical Medicare claims data, we propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study to develop a user friendly prognostic index. To identify the study population, we will construct a complete renal failure patient history by linking the pre-dialysis and post dialysis data to assess the predictors of early death. The proposed study is unique in linking the 2000-2009 ESRD data files to the 5% Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) sample that has recently become available for research purposes. The total number of Medicare-eligible CKD patients from this period is approximately 831,000; of these, roughly 10% become ESRD-eligible and form the basis of our study population. Multivariate logistic regression models will b used to test each hypothesis and identify the significant risk factors for early mortality. Significance. We plan to identify potentially ""modifiable"" factors that are associated with early death among a population that transitions from CKD to ESRD requiring expensive, permanent and life-altering dialysis therapy. Given the high mortality rates during the first year after dialsis, accurate prediction of those destined for early death would be useful to patients and their families, providers, and society in making decisions about treatment.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Creation of a Risk-scoring Algorithm for Early Mortality Among Elderly ESRD Patients The morbidity and mortality rates among chronic kidney disease patients transitioning to end- stage renal disease (ESRD) are 'unacceptably high' according to the NIDDK (1). Healthy People 2010 concludes that ""medically appropriate care of these patients within 12 months before the start of renal replacement therapy reduces the substantial illness, disability, and death associated with treated chronic kidney failure (2)."" The National Kidney Foundation's clinical guidelines, Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI), call for development of a predictive clinical tool - using kidney disease diagnoses, risk factors, and/or other variables - to better predict risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (3). Using existing Medicare databases - linking the pre-dialysis patients to their subsequent transition into the ESRD program - we will develop a prognostic scoring index that will assist nephrologists and elderly patients and their families in identifying those patients at risk for early mortality ater initiating dialysis.

"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder.

"Psychiatric Epidemiology: Racial Disparities among Vulnerable Populations with De DESCRIPTION (Abstract Provided by Applicant): Remarkably little is known about protective factors that reduce African Americans' risk for depression and diabetes comorbidity. In particular, the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans has never been demonstrated with a nationally representative sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences. The lack of research on depression and diabetes comorbidity research among African Americans is due primarily to rather small samples of Black Americans in available data sets from which to draw meaningful conclusions. The proposed research plan aims to provide a comprehensive examination of whether socioeconomic status (SES) and known risk and protective factors are correlated with reductions in the risk for comorbid depression and diabetes with special attention to low income populations in a nationally representative sample of 5,191 African Americans and Caribbean Blacks. The public health significance lies in specifying which demographic factors related to lower comorbidity risk, which will inform subsequent health social service prevention interventions and strategies. The present study plan is designed to advance knowledge and make five important contributions to the literature on depression and diabetes comorbidity among African Americans, namely by: (1) capitalizing on the strengths of a large, nationally representative data set, the National Survey of American Life [NSAL]; (2) determining whether SES is associated with reductions in the risk for the studied comorbid condition by Blacks; (3) examining the mediation effects of health insurance status on the relationship between SES and comorbid depression and diabetes conditions; (4) investigating the relative effects of comorbid status on employment outcomes for welfare recipients; and (5) describing the cultural meaning of being diagnosed with and managing health care with a comorbid diagnosis. The data analytic approaches to be used include logistic regression, multi-nominal logistic regression, and qualitative theme analyses techniques.  Project Narrative Comorbid depression and diabetes is recognized as a condition that is costly to the health care system and is a vital topic of public health concern. Remarkably, few investigations focus on the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans with this comorbid condition. Moreover, no studies have demonstrated variable linkages with a nationally representative African American sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences until this one. The Surgeon General's report (2001), ""Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity - A supplement to mental health,"" highlighted understanding the protective and risk factors for comorbid conditions among Blacks, as an emergent public health research priority",Psychiatric Epidemiology: Racial Disparities among Vulnerable Populations with De,8521365,K22MD003934,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'African Caribbean', 'Age', 'American', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Career Transition Award', 'Client', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Cultural Diversity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Employment', 'Employment Status', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Income', 'Inequality', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Mediation', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Plant Roots', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Provider', 'Public Assistance', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Social Health Services', 'Social Welfare', 'Social Work', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uninsured', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'information gathering', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'programs', 'public health research', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'trend']",NIMHD,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT ALBANY,K22,2013,180373,-0.010835131023721075
"Natural Course of Cannabis Use Disorders from Childhood Through Early Adulthood    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In many countries cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug. In the United States, adolescence and early adulthood are particularly critical periods for the initiation of cannabis use and the development of cannabis use disorders (CUDs). A recent survey of high school youth, for example, indicated that more than 2 out of 5 12th grade students have used cannabis. Similarly, based on findings from a recent national survey, researchers estimated that 2.4 million U.S. residents aged 12 years or older initiated cannabis during the prior year, and that during the same 12-month period about 4.3 million residents (or 1.7% of the U.S. population) either abused or were dependent on cannabis. Despite the importance of CUDs as a public health concern, important gaps in knowledge remain concerning the development and course of CUDs in the general population. To address these gaps, the proposed research will document several important features associated with the natural course of CUDs. To accomplish these research aims, an existing data set from the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project (OADP) will be analyzed. The OADP is a community-based and multi- generational longitudinal study that spans the peak period for the emergence of sustained patterns of hazardous cannabis use, from adolescence through early adulthood.  The research described in this application will address several cannabis-related topics not previously addressed in prior OADP publications. Five broad areas are emphasized that integrate OADP's longitudinal and developmental features. (1) The prevalence of CUDs in the OADP sample will be reported, and hazards functions that describe the time to recovery from the initial CUDs episode, the probability of relapse, and the time to disorder recurrence will also be provided. (2) Subgroups of persons will be identified based on the developmental course of CUDs over the lifetime, and childhood risk factors and adult psychosocial outcomes associated with distinct trajectory subgroups will be reported. (3) The parental transmission of CUD risk will be evaluated and documented. (4) Childhood and adolescent psychiatric risk factors for later CUDs will be evaluated with proportional hazards functions and logistic regression approaches. (5) Proportional hazards modeling and logistic regression approaches will be used to evaluate the psychiatric outcomes of CUD episodes. Findings from this proposed research have the potential to inform theories of the epidemiology of CUDs, aid the development of screening tools to identify youth who are at risk for future CUDs, facilitate the development of targeted prevention programs and therapeutic interventions, and reduce the likelihood of relapse once beneficial behavior change has occurred.        The proposed research is consistent with two strategic goals of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). (1) To prevent the initiation of cannabis use and the development of cannabis use disorders (CUDs) by identifying patterns of abuse and associated psychosocial risk factors, including family factors. (2) To evaluate the potential influence of other psychiatric disorders in the development of CUDs.

"Cumulative Glycemic Burden and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Type 2 Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to provide evidence that prolonged, continuous, tight glycemic control, initiated when type 2 diabetes (DM) is first diagnosed and maintained throughout patients' DM lifetime, can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Current recommendations on care for persons with DM include tight glycated hemoglobin (A1C) control (<7%) as a means to reduce risk of CVD and other complications. Recent studies raised questions about this recommendation by failing to demonstrate that tight A1C control provides CV benefit in persons with DM, but these studies could not account for glycemic control prior to trial initiation. Other research supports the benefit of tight glycemic control over time, and suggests that even moderately elevated A1C levels in the 'normal' range indicate long-term CVD risk. To address these seemingly contradictory perspectives on how to optimize DM care, we propose to test the hypothesis that tight glycemic control does indeed reduce CVD risk, if begun early and continued throughout the course of DM. We will also assess whether cumulative glycemic burden over time, predict long-term CVD risk better than current A1C level or mean A1C over time, and to identify threshold levels of cumulative glycemic burden at which CVD risk becomes markedly elevated, among persons with DM. We will conduct the proposed analyses using data from the Kaiser Permanente Northwest Diabetes Registry. Since 1988, KPNW has developed and maintained this highly specific, sensitive, data-rich registry of members with DM; as of December 2009, it contained data on >70,000 persons. Among adults who joined the registry in 1995-2010, we will identify individuals who experienced a CVD event and match them to 5 controls who did not. We will then conduct multivariate logistic regression analyses of the extent to which A1C, mean A1C, and cumulative A1C burden predict time until first CVD event, and describe differences in the odds of CVD from date of DM diagnosis through 2010, to identify cut-points (of A1C, mean A1C over time, and cumulative glycemic burden levels) where CVD risk increases. The clinical application of such findings would lie in proving what has long been suspected - that cumulative glycemic burden is a critical CVD risk factor - thus providing critical support for the importance of initiating tight glycemic control immediately upon DM diagnosis and maintaining such control rigorously. No previous studies have evaluated cumulative glycemic burden as an indicator of CVD risk in DM, alone or in comparison to mean A1C over time, despite cumulative burden's biological plausibility as a CVD risk factor. The proposed work builds on our previous development of methods for measuring cumulative glycemic burden.        This study will use existing data on Kaiser Permanente Northwest members with diabetes from 1995- 2010 to assess whether control of high blood sugar, if begun early and continued over time, reduces cardiovascular disease risk. We will use a novel measure of high blood sugar, glycemic burden, which accounts for how high blood sugar is and how long it has been high. Our results would show the importance of treating blood sugar aggressively immediately upon diabetes diagnosis and maintaining such aggressive treatment rigorously.

"Guideline-based surveillance and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest rising cause of cancer-related deaths. Survival following diagnosis with HCC is poor unless it is detected early and stage-appropriate treatment is applied. Clinical practice guidelines outline recommendations for HCC surveillance and treatment of HCC. No study has examined the implementation or outcomes of guideline-based HCC surveillance in high risk patients or stage- appropriate treatment in patients who develop HCC. OBJECTIVES: Using data obtained from VA administrative databases combined with information abstracted from national VA electronic medical records using the VA Compensation and Pension Record Interchange application, we propose to address the following Aims: 1) to examine the implementation of guideline-based HCC surveillance in a national sample of patients with cirrhosis, and to examine patient, physician and facility factors associated with appropriate or inappropriate implementation of surveillance; 2) to evaluate the implementation of guideline-based stage-appropriate treatment among patients with HCC, and to examine patient, physician, and facility factors associated with receipt of stage-appropriate treatment; and 3) to examine the effect of guideline-based HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment on survival. METHODS: We propose a retrospective cohort study using two stratified random samples of approximately 1,500 patients with cirrhosis and 1,500 patients with HCC diagnosed during 2006-2009 in VA facilities nationwide. For Aim 1, the outcome will be appropriate (guideline-based surveillance, receipt of an imaging test unrelated to HCC surveillance, no surveillance) versus inappropriate (non-guideline based surveillance, overutilization of surveillance) implementation of HCC surveillance among patients with one of the four primary etiologies for cirrhosis (hepatitis C, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis B, alcoholic liver disease). Patient, physician, and facility factors associated with appropriate implementation of HCC surveillance will be examined using logistic regression. For Aim 2, the outcome will be receipt of stage-appropriate HCC treatment versus stage-inappropriate treatment or no treatment among patients with HCC. Each patient will be assigned to a stage-appropriate treatment category according to current guidelines, which will be compared against the treatment received. Logistic regression will be used to examine predictors of receiving stage-appropriate treatment. For Aim 3, the outcome will be survival among patients with cirrhosis who developed HCC. Receipt of appropriate HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment will be the primary predictors of interest. Marginal structural modeling will be used to examine these associations. IMPACT: This study will examine an important and timely issue in the management of HCC that has not been examined. Findings from this study will provide a strong foundation for developing and implementing a future intervention to improve the delivery of guideline-based HCC surveillance and treatment.        Outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma are poor. Practice guidelines have been developed to guide physicians in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma, from surveillance in patients at high risk to treatment in those who develop this disease. This study proposes to evaluate the implementation of guideline-based surveillance and treatment recommendations for hepatocellular carcinoma and their effect on survival, as well as consider patient, physician, and facility factors that may be associated with appropriate or inappropriate implementation of these guidelines.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.                ",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8640521,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2013,271188,-0.0096962773834221
"Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contradiction of early cancer detection is that while some benefit others receive a detrimental diagnosis. A definitive example is mammography and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS, which most frequently presents as a non-palpable lesion, was rarely detected before the advent of modern mammography. Since 1983 there has been a 290% increase in DCIS incidence in women under 50 and 500% in those over 50. Given that only 5-10% of DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer with a 10-year mortality rate of 1-2%, DCIS experts suggest breast conservation for the majority of patients. However, these women continue to be overtreated with mastectomy and radiation, at rates comparable to those with invasive cancer. The inability to discern those at low vs. high risk is due in part to non-reproducible study results as well as inadequate statistical methods for risk prediction and validation.  We have collected a population-based DCIS cohort with the goal of delineating those women least likely to recur with invasive cancer and, hence, appropriate candidates for less aggressive treatments. Recently we established risk indices and published the corresponding absolute risk estimates for type of recurrence. However, two features of the study design, namely the presence of competing risks and the use of a stratified case-cohort design, constrained us to using crude empirical methods for analysis and left us unable to validate the clinical utility of our models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a unified, principled statistical framework for building, selecting, and evaluating clinically relevant risk indices, permitting refinement and validation of existing risk prediction models in our DCIS study as well as beyond.  We face multiple challenges including how to objectively build risk indices with relevant variables; how to estimate the corresponding risks (competing or not) in various subsample study designs; and, how to validate the resulting risk prediction models. Recently, we developed partDSA, a tree-based method which affords tremendous flexibility in building predictive models and provides an ideal foundation for developing a clinician- friendly tool for accurate stratification and risk prediction. In its curret form, partDSA is unable to estimate absolute risk in the presence of competing risks accounting for subsample study designs. Here we extend partDSA for such clinically relevant scenarios (Aim 1). We also propose aggregate learning for risk prediction to increase prediction accuracy and subsequently to build more stable but easily interpretable risk models (Aim 2). Finally, we propose the necessary methods for validating the resulting models (Aim 3).  Our proposal has two immediate public health benefits: first, these novel statistical methods will result in a clinician-friendly, publicly available tool for accurate risk prediction, stratification and validaion in numerous clinical settings; second, current DCIS risk models will be refined and validated with the expectation of better delineating those at low risk, hence strong candidates for conservative treatments including active surveillance.          Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.

"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.

"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.            ",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8627692,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2013,321402,-0.017666398268290882
"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.

"A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI  A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. RESEARCH & RELATED Other Project Information 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Of the approximately 10 million people in the US living with paralysis, 15,000 are the result of spinal cord injury each year. The first year of care can range from $322,000-$986,000, with lifetime costs of $1.4-4M for someone injured at 25 years of age. In addition to potentially devastating sensorimotor disturbances, there is a huge financial cost, estimated to be $13.55B in medical care, therapy, and lost productivity nationwide. Until very recently, the recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) was bleak, with little hope of restoring motor function. To address this we have demonstrated that the physiological state of the spinal circuitry of rats and cats can be modulated with epidural stimulation to generate voluntary limb motor function over a range of speeds, loads, and directions, a finding we have extended to humans. Three years post-injury, a motor complete spinal cord injured human subject was implanted with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord. In less than one month after implantation, the subject could stand independently, and after 7 months of daily epidural stimulation and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of epidural stimulation, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of epidural stimulation. We will advance these discoveries with the use of non-invasive stimulation of the lumbosacral cord to improve lower limb function following SCI. Central to this proposal is our discovery of a painless electrical multi-channel (stimulation of multiple parts of the spinal cord) theranostic tool that can be applied to the surface of the skin, termed transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation (TESCS), bypassing the need for a surgically-implanted electrode array. In the first phase of this proposal we will demonstrate proof-of-principle that stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord can assess spared spinal motor function by: 1) Testing responses to transcutaneous electrical stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury; and 2) defining the operational parameters of electrical stimulation that that are most effective using a machine-learning protocol, and 3) produce a multi-channel commercial prototype. This commercial product will undergo testing similar to the proof-of- principle device. This device will then be tested in subjects with cervicothoracic spinal cord injury and evaluated with a machine-learning protocol. This Phase I proposal will deliver a device that can painlessly and non-invasively aid in the assessment and recovery of SCI by delivering a specific electrical stimulation paradigm to the lumbosacral cord that improves use of the lower limbs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI NeuroEnabling Technologies, Inc. PROJECT NARRATIVE It now seems possible to apply three interventions: transcutaneous stimulation, administration of pharmacological agents, and motor training, to assess and enable the excitability of spared neural circuits in humans with a thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI), thus enabling these individuals to regain use of their legs. This enabling effect is similar to that observed with improved postura and locomotor function after a mid-thoracic SCI in which epidural stimulation was used. We will build and demonstrate a multi-channel transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation theranostic tool that we propose will allow assessment and enabling of lower limb function following a cervicothoracic spinal cord injury.                ",A Theranostic Tool to Assess and Enable Spared Spinal Motor Function After SCI,8648234,R43EB018232,"['Address', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Bypass', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Felis catus', 'Financial cost', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Lumbar spinal cord structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue', 'Outpatients', 'Painless', 'Paralysed', 'Paraplegia', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Residual state', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Part', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thoracic spinal cord structure', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Training', 'Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation', 'Translating', 'Upper Extremity', 'Weight-Bearing state', 'design', 'human subject', 'human subject protection', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'injured', 'life time cost', 'meetings', 'motor control', 'motor function improvement', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'theranostics', 'tool', 'transcutaneous stimulation']",NIBIB,"NEUROENABLING TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2013,346207,-0.016468242043859414
"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.                ",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,8495026,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'monitoring device', 'new technology', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,506938,0.004605882915236896
"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.

"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.  Narrative:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.",Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms,8392109,R01HL106545,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcified', 'Calcium', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'computer aided detection', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2013,552793,-0.04457623315812186
"Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) prevalence has increased and will continue so over the next 30 years with a profound individual and societal burden. Early detection of HF may be useful in mitigating this burden. The purpose of this proposal is to develop robust predictive models that make use of longitudinal electronic health record (EHR). Our long term goal is to use such models to detect HF at an earlier stage (e.g., AHA/ACA Stages A or B) than usually occurs in primary care. We have completed extensive preliminary work using 10 years of longitudinal EHR data on primary care patients. Using text mining and machine learning tools we have found that Framingham criteria are documented in the EHR long before more specific diagnostic studies are done. These symptoms are considerably more common among incident HF cases than controls two to four years before diagnosis. Moreover, clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and other data routinely captured in the EHR predicts future HF diagnosis. We propose to extend this work on early detection of HF with the following aims: 1) To develop more sensitive and specific criteria for use of Framingham HF signs and symptoms in the early detection of HF. We have shown that positive and negative affirmation of Framingham signs and symptoms are useful in HF detection 1-4 years before diagnosis. We propose to address the following: a) Which Framingham signs and symptoms and combinations thereof are most useful for early detection? b) Are there temporal sequences and correlations among signs and symptoms that improve accuracy of detection? c) How do the criteria vary by HF subtype? We hypothesize that analysis of routinely documented signs and symptoms data will yield a clinically meaningful improvement in the accuracy of detecting HF 1 to 2 years before actual diagnosis; 2) To determine the differential improvement in accuracy of predicting diagnosis of HF by combining common fixed field EHR data with text data to improve early detection of HF. Our preliminary work indicates that longitudinal EHR data (e.g., clinical, laboratory, health behaviors, diagnoses, use of care, etc) are useful in predicting future HF diagnosis. Based on these findings, we recognize an increasingly sophisticated analysis will be required to identify how to use these data to optimize predictive power. We hypothesize that the specific models and the performance of these models will vary by HF subtypes of HF; 3) To determine how digital ECG related measures can be used alone and in combination with other data to improve early detection of HF. Real time access to digital ECG data affords unique opportunities to extract a diversity of measures that may be useful in primary care in the early detection of HF; and 4) To develop preliminary operational protocols for early detection of HF in primary care. We will need to consider how the output from the model can be used to support clinical guidance and shared decision-making. Moreover, models need to be developed for data rich and data poor settings. The long term goal of the proposed work is relevant to the national priority for adoption of EHRs in clinical practice and for meaningful use of such technology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart Failure (HF) strikes one in 5 US citizens over age 40, has a profound impact on health, and is almost always detected too late to allow doctors to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. We propose to use sophisticated analytic tools to search through electronic health records of patients for early signals of HF. The long term goal of our work is to use such tools to detect HF early enough to allow doctors to change the course of disease and substantially reduce HF morbidity and the risk of death.                ",Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care,8421618,R01HL116832,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee Strikes', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'body system', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'shared decision making', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trend']",NHLBI,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R01,2013,557031,0.01426818366234703
"Predicting Hip Fracture Using a Biomechanical Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hip fractures are a significant cause of disability and mortality in older persons. The most common tool for diagnosis of osteoporosis and prediction of fracture risk is bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual- energy X-ray absorptiometry. Yet, up to half of individuals suffering a hip fracture do not have osteoporosis by BMD testing; thus alternative approaches to fracture risk assessment are needed. This underscores the importance of looking for additional contributors to fracture risk, such as reduced soft tissue thickness at the trochanter, which attenuates the fall forces that may lead to fracture. According to biomechanical principles, when the ratio of applied force to bone strength, (termed the 'Factor-of-Risk'), exceeds one, a fracture will occur. Two previous studies have examined the Factor-of-Risk along with trochanteric soft tissue thickness but had only small numbers of hip fractures, and conflicting results. To better understand the factors associated with hip fracture, we propose to use a biomechanical approach to assess hip fracture risk that includes both estimated forces applied to the hip during a sideways fall as well as the strength of the proximal femur. The specific goal is to investigate the contribution of trochanteric soft tissue thickness t hip fracture risk, and to include this in the biomechanical Factor-of-Risk model. We hypothesize these factors predict hip fracture, and further that the factor-of-risk prediction of hip fracture isk will prove better than BMD assessment alone and better than the World Health Organization FRAX tool. We will identify prospectively ascertained hip fracture cases from three cohorts (Framingham Study, MrOS, Rancho Bernardo Study) and from each cohort also select up to four sex- and age-matched (within 3-years) non-fracture cohort members as controls, using the case-cohort study design to increase efficiency. Soft tissue thickness in 2,435 individuals will be assess on whole body DXA scans obtained at the earliest time in each cohort before any subsequent hip fracture occurred. Relative risks will be assessed as odds ratios using conditional logistic regression. This study has potential to significantly alter the way hip fractue risk is currently being assessed, and thus how patients are selected for drug therapy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The most common tool to diagnose osteoporosis/predict hip fracture risk is bone density testing, and yet, up to half of adults suffering a hip fracture do no have osteoporosis by this test; thus alternative approaches to fracture risk assessment are needed.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,8279285,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'high risk', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2012,105194,0.006245088590132478
"Early Acute Lung Injury: Prospective Evaluation Prior to Respiratory Failure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary and non-pulmonary insults and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite two decades of targeted investigation by the NHLBI, little is known about ALI prior to progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Accordingly, the aims of this research plan are to: 1) prospectively identify independent predictors of progression to ALI requiring mechanical ventilation and establish a clinical definition of early ALI; 2) evaluate the pathogenetic role of biologic markers of inflammation and lung injury and their value for refining risk stratification of patients at risk for progression to ALI, and 3) test the potential therapeutic value of an aerosolized beta-2 agonist in patients with early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 1 will identify cases of potential early ALI by screening chest radiographs of all adult emergency department and medicine service admissions. Patients admitted to the hospital with bilateral opacities on chest radiograph not due to isolated left atrial hypertension will be followed for progression to ALI during their hospitalization. Clinical characteristics (demographics, diagnoses, comorbidities, vital signs, and Borg dyspnea scores) will be recorded for the first 72 hours of admission. Independent predictors of progression to ALI will be determined by multivariate logistic regression and incorporated into a clinical definition of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 2, plasma levels of biomarkers (IL-8, sTNFr-1, vWF, ICAM-1, SP-D and RAGE) representing distinct pathways contributing to acute lung injury will be measured at time 0 and 24 hours after study enrollment. Biomarkers will be analyzed by multivariate regression analysis to assess their value for stratifying patients at risk for progression to ALI and provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 3 I will conduct a randomized clinical trial of aerosoUzed albuterol vs. placebo in patients with early ALI. The primary endpoint will be the Pa02 / Fi02 on day 4 of treatment. Secondary outcome measures will be rate of progression to ALI and change in plasma biologic marker levels. This will be a first-of-its-kind trial to establish that patients with early ALI can be identified and treatment can be initiated prior to need for mechanical ventilation. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Following the paradigm of early goal-directed therapy for severe sepsis, clinical benefit may derive from identifying patients with early ALI and initiating treatment prior to the need for mechanical ventilation (and therefore prior to meeting current study entry criteria). Establishing evidence based clinical definition of early ALI will facilitate identification and risk stratification of subjects for enrollment in future clinical trials.

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.              Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems.

"Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care? This Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award proposal describes the 5-year training program for Dr. Elliott R. Haut. The proposal builds upon the candidate's strengths and prior research skills, while utilizing the unique opportunities of The Johns Hopkins University. The mentorship of Dr. Peter Pronovost and formal advanced degree coursework in the Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation (GTPCI), will give Dr. Haut the tools and training to advance to the level of a fully independent health services researcher.  Pay for performance and public reporting of quality are growing exponentially in medicine. Implicit in these systems is the assumed presence of a valid way to measure clinical quality. Many national agencies (AHRQ, NQF) have suggested deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence as a metric of health care quality. DVT is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, yet may be completely asymptomatic until the clot embolizes and causes sudden death from massive pulmonary embolism. Duplex ultrasound serves an important role as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DVT detection. However, screening asymptomatic trauma patients for DVT is controversial, these practices likely vary widely among hospitals, and no national agency has recommended a standardized screening approach. In the absence of standardized surveillance, DVT rates may be influenced more by how often caregivers look for these events rather than the quality of care provided. This is a classic example of surveillance bias in which event rates identified and reported may merely reflect levels of vigilance. Higher DVT rates may not be a marker of poor quality of care, but rather an outcome of more aggressive screening practices. Providers who look harder by ordering more screening duplex ultrasounds, may report higher rates of DVT, and appear to provide poorer quality of care than those providers who do not screen. Therefore, DVT rates reported may be unreliable measures of quality of care and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives.  SA#1 will examine the impact of hospital-level ultrasound rates on DVT rates reported after major trauma.  SA#2 will determine whether hospital duplex and DVT rates correlate with the presence of a hospital duplex ultrasound screening protocol for high-risk trauma patients.  SA#3 will determine if patients are more likely to have DVT diagnosed and reported based on hospital characteristics, controlling for patient-level DVT risk factors using multi-level multiple logistic regression. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Some hospitals use duplex ultrasound to screen asymptomatic trauma patients for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while other hospitals do not. Hospitals that screen trauma patients may identify and report higher DVT rates merely because they search for DVTs more aggressively.Therefore, reported DVT rates are unreliable quality of care measures and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives. n/a",Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?,8259038,K08HS017952,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K08,2012,154570,0.005275610538745387
"Psychiatric Epidemiology: Racial Disparities among Vulnerable Populations with De DESCRIPTION (Abstract Provided by Applicant): Remarkably little is known about protective factors that reduce African Americans' risk for depression and diabetes comorbidity. In particular, the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans has never been demonstrated with a nationally representative sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences. The lack of research on depression and diabetes comorbidity research among African Americans is due primarily to rather small samples of Black Americans in available data sets from which to draw meaningful conclusions. The proposed research plan aims to provide a comprehensive examination of whether socioeconomic status (SES) and known risk and protective factors are correlated with reductions in the risk for comorbid depression and diabetes with special attention to low income populations in a nationally representative sample of 5,191 African Americans and Caribbean Blacks. The public health significance lies in specifying which demographic factors related to lower comorbidity risk, which will inform subsequent health social service prevention interventions and strategies. The present study plan is designed to advance knowledge and make five important contributions to the literature on depression and diabetes comorbidity among African Americans, namely by: (1) capitalizing on the strengths of a large, nationally representative data set, the National Survey of American Life [NSAL]; (2) determining whether SES is associated with reductions in the risk for the studied comorbid condition by Blacks; (3) examining the mediation effects of health insurance status on the relationship between SES and comorbid depression and diabetes conditions; (4) investigating the relative effects of comorbid status on employment outcomes for welfare recipients; and (5) describing the cultural meaning of being diagnosed with and managing health care with a comorbid diagnosis. The data analytic approaches to be used include logistic regression, multi-nominal logistic regression, and qualitative theme analyses techniques. Project Narrative Comorbid depression and diabetes is recognized as a condition that is costly to the health care system and is a vital topic of public health concern. Remarkably, few investigations focus on the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans with this comorbid condition. Moreover, no studies have demonstrated variable linkages with a nationally representative African American sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences until this one. The Surgeon General's report (2001), ""Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity - A supplement to mental health,"" highlighted understanding the protective and risk factors for comorbid conditions among Blacks, as an emergent public health research priority n/a",Psychiatric Epidemiology: Racial Disparities among Vulnerable Populations with De,8529009,K22MD003934,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'African Caribbean', 'Age', 'American', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Career Transition Award', 'Client', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Cultural Diversity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Employment', 'Employment Status', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Income', 'Inequality', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Mediation', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Plant Roots', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Provider', 'Public Assistance', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Social Health Services', 'Social Welfare', 'Social Work', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uninsured', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'information gathering', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'programs', 'public health research', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'trend']",NIMHD,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT ALBANY,K22,2012,159270,-0.010835131023721075
"Machine Learning Tools for Prognostication in Melanoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.  Cutaneous melanoma is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and its incidence rate is increasing faster than any other cancer. Nearly 69,000 new cases are expected be diagnosed in this country in 2010. While thin melanomas are typically cured with excision alone, thicker melanomas have a greater tendency to metastasize to the regional lymph nodes.  A diagnosis of Stage III melanoma is made if there is spread to the regional lymph nodes. Unfortunately, there is marked diversity in the natural history of Stage III melanoma, and outcomes within this group are extremely heterogeneous, with 5- year survival rates ranging from 23% to 87%. Similarly, treatment options range from intensive forms of systemic therapy to observation. Understanding patients' differences in clinical outcome is critical not only for calibrating therapeutic intensity to metastatic risk but also in the design and analysis of clinical trials.  There is a real void of reliable prognostic tools for Stage III melanoma. Based on novel machine learning approaches, the purpose of this study will be to develop and validate a reliable and individualized tool for prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients that can be used in the clinical setting.

"Assessing Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules With Electrical Impedance Measurements    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid nodules are present in a large fraction of healthy individuals. Between 4% and 7% of the United States adult population has palpable thyroid nodules, and up to 50% of American women older than age 50 have nodules that can be depicted on ultrasound. The vast majority (>95%) of thyroid nodules are benign. However, cancer risk increases with male gender, nodule size, extremes of age (< 30 and > 60 years), underlying autoimmune disease, nodule growth, personal or family history of thyroid cancer, and radiation exposure. Ultrasound imaging and Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) remain the mainstays of thyroid nodule evaluation. Unfortunately, 25% of patients who ultimately undergo FNAB of a thyroid nodule have indeterminate cytology. Many of these patients will require at least partial thyroidectomy purely for the purpose of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Given that only 30% of these will ultimately prove to be malignant on surgical pathology, the majority of these lobectomies could potentially be avoided if better non-invasive methods existed to evaluate indeterminate nodules. Electrical Impedance Scanning (EIS) has been previously investigated for non-invasive evaluation of thyroid nodules. The overall diagnostic accuracy of EIS was encouraging but not sufficient for routine clinical use. We have developed a modified approach termed here Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) that should have substantially higher sensitivity and specificity for this very purpose. When using REIS technology to examine the breast, we obtained initial results that are significantly better in all respects than those obtained with traditional EIS. We believe that REIS technology will similarly improve the assessment of thyroid nodules. REIS hold promise as a reproducible modality for the risk stratification of the many patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules. It is a new non- invasive modality that may help reduce the number of diagnostic lobectomies and would be welcomed by patients with non-diagnostic FNA results. The purpose of this application is to design, assemble, and test in a preliminary clinical study a unique REIS based device for the assessment of thyroid nodules.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules. We will assess the ability of this technology to accurately characterize these indeterminate nodules as benign or malignant prior to a ""diagnostic"" surgery.

"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8301548,K23DK090304,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2012,172287,0.0030053587309862005
"Outcomes of Bariatric Surgery among Patients with Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine how bariatric surgery affects psychiatric and metabolic outcomes among patients with bipolar disorder (BD). BD patients are at increased risk of obesity and suffer increased rates of obesity-related comorbidities. They have an estimated 25 years life lost, largely due to cardiovascular disease. There is an urgent need for knowledge about how best to treat obesity and mitigate associated comorbidities among bipolar disorder patients. Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity. Although BD patients suffer disproportionately from obesity, there is virtually no published data on how bariatric surgery affects psychiatric or metabolic course in this population. We propose a retrospective cohort study to examine psychiatric and metabolic outcomes during up to 3 years follow-up among all H100,000 morbidly obese adult patients (2000 BD, 13,000 major depressive disorder, 85,000 neither affective disorder) age 18-69 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California, between 2006 and 2009. Within the cohort, 5149 patients (171 BD, 1999 major depressive disorder, 2979 neither affective disorder) underwent bariatric surgery during the study period. We propose three aims: (1) Determine if predictors of referral to bariatric surgery, and of undergoing bariatric surgery, differ by affective disorder diagnosis (BD, major depressive disorder, neither); (2) Among n=2000 morbidly obese bipolar disorder patients who meet criteria for bariatric surgery, determine if bariatric surgery affects psychiatric course (risk of psychiatric hospitalization, outpatient psychiatric utilization); and (3) Among n=5149 patients who underwent bariatric surgery (171 BD, 1999 major depression, 2979 neither affective disorder), determine if affective disorder is associated with weight loss and metabolic outcomes (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia). We will employ longitudinal data representation from the counterfactual statistical framework. Multiple linear regression will be employed for linear outcomes (weight loss, number of outpatient visits), and multiple logistic regression will be employed for dichotomous outcomes. This study will be the first to present data on outcomes of bariatric surgery among bipolar disorder patients. Current, there are no BD-specific data on which to base clinic decision making in this population. As the excess mortality in BD is largely due to cardiovascular disease, this study will provide essential information to guide clinical decision making for morbidly obese BD patients and their physicians.        People with bipolar disorder suffer higher risk of obesity and associated diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We propose to study how the most effective obesity therapy, bariatric surgery, affects psychiatric course, weight loss, and improvement in obesity-associated diseases (diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol) among bipolar disorder patients. Ours will be the first study of bariatric surgery outcomes in bipolar disorder, and will provided much-needed information to help bipolar disorder patients and their physicians make decisions about treatment options for morbid obesity.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.        This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests). The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling.

"Cumulative Glycemic Burden and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Type 2 Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to provide evidence that prolonged, continuous, tight glycemic control, initiated when type 2 diabetes (DM) is first diagnosed and maintained throughout patients' DM lifetime, can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Current recommendations on care for persons with DM include tight glycated hemoglobin (A1C) control (<7%) as a means to reduce risk of CVD and other complications. Recent studies raised questions about this recommendation by failing to demonstrate that tight A1C control provides CV benefit in persons with DM, but these studies could not account for glycemic control prior to trial initiation. Other research supports the benefit of tight glycemic control over time, and suggests that even moderately elevated A1C levels in the 'normal' range indicate long-term CVD risk. To address these seemingly contradictory perspectives on how to optimize DM care, we propose to test the hypothesis that tight glycemic control does indeed reduce CVD risk, if begun early and continued throughout the course of DM. We will also assess whether cumulative glycemic burden over time, predict long-term CVD risk better than current A1C level or mean A1C over time, and to identify threshold levels of cumulative glycemic burden at which CVD risk becomes markedly elevated, among persons with DM. We will conduct the proposed analyses using data from the Kaiser Permanente Northwest Diabetes Registry. Since 1988, KPNW has developed and maintained this highly specific, sensitive, data-rich registry of members with DM; as of December 2009, it contained data on >70,000 persons. Among adults who joined the registry in 1995-2010, we will identify individuals who experienced a CVD event and match them to 5 controls who did not. We will then conduct multivariate logistic regression analyses of the extent to which A1C, mean A1C, and cumulative A1C burden predict time until first CVD event, and describe differences in the odds of CVD from date of DM diagnosis through 2010, to identify cut-points (of A1C, mean A1C over time, and cumulative glycemic burden levels) where CVD risk increases. The clinical application of such findings would lie in proving what has long been suspected - that cumulative glycemic burden is a critical CVD risk factor - thus providing critical support for the importance of initiating tight glycemic control immediately upon DM diagnosis and maintaining such control rigorously. No previous studies have evaluated cumulative glycemic burden as an indicator of CVD risk in DM, alone or in comparison to mean A1C over time, despite cumulative burden's biological plausibility as a CVD risk factor. The proposed work builds on our previous development of methods for measuring cumulative glycemic burden.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will use existing data on Kaiser Permanente Northwest members with diabetes from 1995- 2010 to assess whether control of high blood sugar, if begun early and continued over time, reduces cardiovascular disease risk. We will use a novel measure of high blood sugar, glycemic burden, which accounts for how high blood sugar is and how long it has been high.

"Natural Course of Cannabis Use Disorders from Childhood Through Early Adulthood    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In many countries cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug. In the United States, adolescence and early adulthood are particularly critical periods for the initiation of cannabis use and the development of cannabis use disorders (CUDs). A recent survey of high school youth, for example, indicated that more than 2 out of 5 12th grade students have used cannabis. Similarly, based on findings from a recent national survey, researchers estimated that 2.4 million U.S. residents aged 12 years or older initiated cannabis during the prior year, and that during the same 12-month period about 4.3 million residents (or 1.7% of the U.S. population) either abused or were dependent on cannabis. Despite the importance of CUDs as a public health concern, important gaps in knowledge remain concerning the development and course of CUDs in the general population. To address these gaps, the proposed research will document several important features associated with the natural course of CUDs. To accomplish these research aims, an existing data set from the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project (OADP) will be analyzed. The OADP is a community-based and multi- generational longitudinal study that spans the peak period for the emergence of sustained patterns of hazardous cannabis use, from adolescence through early adulthood.  The research described in this application will address several cannabis-related topics not previously addressed in prior OADP publications. Five broad areas are emphasized that integrate OADP's longitudinal and developmental features. (1) The prevalence of CUDs in the OADP sample will be reported, and hazards functions that describe the time to recovery from the initial CUDs episode, the probability of relapse, and the time to disorder recurrence will also be provided. (2) Subgroups of persons will be identified based on the developmental course of CUDs over the lifetime, and childhood risk factors and adult psychosocial outcomes associated with distinct trajectory subgroups will be reported. (3) The parental transmission of CUD risk will be evaluated and documented. (4) Childhood and adolescent psychiatric risk factors for later CUDs will be evaluated with proportional hazards functions and logistic regression approaches. (5) Proportional hazards modeling and logistic regression approaches will be used to evaluate the psychiatric outcomes of CUD episodes. Findings from this proposed research have the potential to inform theories of the epidemiology of CUDs, aid the development of screening tools to identify youth who are at risk for future CUDs, facilitate the development of targeted prevention programs and therapeutic interventions, and reduce the likelihood of relapse once beneficial behavior change has occurred.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is consistent with two strategic goals of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). (1) To prevent the initiation of cannabis use and the development of cannabis use disorders (CUDs) by identifying patterns of abuse and associated psychosocial risk factors, including family factors. (2) To evaluate the potential influence of other psychiatric disorders in the development of CUDs.           The proposed research is consistent with two strategic goals of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).

"Medication Intervention in Transitional Care to Optimize CKD Outcomes & Costs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary Transitional care interventions reduce hospital readmissions and slow the progression of declining health in the general population of hospitalized patients. What is not known is the impact transitional care interventions can have for the hospitalized CKD population. CKD patients are in critical need of improved transitional care that includes accurate and comprehensive medication information transfer. The main objective of this application is to pilot-test the effectiveness of a medication information transfer intervention to improve clinically-relevant outcomes in CKD. To this end, the following Specific Aims will be achieved: 1. Evaluate the impact of transitional care interventions on acute care utilization following hospital discharge among patients with CKD. 2. Evaluate the impact of transitional care strategies on management of CKD risk factors and complications. Focus groups will first be conducted to assure relevance and to refine the intervention. A qualitative research design with convenience sampling will be used to survey recently hospitalized CKD patients (n~10) and their healthcare professionals (n~10). The medication information transfer intervention will be evaluated in a pilot study using a randomized, single-blind clinical trial design. Participants and the pharmacist interventionist will have knowledge of group assignment, but the other investigators and research staff will be blinded. Study entry criteria will include hospitalized patients >21 years old (n=120) who have a diagnosis of CKD stages 3-5 (not including those treated by dialysis or kidney transplant). After obtaining IRB-approved written informed consent, patients will be randomized by computer algorithm for group assignment, stratifying according to diabetes status. The pharmacist will visit participants in the home within 5 days of hospital discharge. The 5As (Assessment, Advice, Agreement, Assistance, and Arrangements) Self-Management Model will be used to implement the medication information transfer intervention. Clinical assessments will be performed at baseline and at 30 and 90 days. Primary outcome measures for Specific Aim 1 will be acute care utilization (emergency department visits and hospitalizations). The main outcomes for Specific Aim 2 will be measures of CKD risk factors and complications. Blood pressure will be the primary outcome for this aim because hypertension control is the most consistent recommendation for slowing CKD progression. Logistic regression analyses will be employed controlling for age, sex, CKD stage, co- morbidities, Charleson score, cognitive status, medication adherence and health literacy. Cost will be analyzed based on charges from hospitalization through the following 90 days using a difference-of- difference approach. This contribution is significant because it will define methods to overcome system barriers that result in impaired quality and continuity of care. The proposed research is innovative because it integrates established clinical strategies with systems approaches to improve patient care, thereby testing a fundamentally new approach to advance CKD management.          Project narrative the proposed research is relevant to public health because it will positively impact a common, deadly, and costly chronic disease - CKD - by reducing acute care utilization and costs as well as by improving outpatient management. This medication information transfer intervention in the transitional care of hospitalized CKD patients will have wide-appeal for adoption by healthcare systems and for other chronic illnesses. The project supports the mission of NIDDK by translating lessons learned from clinical research in CKD into improved clinical outcomes that can be readily measured and anticipated in practice.

"Guideline-based surveillance and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest rising cause of cancer-related deaths. Survival following diagnosis with HCC is poor unless it is detected early and stage-appropriate treatment is applied. Clinical practice guidelines outline recommendations for HCC surveillance and treatment of HCC. No study has examined the implementation or outcomes of guideline-based HCC surveillance in high risk patients or stage- appropriate treatment in patients who develop HCC. OBJECTIVES: Using data obtained from VA administrative databases combined with information abstracted from national VA electronic medical records using the VA Compensation and Pension Record Interchange application, we propose to address the following Aims: 1) to examine the implementation of guideline-based HCC surveillance in a national sample of patients with cirrhosis, and to examine patient, physician and facility factors associated with appropriate or inappropriate implementation of surveillance; 2) to evaluate the implementation of guideline-based stage-appropriate treatment among patients with HCC, and to examine patient, physician, and facility factors associated with receipt of stage-appropriate treatment; and 3) to examine the effect of guideline-based HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment on survival. METHODS: We propose a retrospective cohort study using two stratified random samples of approximately 1,500 patients with cirrhosis and 1,500 patients with HCC diagnosed during 2006-2009 in VA facilities nationwide. For Aim 1, the outcome will be appropriate (guideline-based surveillance, receipt of an imaging test unrelated to HCC surveillance, no surveillance) versus inappropriate (non-guideline based surveillance, overutilization of surveillance) implementation of HCC surveillance among patients with one of the four primary etiologies for cirrhosis (hepatitis C, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis B, alcoholic liver disease). Patient, physician, and facility factors associated with appropriate implementation of HCC surveillance will be examined using logistic regression. For Aim 2, the outcome will be receipt of stage-appropriate HCC treatment versus stage-inappropriate treatment or no treatment among patients with HCC. Each patient will be assigned to a stage-appropriate treatment category according to current guidelines, which will be compared against the treatment received. Logistic regression will be used to examine predictors of receiving stage-appropriate treatment. For Aim 3, the outcome will be survival among patients with cirrhosis who developed HCC. Receipt of appropriate HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment will be the primary predictors of interest. Marginal structural modeling will be used to examine these associations. IMPACT: This study will examine an important and timely issue in the management of HCC that has not been examined. Findings from this study will provide a strong foundation for developing and implementing a future intervention to improve the delivery of guideline-based HCC surveillance and treatment.        Outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma are poor. Practice guidelines have been developed to guide physicians in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma, from surveillance in patients at high risk to treatment in those who develop this disease. This study proposes to evaluate the implementation of guideline-based surveillance and treatment recommendations for hepatocellular carcinoma and their effect on survival, as well as consider patient, physician, and facility factors that may be associated with appropriate or inappropriate implementation of these guidelines.

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units  Project Summary  Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.  The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.  We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting the incorporation continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.  If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and ehance the efficiency in a neurocritical care.  Project Narrative The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorparation of continous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecaststs that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury. Therefore, their successful forecast can lead to a paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and ehance the efficiency in a neurocritical care.",Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units,8256763,R01NS066008,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain scan', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebral Ventricles', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Professional', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prophylactic', 'time interval']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2012,330138,0.02008805681658296
"Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contradiction of early cancer detection is that while some benefit others receive a detrimental diagnosis. A definitive example is mammography and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS, which most frequently presents as a non-palpable lesion, was rarely detected before the advent of modern mammography. Since 1983 there has been a 290% increase in DCIS incidence in women under 50 and 500% in those over 50. Given that only 5-10% of DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer with a 10-year mortality rate of 1-2%, DCIS experts suggest breast conservation for the majority of patients. However, these women continue to be overtreated with mastectomy and radiation, at rates comparable to those with invasive cancer. The inability to discern those at low vs. high risk is due in part to non-reproducible study results as well as inadequate statistical methods for risk prediction and validation.  We have collected a population-based DCIS cohort with the goal of delineating those women least likely to recur with invasive cancer and, hence, appropriate candidates for less aggressive treatments. Recently we established risk indices and published the corresponding absolute risk estimates for type of recurrence. However, two features of the study design, namely the presence of competing risks and the use of a stratified case-cohort design, constrained us to using crude empirical methods for analysis and left us unable to validate the clinical utility of our models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a unified, principled statistical framework for building, selecting, and evaluating clinically relevant risk indices, permitting refinement and validation of existing risk prediction models in our DCIS study as well as beyond.  We face multiple challenges including how to objectively build risk indices with relevant variables; how to estimate the corresponding risks (competing or not) in various subsample study designs; and, how to validate the resulting risk prediction models. Recently, we developed partDSA, a tree-based method which affords tremendous flexibility in building predictive models and provides an ideal foundation for developing a clinician- friendly tool for accurate stratification and risk prediction. In its curret form, partDSA is unable to estimate absolute risk in the presence of competing risks accounting for subsample study designs. Here we extend partDSA for such clinically relevant scenarios (Aim 1). We also propose aggregate learning for risk prediction to increase prediction accuracy and subsequently to build more stable but easily interpretable risk models (Aim 2). Finally, we propose the necessary methods for validating the resulting models (Aim 3).  Our proposal has two immediate public health benefits: first, these novel statistical methods will result in a clinician-friendly, publicly available tool for accurate risk prediction, stratification and validaion in numerous clinical settings; second, current DCIS risk models will be refined and validated with the expectation of better delineating those at low risk, hence strong candidates for conservative treatments including active surveillance.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.              Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.            ",Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction,8373032,R01CA163687,"['Accounting', 'Anxiety', 'Breast', 'Carcinoma', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Benefit', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Mastectomy', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Screening for cancer', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'breast lumpectomy', 'cancer risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'loss of function', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'simulation', 'tool']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2012,335601,-0.052177821778385605
"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.                  Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials.

"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.

"Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health-care acquired pneumonia (HCAP) is a newly-recognized clinical entity which has a higher morbidity and mortality than community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Patients with HCAP are at risk for multi-drug resistant organisms due to past healthcare exposures such as recent hospitalizations, nursing homes, and dialysis units, and tend to have a high burden of co-morbid illnesses. The 2005 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend that patients diagnosed with HCAP be treated initially with 3 broad- spectrum antibiotics; however, the evidence behind these recommendations comes from several small observational trials. These studies show that compared to patients with CAP, patients with HCAP have higher mortality and are more likely to be treated with inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy, but it is not known whether widespread use of several broad-spectrum agents will improve patient outcomes. Because these antibiotics can cause serious side effects and are often expensive, physicians may be hesitant to prescribe according to the guidelines without more evidence of their comparative effectiveness. We will conduct a retrospective cohort study using highly detailed patient-level claims and microbiological data contained in the Perspective data warehouse (PREMIER Healthcare Inc.) from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 from 550 participating hospitals in the United States. We will examine data from hospitalized patients  = 18 years of age who were admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia. The aim of our study is to determine whether patients hospitalized for HCAP have worse outcomes than those admitted for CAP, whether differences in outcome are due to co-morbid illnesses or to resistant organisms, and whether HCAP patients who are treated with the empiric antibiotic regimen recommended by the ATS-IDSA guidelines have better outcomes (lower mortality, fewer complications, shorter length-of stay and lower costs) than patients treated with other antibiotics. Our study will use sophisticated statistical methods, including logistic regression, propensity matching and an adaptation of the instrumental variable approach, to adjust for pre- treatment differences between patients and compare the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens. Our results will help to guide physicians in the treatment of individual patients and aid experts in developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Information we discover about physician practice patterns will also help quality officers and policy-makers identify areas for improvement in the care of this common and deadly illness.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia"" will provide important insight into a clinical dilemma faced by physicians who care for as many as 300,000 patients each year with Healthcare-Associated pneumonia (HCAP). This study will assess whether patients with HCAP are receiving care consistent with the recommendations found in guidelines developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America, and whether those treated according to the guidelines have better outcomes than patients who are treated with other antibiotics. These results will help clinicians balance the potential benefits of the recommended antibiotics against the potential harms of antibiotic side effects, future antibiotic resistance, and increased costs. If recommended therapy is beneficial but underutilized, these results will alert quality improvement officers and policy makers to an important opportunity to improve patient care for a common and deadly illness.

"FT-IR Microscopy of Mineral Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is responsible for approximately 1.5 million fractures in the US per year, with 300,000 of these fractures occurring at the hip at a cost exceeding $17 billion. The NIH Consensus conference and the World Health Organization defined osteoporosis as ""...compromised bone strength predisposing to an increased risk of fracture"". A variety of genetic and environmental factors, as well as bone properties (geometric and material), contribute to the bone loss that is associated with osteoporosis, but the question remains as to which factors primarily contribute to fracture risk. While reduced bone mineral density (BMD) relative to young individuals is routinely used clinically to predict fracture risk, BMD is not a strong predictor, with the majority of fractures occurring in patients with BMD's above the osteoporotic threshold. We have recently shown by multiple logistic regression analysis that specific mineral and matrix properties assessed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging (FTIRI) are predictive of fracture in postmenopausal women, while BMD is not significantly associated with fracture incidence. In a limited number of samples we have also shown that these FTIR parameters are correlated with nanomechanical properties. We hypothesize that variation in crystallinity (XST) and collagen maturity (XLR) partially explains the difference in incidence of fractures in individuals with similar BMDs. We further hypothesize that heterogeneity in these parameters is an additional determinant of fracture incidence, especially in trabecular bone. In the proposed studies we will test 4 hypotheses. 1) For any subject, FTIRI data obtained in the cortical and cancellous bone of the iliac crest (generally a non-fracturing site) is representative of that from sites that fracture (subtrochanter/greater trochanter). Further, the data are independent of the size of the biopsy as long as cortical and cancellous bone areas are included. This will be tested using multiple biopsies from cadavers and from clinic patients with fractures. Measures will include micro-CT analysis of BMD and architecture, and FTIRI. 2) Decreased heterogeneity in FTIRI mineral and matrix properties, in addition to increased XST and XLR, are predictive of fracture in humans. This will be tested by extending our logistic regression to heterogeneity parameters. Variation in tissue properties with age will be studied in patients with idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. Tissue mechanical properties will be correlated with FTIRI data. 3) An anabolic agent (PTH) can restore mechanical properties, and the XST, XLR, and mineral and matrix heterogeneity in animal models as well as in osteoporotic humans. This will be tested by analyses of pre- and post- treatment human biopsies and by analyses in a sheep model. 4) XLR, which is altered in osteoporosis, is related to collagen orientation. As part of our continued parameter validation, this will be tested by comparing FTIRI and second harmonic heneration microscopy data. Testing of these four hypotheses will provide new insights into the efficacy of therapies and contribute to the understanding of factors leading to fracture.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this continuing investigation is to discover what changes in bone properties cause a bone in a person with osteoporosis to break; we have suggestive evidence that changes in the structure and composition of the bone composite (mineral and matrix) put bones at risk of breaking during normal activities of daily life. Correlations are sought between spatial variation in parameters obtained by vibrational spectroscopy and mechanical properties. This information should lead to improved diagnosis and new approaches to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, the ""silent epidemic"".

"Screening and Brief Intervention in the ED among Mexican-origin Young Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening and Brief Intervention in the ED among Mexican-origin Young Adults The aims of this application ""Screening and Brief Alcohol Intervention in Underage and Young Adult Populations"" are to: 1) examine the effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) among Mexican-origin young adults (age 18-25), using a motivational intervention delivered by a Health Promotion Advocate (promotore), relative to standard care with and without assessment, on a reduction in heavy drinking (drinking days per week, number of drinks per day, maximum number of drinks on an occasion) and alcohol-related problems (RAPS4 and SIPS +6) in the emergency department (ED) at the U.S.- Mexico border; and, 2) identify variables that are related to effectiveness of the intervention and that predict successful treatment outcome. We plan to translate motivational interventions that have been successful in primary care and which were recently implemented in the U.S. 14 Academic Emergency Medicine Collaborative (AEMC) SBIRT study to a population of young adult Mexican-origin ED patients on the Texas border in El Paso; a population which has evidenced a high prevalence of hazardous drinking and alcohol- related problems, in part due to the greater availability of alcohol and at low cost in Mexico border cities. The SBIRT study, funded by NIAAA and SAAMHSA, was the first multi-site, collaborative study of screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED. We will conduct a blinded randomized control brief motivational intervention trial in which both injured and non-injured patients will be screened for at- risk or dependent (using the RAPS4) drinking. Patients screening positive who consent to participate in the study will be randomized into one of three groups: screened only, assessed, and assessed plus brief intervention, with n=312 in each group. Intervention and assessment groups will be followed-up at 3 months and all three groups at 12 months. Modifying variables include drinking in the event, risk-taking disposition, readiness and stage of change, country of birth (U.S. vs. Mexico) and language in which the assessment and intervention were conducted (English vs. Spanish). Outcome data will be analyzed using ANOVA, logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations. The interaction of modifying variables on outcomes will also be analyzed. Additionally, the study will examine data relevant to key issues related to the potential translatability and public health impact of the intervention and next steps. Given the paucity of published studies of brief intervention in the ED among young adults in general, or among Mexican-origin adults, and none among Mexican-origin young adults, who may be most vulnerable to alcohol use problems and disorders, especially at the border, work to be undertaken in this application is especially important in determining the effectiveness of AEMC SBIRT protocols (which may serve as a prototype for screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED) in this context of Mexican-origin young adults.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work is especially relevant to public health in relation to reducing subsequent alcohol-related ED visits and associated costs and increase quality of life among young adults. The project will inform the development and spread of more effective techniques and protocols for addressing at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED in this age group, and provide a better understanding of those factors that influence effectiveness of brief intervention and predict successful patient outcomes across ethnic and cultural groups in the U.S. Additionally, this will be the first randomized controlled clinical trial compared to standard care of brief intervention using promotores in the Mexican-origin community, which may provide a better chance of ongoing implementation of SBIRT in the ED than using ED staff providers.

"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.  Narrative:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.",Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms,8206668,R01HL106545,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcified', 'Calcium', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'computer aided detection', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2012,585438,-0.04457623315812186
"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.              The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone.

The primary purpose of our proposed 5-year multisite randomized clinical trial, which is guided by the knowledge transfer framework, is to test the effect of implementing these standards on nurses' knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. We will also explore the sustainability of effects in the experimental group and the effect of the delayed intervention in the control group. We expect that increased knowledge and skills of nurses will lead to enhanced quality of care, which will result in improved outcomes for patients. Units serving cardiac patients in 16 hospitals will participate. Hospitals will be randomized to the experimental or control group after baseline measures of knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes are obtained. The intervention will include ECG monitoring education and strategies to implement and sustain change. The education will be Web-based and include 4 modules: essentials of ECG monitoring, arrhythmia monitoring, ischemia monitoring, and QT interval monitoring. The standardization of content, flexibility of use, immediate feedback in both practice and testing sections are advantages of Web-based education. The use of simulations to test skills makes our program innovative. The strategies to implement and sustain change in the clinical area include reinforcement of education, incentives, and the designation of  champions  on each unit who will actively promote the implementation of the practice standards. Statistical analyses will account for intra-cluster correlation at the hospital level. Most outcomes are categorical with 2 levels, whereas knowledge and skill scores are continuous. For categorical outcomes, two approaches will be considered: logistic regression models complemented with intra-cluster correlation using generalized estimating equations methods and extended Mantel-Haenszel cross-tabulation methods stratifying by cluster. For continuous outcomes, mixed modeling will be used to account for intra-cluster correlation through hierarchical linear models. We developed the new practice standards to improve hospital ECG monitoring. We expect that improved ECG monitoring will result in more accurate diagnosis and more timely treatment, which will lead to better outcomes for patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to test the effect of implementing new practice standards for electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring on nurses  knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. If implementation of the practice standards is associated with improvement in quality of care and patient outcomes, then there is the potential for improved care and outcomes for the literally millions of patients who require continuous ECG monitoring while hospitalized.          n/a",Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring,8245894,R01HL081642,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardioscopes', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Units', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Simulate', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular nursing', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'flexibility', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nursing skill', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,719562,0.021734089468340562
"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and  about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is  currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of  CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-  ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are,  they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms  2) Accommodative Mechanisms  3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms  There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term,  we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions  associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause. In phase t, we propose to:  ¿Clinically define CVS by observing the incidence of ocular surface abnormalities in symptomatic subjects  and compare them with an age and sex matched non-symptomatic control population  ¿Develop specialized micro-environment glasses to combat CVS symptoms  ¿Study the efficacy of micro-environment glasses in symptomatic and control populations  ¿Critically evaluate viability of CVS micro-environment glasses as a commercial product using both statistical   methods and subjective questionnaires n/a",Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS,8203808,R41EY015023,"['Address', 'Age', 'Asthenopia', 'Back', 'Blurred vision', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Burns', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Headache', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Neck', 'Pain', 'Phase', 'Population Control', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'Shoulder', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'combat', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'eye dryness', 'improved', 'ocular surface', 'sex']",NEI,"SEEFIT, INC.",R41,2011,47724,-0.04504840673186007
"Access to Liver Transplantation for Patients with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic liver disease that has no treatment and is an otherwise fatal disease without liver transplantation. Patients with PSC face unique complications as compared to other patients with end-stage liver disease, including cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), cholangitis from biliary strictures, and complications such as colon cancer from concomitant inflammatory bowel disease. The current model for allocation of livers, instituted on February 27th, 2002, relies on a patient's Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, which accounts for a patient's serum INR, creatinine, and bilirubin. The MELD score places more weight on the INR and creatinine, although in patients with PSC the bilirubin is disproportionately elevated. This fact, along with the fact that complications such as CCA are not captured by the MELD data elements, leads us to believe that the MELD score may place patients with PSC at a survival disadvantage. If this is true, then this may serve as a basis for a policy change in how livers are allocated. For patients with PSC on the waitlist, their risk of death may be higher for two reasons. Either the risk of death for a given MELD score is higher for patients with PSC, or in patients with PSC, the MELD score rises more slowly, making patients less likely to receive a transplant and thereby exposed for a longer duration to the risks of clinical deterioration and removal from the waitlist. Our first aim will address this primary research question in three ways. We will develop two Cox proportional hazard models, one accounting for all of a patient's MELD scores while on the waitlist, and another adjusting only for MELD at listing. We will also perform logistic regression to evaluate the clinically important outcome of death vs. transplant. Our second aim will serve to determine the frequencies with which potential liver transplant recipients are removed from the waitlist due to clinical deterioration among those in whom the reasons for withdrawal are unspecified in UNOS data. By collecting patient level data from individual transplant centers, we will be able to calculate the extent of this outcome misclassification and thereby guide quantitative sensitivity analyses of our primary models in Aim I. Lastly, we will evaluate whether introduction of the MELD system for liver allocation was associated with changes in rates of living donor liver transplantation among patients with PSC relative to corresponding rates among patients without PSC. This analysis is needed as differential rates of referral for living donor transplant among patients with and without PSC could affect the extent to which diagnosis may influence the outcomes in Aim I. The proposed research project will be in the context of the applicant working towards a Masters of Science in Clinical Epidemiology, whereby didactic learning in the classroom, focusing on fundamentals of epidemiology, study design, and statistical and analytic methods of research will enhance and guide the research process of the applicant. The long-term objectives of the applicant for this project are to collect and analyze the data, prepare manuscripts for publication, and build upon the data as part of a future application for a K award.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The allocation of organs for liver transplantation has major public health implications in that decisions must be made as to how we allocate a scarce resource. It is critical that we practice within a system that is equitable, and does not disadvantage one group of patients as a result of their disease status. If it is found that patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis are disadvantaged by the current liver allocation system, then this will form a foundation for which large-scale policy changes are considered to bring about a fairer system of organ transplantation.           Project Narrative/Relevance The allocation of organs for liver transplantation has major public health implications in that decisions must be made as to how we allocate a scarce resource.

"Claims-based surveillance of surgical site infections following vascular surgery.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop and validate a standardized, claims-based surveillance method to rank hospitals nationally based on diagnosis and procedure codes suggestive of surgical site infection (SSI) following vascular surgery. This work will be part of an ongoing collaboration between the Harvard-based CDC Prevention Epicenter, the CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The first aim is to develop a set of diagnosis and procedure codes that suggest SSI following vascular surgery. We will perform a retrospective cohort study of Medicare patients who underwent one of the vascular procedures targeted by the national Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) in 2005. Approximately 100 codes that have been pre-selected as SSI indicators will be pilot tested in five CDC Prevention Epicenter hospitals using full medical record review. We will use the pilot test to refine our code list to ensure a sensitivity of at least 90% for all confirmed SSIs while attempting to maximize specificity. The second aim is to apply our refined claims-based surveillance method to the 2005-2008 Medicare national claims database. We will rank all hospitals that performed at least 200 targeted vascular procedures in Medicare patients between 2005 and 2008 (average of 50 procedures per year). Ranking will be based on the fraction of patients at each individual hospital with>1 SSI indicator according to the claims-based surveillance method. Rankings will adjust for age, gender, and Romano comorbidity score via a generalized linear mixed model that controls for clustering within institutions. Hospitals will be grouped into deciles based on their adjusted SSI rates. Finally, the third aim is to validate the ranking of hospitals in the best and worst deciles based upon nationwide review of up to 1,500 full-text records. We will perform logistic regression to assess the relationship between having a vascular surgery performed in a best versus worst deciles hospital while controlling for case mix.          Project Narrative   This partnership with CMS and CDC will enhance the national effort to identify hospitals with potentially elevated surgical site infection rates following high volume procedures. We seek to develop a standardized and less resource intensive system that will allow routine identification of hospitals with unusually high rates of these complications. This information will allow targeting of CMS and other resources to improve quality of care  by focusing on hospitals with the greatest need and potential for improvement.",Claims-based surveillance of surgical site infections following vascular surgery.,8101014,F32HS018878,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,F32,2011,69107,0.009021234015830057
"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,8077374,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'high risk', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2011,105194,0.006245088590132478
"Early Acute Lung Injury: Prospective Evaluation Prior to Respiratory Failure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary and non-pulmonary insults and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite two decades of targeted investigation by the NHLBI, little is known about ALI prior to progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Accordingly, the aims of this research plan are to: 1) prospectively identify independent predictors of progression to ALI requiring mechanical ventilation and establish a clinical definition of early ALI; 2) evaluate the pathogenetic role of biologic markers of inflammation and lung injury and their value for refining risk stratification of patients at risk for progression to ALI, and 3) test the potential therapeutic value of an aerosolized beta-2 agonist in patients with early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 1 will identify cases of potential early ALI by screening chest radiographs of all adult emergency department and medicine service admissions. Patients admitted to the hospital with bilateral opacities on chest radiograph not due to isolated left atrial hypertension will be followed for progression to ALI during their hospitalization. Clinical characteristics (demographics, diagnoses, comorbidities, vital signs, and Borg dyspnea scores) will be recorded for the first 72 hours of admission. Independent predictors of progression to ALI will be determined by multivariate logistic regression and incorporated into a clinical definition of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 2, plasma levels of biomarkers (IL-8, sTNFr-1, vWF, ICAM-1, SP-D and RAGE) representing distinct pathways contributing to acute lung injury will be measured at time 0 and 24 hours after study enrollment. Biomarkers will be analyzed by multivariate regression analysis to assess their value for stratifying patients at risk for progression to ALI and provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 3 I will conduct a randomized clinical trial of aerosoUzed albuterol vs. placebo in patients with early ALI. The primary endpoint will be the Pa02 / Fi02 on day 4 of treatment. Secondary outcome measures will be rate of progression to ALI and change in plasma biologic marker levels. This will be a first-of-its-kind trial to establish that patients with early ALI can be identified and treatment can be initiated prior to need for mechanical ventilation. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Following the paradigm of early goal-directed therapy for severe sepsis, clinical benefit may derive from identifying patients with early ALI and initiating treatment prior to the need for mechanical ventilation (and therefore prior to meeting current study entry criteria). Establishing evidence based clinical definition of early ALI will facilitate identification and risk stratification of subjects for enrollment in future clinical trials.

"Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award proposal describes the 5-year training program for Dr. Elliott R. Haut. The proposal builds upon the candidate's strengths and prior research skills, while utilizing the unique opportunities of The Johns Hopkins University. The mentorship of Dr. Peter Pronovost and formal advanced degree coursework in the Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation (GTPCI), will give Dr. Haut the tools and training to advance to the level of a fully independent health services researcher. Pay for performance and public reporting of quality are growing exponentially in medicine. Implicit in these systems is the assumed presence of a valid way to measure clinical quality. Many national agencies (AHRQ, NQF) have suggested deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence as a metric of health care quality. DVT is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, yet may be completely asymptomatic until the clot embolizes and causes sudden death from massive pulmonary embolism. Duplex ultrasound serves an important role as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DVT detection. However, screening asymptomatic trauma patients for DVT is controversial, these practices likely vary widely among hospitals, and no national agency has recommended a standardized screening approach. In the absence of standardized surveillance, DVT rates may be influenced more by how often caregivers look for these events rather than the quality of care provided. This is a classic example of surveillance bias in which event rates identified and reported may merely reflect levels of vigilance. Higher DVT rates may not be a marker of poor quality of care, but rather an outcome of more aggressive screening practices. Providers who look harder by ordering more screening duplex ultrasounds, may report higher rates of DVT, and appear to provide poorer quality of care than those providers who do not screen. Therefore, DVT rates reported may be unreliable measures of quality of care and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives. SA#1 will examine the impact of hospital-level ultrasound rates on DVT rates reported after major trauma. SA#2 will determine whether hospital duplex and DVT rates correlate with the presence of a hospital duplex ultrasound screening protocol for high-risk trauma patients. SA#3 will determine if patients are more likely to have DVT diagnosed and reported based on hospital characteristics, controlling for patient-level DVT risk factors using multi-level multiple logistic regression. Some hospitals use duplex ultrasound to screen asymptomatic trauma patients for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while other hospitals do not. Hospitals that screen trauma patients may identify and report higher DVT rates merely because they search for DVTs more aggressively. Therefore, reported DVT rates are unreliable quality of care measures and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives.             n/a",Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?,8066783,K08HS017952,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K08,2011,154862,0.005117968571602528
"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education  with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in  clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic  kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral  funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an  independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD  care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician  (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on  experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research,  and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop  into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the  development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors.  In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and  large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel-  Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and  commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher.   An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his  research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and  the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to  develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum  chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed  logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will  conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model  in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients  for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with  an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care  delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data  mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and  implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher.   In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance  provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is  a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD.  Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of  Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in  predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical  informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a  highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise  in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the  general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and  CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of  disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models.  This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and  expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training.   To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal  coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical  Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational  Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial  implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research  and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses  that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills.   In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a  sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to  use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The  applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the  formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful  independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder.  Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor  health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney  disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen  high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially  improve the care of these patients.        Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder.

"Outcomes of Bariatric Surgery among Patients with Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine how bariatric surgery affects psychiatric and metabolic outcomes among patients with bipolar disorder (BD). BD patients are at increased risk of obesity and suffer increased rates of obesity-related comorbidities. They have an estimated 25 years life lost, largely due to cardiovascular disease. There is an urgent need for knowledge about how best to treat obesity and mitigate associated comorbidities among bipolar disorder patients. Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity. Although BD patients suffer disproportionately from obesity, there is virtually no published data on how bariatric surgery affects psychiatric or metabolic course in this population. We propose a retrospective cohort study to examine psychiatric and metabolic outcomes during up to 3 years follow-up among all H100,000 morbidly obese adult patients (2000 BD, 13,000 major depressive disorder, 85,000 neither affective disorder) age 18-69 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California, between 2006 and 2009. Within the cohort, 5149 patients (171 BD, 1999 major depressive disorder, 2979 neither affective disorder) underwent bariatric surgery during the study period. We propose three aims: (1) Determine if predictors of referral to bariatric surgery, and of undergoing bariatric surgery, differ by affective disorder diagnosis (BD, major depressive disorder, neither); (2) Among n=2000 morbidly obese bipolar disorder patients who meet criteria for bariatric surgery, determine if bariatric surgery affects psychiatric course (risk of psychiatric hospitalization, outpatient psychiatric utilization); and (3) Among n=5149 patients who underwent bariatric surgery (171 BD, 1999 major depression, 2979 neither affective disorder), determine if affective disorder is associated with weight loss and metabolic outcomes (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia). We will employ longitudinal data representation from the counterfactual statistical framework. Multiple linear regression will be employed for linear outcomes (weight loss, number of outpatient visits), and multiple logistic regression will be employed for dichotomous outcomes. This study will be the first to present data on outcomes of bariatric surgery among bipolar disorder patients. Current, there are no BD-specific data on which to base clinic decision making in this population. As the excess mortality in BD is largely due to cardiovascular disease, this study will provide essential information to guide clinical decision making for morbidly obese BD patients and their physicians.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: People with bipolar disorder suffer higher risk of obesity and associated diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We propose to study how the most effective obesity therapy, bariatric surgery, affects psychiatric course, weight loss, and improvement in obesity-associated diseases (diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol) among bipolar disorder patients. Ours will be the first study of bariatric surgery outcomes in bipolar disorder, and will provided much-needed information to help bipolar disorder patients and their physicians make decisions about treatment options for morbid obesity.           People with bipolar disorder suffer higher risk of obesity and associated diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

"Machine Learning Tools for Prognostication in Melanoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.  Cutaneous melanoma is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and its incidence rate is increasing faster than any other cancer. Nearly 69,000 new cases are expected be diagnosed in this country in 2010. While thin melanomas are typically cured with excision alone, thicker melanomas have a greater tendency to metastasize to the regional lymph nodes.  A diagnosis of Stage III melanoma is made if there is spread to the regional lymph nodes. Unfortunately, there is marked diversity in the natural history of Stage III melanoma, and outcomes within this group are extremely heterogeneous, with 5- year survival rates ranging from 23% to 87%. Similarly, treatment options range from intensive forms of systemic therapy to observation. Understanding patients' differences in clinical outcome is critical not only for calibrating therapeutic intensity to metastatic risk but also in the design and analysis of clinical trials.  There is a real void of reliable prognostic tools for Stage III melanoma. Based on novel machine learning approaches, the purpose of this study will be to develop and validate a reliable and individualized tool for prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients that can be used in the clinical setting.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.           The purpose of the study is to develop and validate a tool for reliable individualized prognostication of Stage III melanoma patients for use in the clinical setting.         ",Machine Learning Tools for Prognostication in Melanoma,8114413,R21CA152775,"['Address', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logic', 'Lymph Node Dissections', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metastatic to', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Natural History', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nodal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'editorial', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'hazard', 'lymph nodes', 'melanoma', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2011,193798,-0.023556595550203906
"Assessing Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules With Electrical Impedance Measurements    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid nodules are present in a large fraction of healthy individuals. Between 4% and 7% of the United States adult population has palpable thyroid nodules, and up to 50% of American women older than age 50 have nodules that can be depicted on ultrasound. The vast majority (>95%) of thyroid nodules are benign. However, cancer risk increases with male gender, nodule size, extremes of age (< 30 and > 60 years), underlying autoimmune disease, nodule growth, personal or family history of thyroid cancer, and radiation exposure. Ultrasound imaging and Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) remain the mainstays of thyroid nodule evaluation. Unfortunately, 25% of patients who ultimately undergo FNAB of a thyroid nodule have indeterminate cytology. Many of these patients will require at least partial thyroidectomy purely for the purpose of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Given that only 30% of these will ultimately prove to be malignant on surgical pathology, the majority of these lobectomies could potentially be avoided if better non-invasive methods existed to evaluate indeterminate nodules. Electrical Impedance Scanning (EIS) has been previously investigated for non-invasive evaluation of thyroid nodules. The overall diagnostic accuracy of EIS was encouraging but not sufficient for routine clinical use. We have developed a modified approach termed here Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) that should have substantially higher sensitivity and specificity for this very purpose. When using REIS technology to examine the breast, we obtained initial results that are significantly better in all respects than those obtained with traditional EIS. We believe that REIS technology will similarly improve the assessment of thyroid nodules. REIS hold promise as a reproducible modality for the risk stratification of the many patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules. It is a new non- invasive modality that may help reduce the number of diagnostic lobectomies and would be welcomed by patients with non-diagnostic FNA results. The purpose of this application is to design, assemble, and test in a preliminary clinical study a unique REIS based device for the assessment of thyroid nodules.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules. We will assess the ability of this technology to accurately characterize these indeterminate nodules as benign or malignant prior to a ""diagnostic"" surgery.           We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules.

"Automatic Acquisition of Knowledge for Senior Care Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dramatic growth of the senior population in the U.S. is widely expected to challenge the capacity of this segment of the U.S. health system. Alternative strategies to support seniors living independently will be critical in meeting the short fall. My Health Care Manager (MHCM) has developed the Senior Care Navigation System (SCANSTM) to provide decision support to Geriatric Care Managers (GCMs), registered nurses and social workers, in the construction of consumer-side care plans for seniors and their caregivers. SCANSTM provides interventions and practical, real-world tools to extend the healthy and active years of life and assist families with critical decisions. Automatic acquisition of knowledge will help to augment MHCM's research staff in order to keep the SCANSTM knowledge base up to date for providing effective and efficient senior care plans. The overall goal for this Fast-Track SBIR research will be for MHCM in collaboration with the Indiana University's School of Informatics to develop an automated knowledge acquisition system that will acquire knowledge from health literature pertinent to senior care. This knowledge in the form of ""best practices"" will be used as part of the SCANSTM decision support system. The automatic acquisition of knowledge will greatly increase the overall productivity of the SCANS Research Team. The improvements in quality, timeliness, breadth, depth, and volume of research will be a marketable feature of the SCANSTM product. During Phase I, MHCM will validate the feasibility of automatically acquiring knowledge in literature for senior care planning. MHCM will develop knowledge extraction methodologies for geriatric care in Phase I and will implement 3 of 40 MHCM defined care categories. Phase II will expand on the algorithm(s) developed during Phase I to include an additional 30-37 care categories. MCHM will also develop geriatric care intervention discovery algorithms to be used in finding, updating, and evaluating new knowledge to be included in the SCANSTM knowledgebase. MHCM will verify and validate the feasibility of the knowledge acquisition methods by comparing the current manual research process with an automated acquisition process using literature. MHCM will then augment the knowledge discovered through text mining with an existing Bayesian Reasoning Network model to make the SCANS TM an efficient decision support system for geriatric care. With the completion of Phases I and II, commercialization of the knowledge acquisition system for SCANSTM can then proceed in Phase III of the project.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this Fast-Track research application is to improve the quality, depth and breadth of research reference material held in the Senior Care Navigation System, SCANS, knowledgebase used by our Geriatric Care Managers. The knowledgebase helps our GCM's to prepare comprehensive care plans for elders and their care givers covering 40 care categories.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests).

"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,8136907,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2011,247887,0.013777879165244996
"Guideline-based surveillance and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest rising cause of cancer-related deaths. Survival following diagnosis with HCC is poor unless it is detected early and stage-appropriate treatment is applied. Clinical practice guidelines outline recommendations for HCC surveillance and treatment of HCC. No study has examined the implementation or outcomes of guideline-based HCC surveillance in high risk patients or stage- appropriate treatment in patients who develop HCC. OBJECTIVES: Using data obtained from VA administrative databases combined with information abstracted from national VA electronic medical records using the VA Compensation and Pension Record Interchange application, we propose to address the following Aims: 1) to examine the implementation of guideline-based HCC surveillance in a national sample of patients with cirrhosis, and to examine patient, physician and facility factors associated with appropriate or inappropriate implementation of surveillance; 2) to evaluate the implementation of guideline-based stage-appropriate treatment among patients with HCC, and to examine patient, physician, and facility factors associated with receipt of stage-appropriate treatment; and 3) to examine the effect of guideline-based HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment on survival. METHODS: We propose a retrospective cohort study using two stratified random samples of approximately 1,500 patients with cirrhosis and 1,500 patients with HCC diagnosed during 2006-2009 in VA facilities nationwide. For Aim 1, the outcome will be appropriate (guideline-based surveillance, receipt of an imaging test unrelated to HCC surveillance, no surveillance) versus inappropriate (non-guideline based surveillance, overutilization of surveillance) implementation of HCC surveillance among patients with one of the four primary etiologies for cirrhosis (hepatitis C, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis B, alcoholic liver disease). Patient, physician, and facility factors associated with appropriate implementation of HCC surveillance will be examined using logistic regression. For Aim 2, the outcome will be receipt of stage-appropriate HCC treatment versus stage-inappropriate treatment or no treatment among patients with HCC. Each patient will be assigned to a stage-appropriate treatment category according to current guidelines, which will be compared against the treatment received. Logistic regression will be used to examine predictors of receiving stage-appropriate treatment. For Aim 3, the outcome will be survival among patients with cirrhosis who developed HCC. Receipt of appropriate HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment will be the primary predictors of interest. Marginal structural modeling will be used to examine these associations.

"Medication Intervention in Transitional Care to Optimize CKD Outcomes & Costs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary Transitional care interventions reduce hospital readmissions and slow the progression of declining health in the general population of hospitalized patients. What is not known is the impact transitional care interventions can have for the hospitalized CKD population. CKD patients are in critical need of improved transitional care that includes accurate and comprehensive medication information transfer. The main objective of this application is to pilot-test the effectiveness of a medication information transfer intervention to improve clinically-relevant outcomes in CKD. To this end, the following Specific Aims will be achieved: 1. Evaluate the impact of transitional care interventions on acute care utilization following hospital discharge among patients with CKD. 2. Evaluate the impact of transitional care strategies on management of CKD risk factors and complications. Focus groups will first be conducted to assure relevance and to refine the intervention. A qualitative research design with convenience sampling will be used to survey recently hospitalized CKD patients (n~10) and their healthcare professionals (n~10). The medication information transfer intervention will be evaluated in a pilot study using a randomized, single-blind clinical trial design. Participants and the pharmacist interventionist will have knowledge of group assignment, but the other investigators and research staff will be blinded. Study entry criteria will include hospitalized patients >21 years old (n=120) who have a diagnosis of CKD stages 3-5 (not including those treated by dialysis or kidney transplant). After obtaining IRB-approved written informed consent, patients will be randomized by computer algorithm for group assignment, stratifying according to diabetes status. The pharmacist will visit participants in the home within 5 days of hospital discharge. The 5As (Assessment, Advice, Agreement, Assistance, and Arrangements) Self-Management Model will be used to implement the medication information transfer intervention. Clinical assessments will be performed at baseline and at 30 and 90 days. Primary outcome measures for Specific Aim 1 will be acute care utilization (emergency department visits and hospitalizations). The main outcomes for Specific Aim 2 will be measures of CKD risk factors and complications. Blood pressure will be the primary outcome for this aim because hypertension control is the most consistent recommendation for slowing CKD progression. Logistic regression analyses will be employed controlling for age, sex, CKD stage, co- morbidities, Charleson score, cognitive status, medication adherence and health literacy. Cost will be analyzed based on charges from hospitalization through the following 90 days using a difference-of- difference approach. This contribution is significant because it will define methods to overcome system barriers that result in impaired quality and continuity of care. The proposed research is innovative because it integrates established clinical strategies with systems approaches to improve patient care, thereby testing a fundamentally new approach to advance CKD management.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project narrative the proposed research is relevant to public health because it will positively impact a common, deadly, and costly chronic disease - CKD - by reducing acute care utilization and costs as well as by improving outpatient management. This medication information transfer intervention in the transitional care of hospitalized CKD patients will have wide-appeal for adoption by healthcare systems and for other chronic illnesses. The project supports the mission of NIDDK by translating lessons learned from clinical research in CKD into improved clinical outcomes that can be readily measured and anticipated in practice.              Project narrative the proposed research is relevant to public health because it will positively impact a common, deadly, and costly chronic disease - CKD - by reducing acute care utilization and costs as well as by improving outpatient management.

"Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health-care acquired pneumonia (HCAP) is a newly-recognized clinical entity which has a higher morbidity and mortality than community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Patients with HCAP are at risk for multi-drug resistant organisms due to past healthcare exposures such as recent hospitalizations, nursing homes, and dialysis units, and tend to have a high burden of co-morbid illnesses. The 2005 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend that patients diagnosed with HCAP be treated initially with 3 broad- spectrum antibiotics; however, the evidence behind these recommendations comes from several small observational trials. These studies show that compared to patients with CAP, patients with HCAP have higher mortality and are more likely to be treated with inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy, but it is not known whether widespread use of several broad-spectrum agents will improve patient outcomes. Because these antibiotics can cause serious side effects and are often expensive, physicians may be hesitant to prescribe according to the guidelines without more evidence of their comparative effectiveness. We will conduct a retrospective cohort study using highly detailed patient-level claims and microbiological data contained in the Perspective data warehouse (PREMIER Healthcare Inc.) from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 from 550 participating hospitals in the United States. We will examine data from hospitalized patients  = 18 years of age who were admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia. The aim of our study is to determine whether patients hospitalized for HCAP have worse outcomes than those admitted for CAP, whether differences in outcome are due to co-morbid illnesses or to resistant organisms, and whether HCAP patients who are treated with the empiric antibiotic regimen recommended by the ATS-IDSA guidelines have better outcomes (lower mortality, fewer complications, shorter length-of stay and lower costs) than patients treated with other antibiotics. Our study will use sophisticated statistical methods, including logistic regression, propensity matching and an adaptation of the instrumental variable approach, to adjust for pre- treatment differences between patients and compare the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens. Our results will help to guide physicians in the treatment of individual patients and aid experts in developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Information we discover about physician practice patterns will also help quality officers and policy-makers identify areas for improvement in the care of this common and deadly illness.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia"" will provide important insight into a clinical dilemma faced by physicians who care for as many as 300,000 patients each year with Healthcare-Associated pneumonia (HCAP). This study will assess whether patients with HCAP are receiving care consistent with the recommendations found in guidelines developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America, and whether those treated according to the guidelines have better outcomes than patients who are treated with other antibiotics. These results will help clinicians balance the potential benefits of the recommended antibiotics against the potential harms of antibiotic side effects, future antibiotic resistance, and increased costs. If recommended therapy is beneficial but underutilized, these results will alert quality improvement officers and policy makers to an important opportunity to improve patient care for a common and deadly illness.           Project Narrative ""Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia"" will provide important insight into a clinical dilemma faced by physicians who care for as many as 300,000 patients each year with Healthcare-Associated pneumonia (HCAP).

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.    The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.    We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.    If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecasts that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit.

"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.                   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly.

"Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persons with a primary malignant brain tumor (PMBT) often suffer significant functional and neurologic morbidity causing family caregivers to assume the care recipient's familial, social, and financial obligations. Research has shown that caregivers of persons with other chronic diseases develop negative consequences as a result of providing care. Despite high morbidity (and mortality) rates for persons with a PMBT, caregiver issues in neuro-oncology have been virtually ignored. In response to PA-05-027, the purposes of this study are to use a multidisciplinary, integrative model, the Pittsburgh Mind Body Center Model, to (1) examine the psycho-behavioral responses (i.e. depressive symptoms and sleep), biologic responses (i.e. blood pressure and ihterleukins) and overall physical health of family members of persons with a PMBT at the time of diagnosis, and (2) to describe how relationships within the model vary over time in response to changes in the care recipient's illness trajectory as the family member transitions to a family caregiver. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) examine how care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho- behavioral responses, biologic responses, and overall physical health change over time (from PBMT diagnosis to 12 months after diagnosis); and during this 12-month period, to 2) examine how caregivers' personal characteristics moderate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho-behavioral responses; 3) examine how caregiver psycho-behavioral responses mediate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' biologic responses; and 4) examine how caregivers' biologic responses mediate the relationship between their psycho-behavioral responses and overall physical health. A descriptive longitudinal design will be used to collect data to address the aims of the project. Linear and logistic regression analysis will be used to model baseline responses. Repeated measures analysis (random coefficients modeling) will be used to examine change over time and latent growth curve modeling will be used to further explore longitudinal data. The relevance of the project to public health is to identify caregivers at specific time-points during the care recipient's disease trajectory who are vulnerable to changes in their emotional and physical health. Improving caregivers' emotional and physical health may improve the delivery of care and quality of life for the care recipient.           n/a",Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers,8118960,R01CA118711,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Endocrine', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Face', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Functional disorder', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Rate', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Institutionalization', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Obligations', 'Stress', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'body-mind', 'burnout', 'care delivery', 'depressive symptoms', 'disease characteristic', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'longitudinal design', 'loved ones', 'meetings', 'mind body interaction', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'social']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2011,376447,0.009425789000274623
"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response.

"Screening and Brief Intervention in the ED among Mexican-origin Young Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening and Brief Intervention in the ED among Mexican-origin Young Adults The aims of this application ""Screening and Brief Alcohol Intervention in Underage and Young Adult Populations"" are to: 1) examine the effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) among Mexican-origin young adults (age 18-25), using a motivational intervention delivered by a Health Promotion Advocate (promotore), relative to standard care with and without assessment, on a reduction in heavy drinking (drinking days per week, number of drinks per day, maximum number of drinks on an occasion) and alcohol-related problems (RAPS4 and SIPS +6) in the emergency department (ED) at the U.S.- Mexico border; and, 2) identify variables that are related to effectiveness of the intervention and that predict successful treatment outcome. We plan to translate motivational interventions that have been successful in primary care and which were recently implemented in the U.S. 14 Academic Emergency Medicine Collaborative (AEMC) SBIRT study to a population of young adult Mexican-origin ED patients on the Texas border in El Paso; a population which has evidenced a high prevalence of hazardous drinking and alcohol- related problems, in part due to the greater availability of alcohol and at low cost in Mexico border cities. The SBIRT study, funded by NIAAA and SAAMHSA, was the first multi-site, collaborative study of screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED. We will conduct a blinded randomized control brief motivational intervention trial in which both injured and non-injured patients will be screened for at- risk or dependent (using the RAPS4) drinking. Patients screening positive who consent to participate in the study will be randomized into one of three groups: screened only, assessed, and assessed plus brief intervention, with n=312 in each group. Intervention and assessment groups will be followed-up at 3 months and all three groups at 12 months. Modifying variables include drinking in the event, risk-taking disposition, readiness and stage of change, country of birth (U.S. vs. Mexico) and language in which the assessment and intervention were conducted (English vs. Spanish). Outcome data will be analyzed using ANOVA, logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations. The interaction of modifying variables on outcomes will also be analyzed. Additionally, the study will examine data relevant to key issues related to the potential translatability and public health impact of the intervention and next steps. Given the paucity of published studies of brief intervention in the ED among young adults in general, or among Mexican-origin adults, and none among Mexican-origin young adults, who may be most vulnerable to alcohol use problems and disorders, especially at the border, work to be undertaken in this application is especially important in determining the effectiveness of AEMC SBIRT protocols (which may serve as a prototype for screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED) in this context of Mexican-origin young adults.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work is especially relevant to public health in relation to reducing subsequent alcohol-related ED visits and associated costs and increase quality of life among young adults. The project will inform the development and spread of more effective techniques and protocols for addressing at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED in this age group, and provide a better understanding of those factors that influence effectiveness of brief intervention and predict successful patient outcomes across ethnic and cultural groups in the U.S. Additionally, this will be the first randomized controlled clinical trial compared to standard care of brief intervention using promotores in the Mexican-origin community, which may provide a better chance of ongoing implementation of SBIRT in the ED than using ED staff providers.             Relevance Statement  This work is especially relevant to public health in relation to reducing subsequent alcohol-related ED visits and  associated costs and increase quality of life among young adults.

"FT-IR Microscopy of Mineral Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is responsible for approximately 1.5 million fractures in the US per year, with 300,000 of these fractures occurring at the hip at a cost exceeding $17 billion. The NIH Consensus conference and the World Health Organization defined osteoporosis as ""...compromised bone strength predisposing to an increased risk of fracture"". A variety of genetic and environmental factors, as well as bone properties (geometric and material), contribute to the bone loss that is associated with osteoporosis, but the question remains as to which factors primarily contribute to fracture risk. While reduced bone mineral density (BMD) relative to young individuals is routinely used clinically to predict fracture risk, BMD is not a strong predictor, with the majority of fractures occurring in patients with BMD's above the osteoporotic threshold. We have recently shown by multiple logistic regression analysis that specific mineral and matrix properties assessed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging (FTIRI) are predictive of fracture in postmenopausal women, while BMD is not significantly associated with fracture incidence. In a limited number of samples we have also shown that these FTIR parameters are correlated with nanomechanical properties. We hypothesize that variation in crystallinity (XST) and collagen maturity (XLR) partially explains the difference in incidence of fractures in individuals with similar BMDs. We further hypothesize that heterogeneity in these parameters is an additional determinant of fracture incidence, especially in trabecular bone. In the proposed studies we will test 4 hypotheses. 1) For any subject, FTIRI data obtained in the cortical and cancellous bone of the iliac crest (generally a non-fracturing site) is representative of that from sites that fracture (subtrochanter/greater trochanter). Further, the data are independent of the size of the biopsy as long as cortical and cancellous bone areas are included. This will be tested using multiple biopsies from cadavers and from clinic patients with fractures. Measures will include micro-CT analysis of BMD and architecture, and FTIRI. 2) Decreased heterogeneity in FTIRI mineral and matrix properties, in addition to increased XST and XLR, are predictive of fracture in humans. This will be tested by extending our logistic regression to heterogeneity parameters. Variation in tissue properties with age will be studied in patients with idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. Tissue mechanical properties will be correlated with FTIRI data. 3) An anabolic agent (PTH) can restore mechanical properties, and the XST, XLR, and mineral and matrix heterogeneity in animal models as well as in osteoporotic humans. This will be tested by analyses of pre- and post- treatment human biopsies and by analyses in a sheep model. 4) XLR, which is altered in osteoporosis, is related to collagen orientation. As part of our continued parameter validation, this will be tested by comparing FTIRI and second harmonic heneration microscopy data. Testing of these four hypotheses will provide new insights into the efficacy of therapies and contribute to the understanding of factors leading to fracture.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this continuing investigation is to discover what changes in bone properties cause a bone in a person with osteoporosis to break; we have suggestive evidence that changes in the structure and composition of the bone composite (mineral and matrix) put bones at risk of breaking during normal activities of daily life. Correlations are sought between spatial variation in parameters obtained by vibrational spectroscopy and mechanical properties. This information should lead to improved diagnosis and new approaches to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, the ""silent epidemic"".              The objective of this continuing investigation is to discover what changes in bone properties cause a bone in a person with osteoporosis to break; we have suggestive evidence that changes in the structure and composition of the bone composite (mineral and matrix) put bones at risk of breaking during normal activities of daily life.

"Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in hospital electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring technology, monitoring practices are inconsistent and often inadequate. We recently published new practice standards for ECG monitoring. The primary purpose of our proposed 5-year multisite randomized clinical trial, which is guided by the knowledge transfer framework, is to test the effect of implementing these standards on nurses' knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. We will also explore the sustainability of effects in the experimental group and the effect of the delayed intervention in the control group. We expect that increased knowledge and skills of nurses will lead to enhanced quality of care, which will result in improved outcomes for patients. Units serving cardiac patients in 16 hospitals will participate. Hospitals will be randomized to the experimental or control group after baseline measures of knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes are obtained. The intervention will include ECG monitoring education and strategies to implement and sustain change. The education will be Web-based and include 4 modules: essentials of ECG monitoring, arrhythmia monitoring, ischemia monitoring, and QT interval monitoring. The standardization of content, flexibility of use, immediate feedback in both practice and testing sections are advantages of Web-based education. The use of simulations to test skills makes our program innovative. The strategies to implement and sustain change in the clinical area include reinforcement of education, incentives, and the designation of  champions  on each unit who will actively promote the implementation of the practice standards. Statistical analyses will account for intra-cluster correlation at the hospital level. Most outcomes are categorical with 2 levels, whereas knowledge and skill scores are continuous. For categorical outcomes, two approaches will be considered: logistic regression models complemented with intra-cluster correlation using generalized estimating equations methods and extended Mantel-Haenszel cross-tabulation methods stratifying by cluster. For continuous outcomes, mixed modeling will be used to account for intra-cluster correlation through hierarchical linear models. We developed the new practice standards to improve hospital ECG monitoring. We expect that improved ECG monitoring will result in more accurate diagnosis and more timely treatment, which will lead to better outcomes for patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to test the effect of implementing new practice standards for electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring on nurses  knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. If implementation of the practice standards is associated with improvement in quality of care and patient outcomes, then there is the potential for improved care and outcomes for the literally millions of patients who require continuous ECG monitoring while hospitalized.          n/a",Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring,8060632,R01HL081642,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardioscopes', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Units', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Simulate', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular nursing', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'flexibility', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nursing skill', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,749307,0.021734089468340562

"Cigarette Smoking among Head and Neck Cancer Patients: A Prospective Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Behavioral research with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients is high priority. The etiology of HNSCC is linked to the health risk behaviors of tobacco and alcohol consumption. At diagnosis, prevalence rates for cigarette smoking and alcohol use have been estimated to be above 80% and 65%, respectively. Among patients who report cigarette smoking in the year preceding diagnosis, about one-third continue to smoke following completion of cancer treatment. So while HNSCC diagnosis may be considered a ""teachable moment,"" in which motivation for health behavior change is theorized to be high, not all patients regard HNSCC diagnosis as a sufficient catalyst for cigarette smoking cessation. Notably, this is despite the fact that continued cigarette smoking is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including poorer treatment response and higher risk for recurrence. Researchers have made attempts to identify variables associated with cigarette smoking after HNSCC diagnosis, but the current literature is limited. The overall objective of the proposed project is to increase understanding of factors facilitating and impeding smoking cessation among patients recently diagnosed with HNSCC. Specific aims: (1) To characterize the trajectory of cigarette smoking from the time of HNSCC diagnosis to 6 months following initiation of cancer treatment, (2) To assess the utility of Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) for understanding changes in HNSCC patients' cigarette smoking, and (3) To assess the independent contribution of depressive symptoms and concurrent alcohol use for understanding changes in HNSCC patients' cigarette smoking. The above aims will be achieved using a prospective, longitudinal design in which 120 HNSCC patients are assessed before treatment initiation and then 2 and 6 months after treatment initiation. Males and females will be included in the study and the demographic characteristics of participants are expected to reflect the population of Kentucky. At each assessment, data will be collected via telephone interview. Study hypotheses will be tested using McNemar tests of paired comparisons, binomial logistic regression, and linear multiple regression analyses. Study results have the potential to highlight the importance of integrating discussions of behavior change into the course of cancer treatment, and may inform health personnel and behavioral science researchers of significant risk factors for cigarette smoking following HNSCC diagnosis. Results of the project may also be helpful in developing more efficacious smoking cessation interventions for HNSCC patients.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Overall, the proposed research is important because of its emphasis on understanding factors related to the reduction health risk behaviors, and associated improvement in clinical outcomes.           n/a",Cigarette Smoking among Head and Neck Cancer Patients: A Prospective Study,7940859,F31CA139956,"['Aftercare', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Female', 'Future', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Kentucky', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mental Health', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Paired Comparison', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Planning Theory', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoke', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'behavior change', 'cancer therapy', 'catalyst', 'cigarette smoking', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'high risk', 'longitudinal design', 'male', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'smoking cessation', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,F31,2010,39783,-0.036617603039383974
"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,8110751,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic Diseases', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Running', 'Rural Community', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'high risk', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2010,50000,0.006245088590132478
"Claims-based surveillance of surgical site infections following vascular surgery.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop and validate a standardized, claims-based surveillance method to rank hospitals nationally based on diagnosis and procedure codes suggestive of surgical site infection (SSI) following vascular surgery. This work will be part of an ongoing collaboration between the Harvard-based CDC Prevention Epicenter, the CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The first aim is to develop a set of diagnosis and procedure codes that suggest SSI following vascular surgery. We will perform a retrospective cohort study of Medicare patients who underwent one of the vascular procedures targeted by the national Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) in 2005. Approximately 100 codes that have been pre-selected as SSI indicators will be pilot tested in five CDC Prevention Epicenter hospitals using full medical record review. We will use the pilot test to refine our code list to ensure a sensitivity of at least 90% for all confirmed SSIs while attempting to maximize specificity. The second aim is to apply our refined claims-based surveillance method to the 2005-2008 Medicare national claims database. We will rank all hospitals that performed at least 200 targeted vascular procedures in Medicare patients between 2005 and 2008 (average of 50 procedures per year). Ranking will be based on the fraction of patients at each individual hospital with>1 SSI indicator according to the claims-based surveillance method. Rankings will adjust for age, gender, and Romano comorbidity score via a generalized linear mixed model that controls for clustering within institutions. Hospitals will be grouped into deciles based on their adjusted SSI rates. Finally, the third aim is to validate the ranking of hospitals in the best and worst deciles based upon nationwide review of up to 1,500 full-text records. We will perform logistic regression to assess the relationship between having a vascular surgery performed in a best versus worst deciles hospital while controlling for case mix.           Project Narrative  This partnership with CMS and CDC will enhance the national effort to identify hospitals with potentially elevated surgical site infection rates following high volume procedures. We seek to develop a standardized and less resource intensive system that will allow routine identification of hospitals with unusually high rates of these complications.

"Access to Liver Transplantation for Patients with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic liver disease that has no treatment and is an otherwise fatal disease without liver transplantation. Patients with PSC face unique complications as compared to other patients with end-stage liver disease, including cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), cholangitis from biliary strictures, and complications such as colon cancer from concomitant inflammatory bowel disease. The current model for allocation of livers, instituted on February 27th, 2002, relies on a patient's Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, which accounts for a patient's serum INR, creatinine, and bilirubin. The MELD score places more weight on the INR and creatinine, although in patients with PSC the bilirubin is disproportionately elevated. This fact, along with the fact that complications such as CCA are not captured by the MELD data elements, leads us to believe that the MELD score may place patients with PSC at a survival disadvantage. If this is true, then this may serve as a basis for a policy change in how livers are allocated. For patients with PSC on the waitlist, their risk of death may be higher for two reasons. Either the risk of death for a given MELD score is higher for patients with PSC, or in patients with PSC, the MELD score rises more slowly, making patients less likely to receive a transplant and thereby exposed for a longer duration to the risks of clinical deterioration and removal from the waitlist. Our first aim will address this primary research question in three ways. We will develop two Cox proportional hazard models, one accounting for all of a patient's MELD scores while on the waitlist, and another adjusting only for MELD at listing. We will also perform logistic regression to evaluate the clinically important outcome of death vs. transplant. Our second aim will serve to determine the frequencies with which potential liver transplant recipients are removed from the waitlist due to clinical deterioration among those in whom the reasons for withdrawal are unspecified in UNOS data. By collecting patient level data from individual transplant centers, we will be able to calculate the extent of this outcome misclassification and thereby guide quantitative sensitivity analyses of our primary models in Aim I. Lastly, we will evaluate whether introduction of the MELD system for liver allocation was associated with changes in rates of living donor liver transplantation among patients with PSC relative to corresponding rates among patients without PSC. This analysis is needed as differential rates of referral for living donor transplant among patients with and without PSC could affect the extent to which diagnosis may influence the outcomes in Aim I. The proposed research project will be in the context of the applicant working towards a Masters of Science in Clinical Epidemiology, whereby didactic learning in the classroom, focusing on fundamentals of epidemiology, study design, and statistical and analytic methods of research will enhance and guide the research process of the applicant. The long-term objectives of the applicant for this project are to collect and analyze the data, prepare manuscripts for publication, and build upon the data as part of a future application for a K award.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The allocation of organs for liver transplantation has major public health implications in that decisions must be made as to how we allocate a scarce resource.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,7821454,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic Diseases', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Running', 'Rural Community', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'high risk', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2010,100455,0.006245088590132478
"An Automatic Notification System for Test Results Finalized after Discharge    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract: The transition to the ambulatory setting following hospital discharge is a vulnerable time for patients.  One important patient safety concern is failure of responsible providers to reliably follow up test results finalized after a patient is discharged. Such failure can lead to delays in diagnosis, missed treatment opportunities, redundant ordering of tests, and subsequent patient harm. Automated systems that ensure timely notification of these test results to responsible providers have the potential to mitigate these well documented problems and improve health care quality and safety. The goals of this project are to create an information technology-based automatic notification system to prompt responsible physicians of test results finalized after discharge and to evaluate the impact of this system on physician awareness of these test results. In the first phase of this study, the components of the system will be designed. These include 1) a query of all tests whose final results are pending at the time of discharge, 2) a query for the identity and email   addresses of the patient's responsible inpatient and ambulatory provider, 3) logic to exclude routinely ordered inpatient tests to avoid provider alert fatigue, 4) automatic email notification of finalized test results to responsible providers once they are available, and 5) documentation of these results in the ambulatory electronic medical record. The system is designed to facilitate timely communication and the creation of a collaborative plan of care among inpatient and outpatient providers during a patient's transition to the ambulatory setting. A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted to measure the impact of such a system on physician awareness. To minimize contamination, both inpatient and ambulatory providers will be randomized, and patients will only be enrolled if both responsible physicians are in the same arm of the study. Study subjects will include patients discharged from the inpatient general medicine and cardiology services at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The primary outcome will be awareness of all post-discharge test results among responsible providers. Secondary outcomes will include user satisfaction, awareness of actionable test results (as judged by providers), and whether appropriate actions are subsequently taken in response to these results (based on electronic medical record review). Physician awareness will be determined using an email survey to providers 72 hours after the first finalized test result is available. The primary outcome will be analyzed as the proportion of test results per patient of which a provider is aware using binomial logistic   regression. General estimating equations will be used to adjust for patient and physician characteristics and to cluster by physician. Over a six-month study period, 450 patients will be enrolled in order to provide adequate power to detect an improvement in awareness from 40% to 60% of results. The results of this study will inform future efforts to optimize this type of intervention both at BWH and at other institutions trying to solve this important patient safety problem.           Project Narrative: Physicians are often unaware of test results that return after a patient leaves the hospital, a problem which could lead to delays in diagnosis, missed treatment opportunities, unnecessary ordering of additional tests, and patient harm. The goal of this project is to develop an automatic notification system to ensure that a patient's physicians receive test results that are finalized after hospital discharge. We plan to study whether this system improves physicians' awareness of these test results and then share our findings so that other health care systems can learn from our experiences.",An Automatic Notification System for Test Results Finalized after Discharge,7935467,R21HS018229,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2010,114789,0.013342145815283259
"Early Acute Lung Injury: Prospective Evaluation Prior to Respiratory Failure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary and non-pulmonary insults and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite two decades of targeted investigation by the NHLBI, little is known about ALI prior to progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Accordingly, the aims of this research plan are to: 1) prospectively identify independent predictors of progression to ALI requiring mechanical ventilation and establish a clinical definition of early ALI; 2) evaluate the pathogenetic role of biologic markers of inflammation and lung injury and their value for refining risk stratification of patients at risk for progression to ALI, and 3) test the potential therapeutic value of an aerosolized beta-2 agonist in patients with early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 1 will identify cases of potential early ALI by screening chest radiographs of all adult emergency department and medicine service admissions. Patients admitted to the hospital with bilateral opacities on chest radiograph not due to isolated left atrial hypertension will be followed for progression to ALI during their hospitalization. Clinical characteristics (demographics, diagnoses, comorbidities, vital signs, and Borg dyspnea scores) will be recorded for the first 72 hours of admission. Independent predictors of progression to ALI will be determined by multivariate logistic regression and incorporated into a clinical definition of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 2, plasma levels of biomarkers (IL-8, sTNFr-1, vWF, ICAM-1, SP-D and RAGE) representing distinct pathways contributing to acute lung injury will be measured at time 0 and 24 hours after study enrollment. Biomarkers will be analyzed by multivariate regression analysis to assess their value for stratifying patients at risk for progression to ALI and provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 3 I will conduct a randomized clinical trial of aerosoUzed albuterol vs. placebo in patients with early ALI. The primary endpoint will be the Pa02 / Fi02 on day 4 of treatment. Secondary outcome measures will be rate of progression to ALI and change in plasma biologic marker levels. This will be a first-of-its-kind trial to establish that patients with early ALI can be identified and treatment can be initiated prior to need for mechanical ventilation. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Following the paradigm of early goal-directed therapy for severe sepsis, clinical benefit may derive from identifying patients with early ALI and initiating treatment prior to the need for mechanical ventilation (and therefore prior to meeting current study entry criteria). Establishing evidence based clinical definition of early ALI will facilitate identification and risk stratification of subjects for enrollment in future clinical trials.

"Automatic Acquisition of Knowledge for Senior Care Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dramatic growth of the senior population in the U.S. is widely expected to challenge the capacity of this segment of the U.S. health system. Alternative strategies to support seniors living independently will be critical in meeting the short fall. My Health Care Manager (MHCM) has developed the Senior Care Navigation System (SCANSTM) to provide decision support to Geriatric Care Managers (GCMs), registered nurses and social workers, in the construction of consumer-side care plans for seniors and their caregivers. SCANSTM provides interventions and practical, real-world tools to extend the healthy and active years of life and assist families with critical decisions. Automatic acquisition of knowledge will help to augment MHCM's research staff in order to keep the SCANSTM knowledge base up to date for providing effective and efficient senior care plans. The overall goal for this Fast-Track SBIR research will be for MHCM in collaboration with the Indiana University's School of Informatics to develop an automated knowledge acquisition system that will acquire knowledge from health literature pertinent to senior care. This knowledge in the form of ""best practices"" will be used as part of the SCANSTM decision support system. The automatic acquisition of knowledge will greatly increase the overall productivity of the SCANS Research Team. The improvements in quality, timeliness, breadth, depth, and volume of research will be a marketable feature of the SCANSTM product. During Phase I, MHCM will validate the feasibility of automatically acquiring knowledge in literature for senior care planning. MHCM will develop knowledge extraction methodologies for geriatric care in Phase I and will implement 3 of 40 MHCM defined care categories. Phase II will expand on the algorithm(s) developed during Phase I to include an additional 30-37 care categories. MCHM will also develop geriatric care intervention discovery algorithms to be used in finding, updating, and evaluating new knowledge to be included in the SCANSTM knowledgebase. MHCM will verify and validate the feasibility of the knowledge acquisition methods by comparing the current manual research process with an automated acquisition process using literature. MHCM will then augment the knowledge discovered through text mining with an existing Bayesian Reasoning Network model to make the SCANS TM an efficient decision support system for geriatric care. With the completion of Phases I and II, commercialization of the knowledge acquisition system for SCANSTM can then proceed in Phase III of the project.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this Fast-Track research application is to improve the quality, depth and breadth of research reference material held in the Senior Care Navigation System, SCANS, knowledgebase used by our Geriatric Care Managers. The knowledgebase helps our GCM's to prepare comprehensive care plans for elders and their care givers covering 40 care categories. The intent is to expand the knowledge of and coordinate the services available to seniors and their families for improving their quality of life and for extending independent living.           My Health Care Manager Inc.

"Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award proposal describes the 5-year training program for Dr. Elliott R. Haut. The proposal builds upon the candidate's strengths and prior research skills, while utilizing the unique opportunities of The Johns Hopkins University. The mentorship of Dr. Peter Pronovost and formal advanced degree coursework in the Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation (GTPCI), will give Dr. Haut the tools and training to advance to the level of a fully independent health services researcher. Pay for performance and public reporting of quality are growing exponentially in medicine. Implicit in these systems is the assumed presence of a valid way to measure clinical quality. Many national agencies (AHRQ, NQF) have suggested deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence as a metric of health care quality. DVT is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, yet may be completely asymptomatic until the clot embolizes and causes sudden death from massive pulmonary embolism. Duplex ultrasound serves an important role as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DVT detection. However, screening asymptomatic trauma patients for DVT is controversial, these practices likely vary widely among hospitals, and no national agency has recommended a standardized screening approach. In the absence of standardized surveillance, DVT rates may be influenced more by how often caregivers look for these events rather than the quality of care provided. This is a classic example of surveillance bias in which event rates identified and reported may merely reflect levels of vigilance. Higher DVT rates may not be a marker of poor quality of care, but rather an outcome of more aggressive screening practices. Providers who look harder by ordering more screening duplex ultrasounds, may report higher rates of DVT, and appear to provide poorer quality of care than those providers who do not screen. Therefore, DVT rates reported may be unreliable measures of quality of care and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives. SA#1 will examine the impact of hospital-level ultrasound rates on DVT rates reported after major trauma. SA#2 will determine whether hospital duplex and DVT rates correlate with the presence of a hospital duplex ultrasound screening protocol for high-risk trauma patients. SA#3 will determine if patients are more likely to have DVT diagnosed and reported based on hospital characteristics, controlling for patient-level DVT risk factors using multi-level multiple logistic regression. Some hospitals use duplex ultrasound to screen asymptomatic trauma patients for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while other hospitals do not. Hospitals that screen trauma patients may identify and report higher DVT rates merely because they search for DVTs more aggressively. Therefore, reported DVT rates are unreliable quality of care measures and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives.             n/a",Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?,7882499,K08HS017952,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K08,2010,154821,0.005117968571602528
"Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders Dr. Deborah Ann Hall is applying for a mentored patient-oriented research (K23) award in the area of movement disorders. This proposal describes a research and training program for the development of a clinician-investigator in neurology. The principal investigator, Dr. Hall, has completed neurology residency  raining and a movement disorders fellowship. She received a competitive clinical research fellowship from the American Academy of Neurology and is pursuing a Ph.D. in Clinical Science. The candidate's immediate goals are to continue research in the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, by directly applying her newly acquired epidemiologic and biostatistics skills in the proposed project. Her long term goals are to study the genetic risk factors, neuroepidemiology, and treatment of ataxia, including sporadic ataxia. During the award period, Dr. Hall will be based in the Department of Neurology at the University of Colorado (UCDHSC). UCDHSC has an extensive track record for supporting and developing clinician-investigators. The Ph.D. in Clinical Sciences program at UCDHSC facilitates mentored multidisciplinary clinical research. The candidate will carry out her research with Professors Tim Byers MD (Epidemiology), Maureen Leehey MD (Neurology), Gary Zerbe PhD (Biostatistics), and Paul Hagerman MD PhD (Biological Chemistry). Dr. Hall's research program is to determine the prevalence of repeat expansions in the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation) gene in subjects with tremor, ataxia, and/or parkinsonism. Dr. Hall will do a cross- sectional study by recruiting subjects in her clinics with the three phenotypes and performing PCR of the FMR1 gene. All subjects eligible will be recruited and the genetic testing will be done in a research laboratory. The primary outcomes to be measured are the prevalence of repeat expansions in the three groups combined and each phenotypic subgroup. The age of onset, age of diagnosis of neurological signs, and correlations between trinucleotide repeat size and phenotype are also outcomes to be measured. Linear and logistic regression models will be used and covariates including race and ethnicity will be studied. Relevance: This study is important because it may define genetic risk factors for various abnormal movements, such as tremor. This will result in improved diagnosis and potentially treatment of individuals with progressive neurological diseases. These illnesses represent an important public health problem as they cause morbidity and mortality in our aging population. n/a",Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders,7804478,K23NS052487,"['Academy', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Award', 'Biochemistry', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Colorado', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'FMR1', 'FMR1 Gene', 'FMR1 Premutation', 'FMR1 repeat expansion', 'FXTAS', 'Fellowship', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Gait abnormality', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intention Tremor', 'Laboratory Research', 'Length', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Rain', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Training Programs', 'Tremor', 'Trinucleotide Repeats', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'disability', 'genetic risk factor', 'improved', 'male', 'meetings', 'men', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'primary outcome', 'professor', 'programs', 'skills']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2010,173340,-0.01840652638208407
"Clinical Validation of BCT - Phase II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fracture risk assessment is integral to the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, a devastating clinical condition of which over 40 million Americans are at risk. Due to limitations in areal BMD measures obtained from 2D DXA scans - the current clinical standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis - it has recently become clear that those at risk of osteoporotic fracture need to be better identified. A 3D biomechanics-based technique, which we term Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT), addresses this need through a combination of engineering finite element analysis, 3D quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and bone fracture biomechanics. The main outcome parameter of BCT is an estimate of the biomechanical risk of a bone fracture that accounts for such factors as the patient's 3D bone geometry and distribution of bone density, body-weight, height, trochanteric soft tissue thickness (for hip fractures), muscle moment arm (for spine), and the age-related risk of sustaining an overload event (such as a fall or lifting of a heavy object with back bent). In the larger context of translating BCT to clinical practice, we seek in this Phase II SBIR project to test the overall hypothesis that BCT is a better predictor of osteoporotic fracture than is areal BMD, for both hip and spine fracture and for both women and men. In Phase I of this project, we successfully applied this technique to explain observed age-related trends in hip fracture rates. For Phase II, we plan in our first Aim to refine our BCT technique to produce a fully automated, highly reliable and highly accurate software suite with the capability to analyze CT scans acquired for any medical test with coverage of the hip and/or spine without an external calibration phantom. For Aim 2, in order to ensure optimal prediction of clinical fractures, we will further refine our overall BCT process by calibrating results from the two cohorts (the Mayo Clinic cohort of 750 men and women in Rochester MN, and the MrOS cohort of 3,500 men in six U.S. locations). Issues to be resolved in this calibration process include determining optimal methods for measuring soft tissue thickness, muscle moment arms, and spine loading. This analysis will also enable us to calibrate our function for age- related risk of sustaining an overload event, which may depend on both fracture type (hip vs. spine) and sex. In Aim 3, we will compile normative data for BCT outcomes, critical information for interpretation of clinical results. Having refined and calibrated the overall BCT technique and identified the most successful BCT predictors of clinical fracture in the Mayo and MrOS cohorts, we will proceed in Aim 4 to test the validity of these predictors in a fully prospective manner, without any further modification of the BCT technique. For this, we will analyze the AGES cohort of 5,500 women and men in Reykjavik, Iceland, for incident hip and spine fracture. Taken together, this multi-cohort international validation study will provide new insight into osteoporotic fracture etiology, important advancements for the BCT method, and a thorough evaluation of BCT clinical performance. This project should therefore have a significant impact on osteoporosis research and clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Successful translation of BCT to clinical practice has the potential to greatly improve non-invasive assessment of fracture risk, which would represent an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.

"Medications Prescribed in Emergency Departments for Non-Traumatic Dental Conditio    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a growing attention paid by policymakers and health care researchers to the use of emergency departments (ED) for the provision of primary care services because of the continuous increase in medical and dental healthcare cost in the United States. Most patients present to ED with non-traumatic dental conditions (NTDC) and non-urgent medical conditions based on medical criteria. ED use for NTDC visits is a growing dental public health concern that requires urgent research attention. NTDC visits to ED have cost, practice, and program implications and is a potential reason for overcrowding at EDs. However, not enough is known about the population groups and treatments received by these patients at the ED for NTDC visits. NTDCs are best treated at dental offices were definitive and continuity of care can be provided. The overall goal of this project is to address the gap in knowledge related to prescription medications for NTDC visits at EDs and to explore whether racial/ethnic disparities exist in prescribing practices. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to estimate the prevalence and trend of prescription medication use for NTDC visits at EDs from 1996 to 2006. (2) to determine patient factors, provider types, hospital/ED, and geographic characteristics associated with the receipt of prescription medications for NTDC visits from 1996 to 2006. (3) to determine the rates of use of prescription medication for NTDC visits based on physician diagnosis codes, and to specifically evaluate the influence of patients' race/ethnicity on the likelihood of receiving similar prescription for the same physician diagnosis codes. The database for the proposed study, the 1996-2006 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), is the longest continuously running nationally representative survey of ED utilization maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics. Data from NHAMCS provides an extremely rich set of measures on key patient demographics, geographic and hospital/ED characteristics, and provider Information. Access to the database provides a unique opportunity to examine medication prescription practices from 1996 to 2006 to patients presenting to ED for NTDC visits and whether disparities exists. The study population will include children and adults in the database with assigned International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code by ED healthcare providers that meet the criteria for NTDC visits. Logistic regression models will be fit to determine outcome variables associated with other covariates. The findings from the proposed study would serve as a starting point for the development of data-driven program and policy interventions that can be used to improve access to dental care and reduce oral health care disparities, if they exist. Findings from the study will be used to inform the development of prescription medication treatment guidelines for managing patients presenting to ED for NTDC visits in situation where it is unavoidable. In addition, the project provides the opportunity to build research capacity within the dental school and to train dental and graduate students in research methods for potential careers in research.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying the different population groups and the medications prescribed for NTDC visits at EDs is important for dental public health programming. Dental public health professionals and stakeholders are able to use this information to development appropriate intervention strategies including the formulation of an appropriate national medication guideline for NTDC visits at EDs, where it is unavoidable.             Public Health Relevance: Identifying the different population groups and the medications prescribed for NTDC visits at EDs is important for dental public health programming.

"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.    The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.    We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.    If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecasts that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.

"Clinical Validation of BCT - Phase II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fracture risk assessment is integral to the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, a devastating clinical condition of which over 40 million Americans are at risk. Due to limitations in areal BMD measures obtained from 2D DXA scans - the current clinical standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis - it has recently become clear that those at risk of osteoporotic fracture need to be better identified. A 3D biomechanics-based technique, which we term Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT), addresses this need through a combination of engineering finite element analysis, 3D quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and bone fracture biomechanics. The main outcome parameter of BCT is an estimate of the biomechanical risk of a bone fracture that accounts for such factors as the patient's 3D bone geometry and distribution of bone density, body-weight, height, trochanteric soft tissue thickness (for hip fractures), muscle moment arm (for spine), and the age-related risk of sustaining an overload event (such as a fall or lifting of a heavy object with back bent). In the larger context of translating BCT to clinical practice, we seek in this Phase II SBIR project to test the overall hypothesis that BCT is a better predictor of osteoporotic fracture than is areal BMD, for both hip and spine fracture and for both women and men. In Phase I of this project, we successfully applied this technique to explain observed age-related trends in hip fracture rates. For Phase II, we plan in our first Aim to refine our BCT technique to produce a fully automated, highly reliable and highly accurate software suite with the capability to analyze CT scans acquired for any medical test with coverage of the hip and/or spine without an external calibration phantom. For Aim 2, in order to ensure optimal prediction of clinical fractures, we will further refine our overall BCT process by calibrating results from the two cohorts (the Mayo Clinic cohort of 750 men and women in Rochester MN, and the MrOS cohort of 3,500 men in six U.S. locations). Issues to be resolved in this calibration process include determining optimal methods for measuring soft tissue thickness, muscle moment arms, and spine loading. This analysis will also enable us to calibrate our function for age- related risk of sustaining an overload event, which may depend on both fracture type (hip vs. spine) and sex. In Aim 3, we will compile normative data for BCT outcomes, critical information for interpretation of clinical results. Having refined and calibrated the overall BCT technique and identified the most successful BCT predictors of clinical fracture in the Mayo and MrOS cohorts, we will proceed in Aim 4 to test the validity of these predictors in a fully prospective manner, without any further modification of the BCT technique. For this, we will analyze the AGES cohort of 5,500 women and men in Reykjavik, Iceland, for incident hip and spine fracture. Taken together, this multi-cohort international validation study will provide new insight into osteoporotic fracture etiology, important advancements for the BCT method, and a thorough evaluation of BCT clinical performance. This project should therefore have a significant impact on osteoporosis research and clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Successful translation of BCT to clinical practice has the potential to greatly improve non-invasive assessment of fracture risk, which would represent an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.           Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis.

"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision.

"Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health-care acquired pneumonia (HCAP) is a newly-recognized clinical entity which has a higher morbidity and mortality than community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Patients with HCAP are at risk for multi-drug resistant organisms due to past healthcare exposures such as recent hospitalizations, nursing homes, and dialysis units, and tend to have a high burden of co-morbid illnesses. The 2005 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend that patients diagnosed with HCAP be treated initially with 3 broad- spectrum antibiotics; however, the evidence behind these recommendations comes from several small observational trials. These studies show that compared to patients with CAP, patients with HCAP have higher mortality and are more likely to be treated with inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy, but it is not known whether widespread use of several broad-spectrum agents will improve patient outcomes. Because these antibiotics can cause serious side effects and are often expensive, physicians may be hesitant to prescribe according to the guidelines without more evidence of their comparative effectiveness. We will conduct a retrospective cohort study using highly detailed patient-level claims and microbiological data contained in the Perspective data warehouse (PREMIER Healthcare Inc.) from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008 from 550 participating hospitals in the United States. We will examine data from hospitalized patients  = 18 years of age who were admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia. The aim of our study is to determine whether patients hospitalized for HCAP have worse outcomes than those admitted for CAP, whether differences in outcome are due to co-morbid illnesses or to resistant organisms, and whether HCAP patients who are treated with the empiric antibiotic regimen recommended by the ATS-IDSA guidelines have better outcomes (lower mortality, fewer complications, shorter length-of stay and lower costs) than patients treated with other antibiotics. Our study will use sophisticated statistical methods, including logistic regression, propensity matching and an adaptation of the instrumental variable approach, to adjust for pre- treatment differences between patients and compare the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens. Our results will help to guide physicians in the treatment of individual patients and aid experts in developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Information we discover about physician practice patterns will also help quality officers and policy-makers identify areas for improvement in the care of this common and deadly illness.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia"" will provide important insight into a clinical dilemma faced by physicians who care for as many as 300,000 patients each year with Healthcare-Associated pneumonia (HCAP). This study will assess whether patients with HCAP are receiving care consistent with the recommendations found in guidelines developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America, and whether those treated according to the guidelines have better outcomes than patients who are treated with other antibiotics. These results will help clinicians balance the potential benefits of the recommended antibiotics against the potential harms of antibiotic side effects, future antibiotic resistance, and increased costs. If recommended therapy is beneficial but underutilized, these results will alert quality improvement officers and policy makers to an important opportunity to improve patient care for a common and deadly illness.           Project Narrative ""Quality of Care and Outcomes of Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia"" will provide important insight into a clinical dilemma faced by physicians who care for as many as 300,000 patients each year with Healthcare-Associated pneumonia (HCAP).

"Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persons with a primary malignant brain tumor (PMBT) often suffer significant functional and neurologic morbidity causing family caregivers to assume the care recipient's familial, social, and financial obligations. Research has shown that caregivers of persons with other chronic diseases develop negative consequences as a result of providing care. Despite high morbidity (and mortality) rates for persons with a PMBT, caregiver issues in neuro-oncology have been virtually ignored. In response to PA-05-027, the purposes of this study are to use a multidisciplinary, integrative model, the Pittsburgh Mind Body Center Model, to (1) examine the psycho-behavioral responses (i.e. depressive symptoms and sleep), biologic responses (i.e. blood pressure and ihterleukins) and overall physical health of family members of persons with a PMBT at the time of diagnosis, and (2) to describe how relationships within the model vary over time in response to changes in the care recipient's illness trajectory as the family member transitions to a family caregiver. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) examine how care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho- behavioral responses, biologic responses, and overall physical health change over time (from PBMT diagnosis to 12 months after diagnosis); and during this 12-month period, to 2) examine how caregivers' personal characteristics moderate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho-behavioral responses; 3) examine how caregiver psycho-behavioral responses mediate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' biologic responses; and 4) examine how caregivers' biologic responses mediate the relationship between their psycho-behavioral responses and overall physical health. A descriptive longitudinal design will be used to collect data to address the aims of the project. Linear and logistic regression analysis will be used to model baseline responses. Repeated measures analysis (random coefficients modeling) will be used to examine change over time and latent growth curve modeling will be used to further explore longitudinal data. The relevance of the project to public health is to identify caregivers at specific time-points during the care recipient's disease trajectory who are vulnerable to changes in their emotional and physical health. Improving caregivers' emotional and physical health may improve the delivery of care and quality of life for the care recipient.           n/a",Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers,7896527,R01CA118711,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Endocrine', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Face', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Functional disorder', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Rate', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Institutionalization', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Obligations', 'Stress', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'body-mind', 'burnout', 'care delivery', 'depressive symptoms', 'disease characteristic', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'longitudinal design', 'loved ones', 'meetings', 'mind body interaction', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'social']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2010,401653,0.009425789000274623
"AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (01): Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention, and specific Challenge Topic 03-MH-101: Biomarkers in Mental Disorders. Clinically significant depressive symptoms have been reported in up to 86% of nursing home residents [Brodaty01], with substantial under-recognition of the problem and excess morbidity and mortality in individuals with dementia. The sensitivity of current depression detection approaches deteriorates notably with progressive cognitive impairment due to: (i) diminishing ability of demented subjects to communicate affective states, (ii) critical overlap between the neurovegetative symptoms of depression and the neuropsychiatric features of dementia (e.g., apathy), and (iii) the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms in the context of dementia [Bielinski06]. In order to improve the assessment of depression in dementia patients, the NIMH has proposed modifications to the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder that 1) highlight the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms, 2) addition of social withdrawal and irritability items, and 3) substitution of the anhedonia criterion with ""decreased positive affect or pleasure in response to social contact and usual activities"" [Olin02]. As the subject's ability to report internal affective states diminishes, however, activity and behavioral correlates of depression such as verbal and motor agitation, physical aggression, care resistance, and food/fluid refusal become important markers of possible depression [Bielinski06]. Emerging video, audio and sensor technologies hold promise for quantifying and automating the detection of such activities and behaviors, and thus identifying stages of depression that may be differentially responsive to various prevention and intervention strategies. We propose to overcome the under-diagnosis and failed recognition of symptoms of depression in dementia by applying real-time continuous video and audio recordings in the non-private spaces of a nursing home special care dementia unit (SCU; 16 total beds), as well as sensor recordings (radiofrequency identification tags, motion, contact and pressure sensors) throughout all the SCU spaces to capture the consenting subjects' activities, behaviors and social interaction patterns.

"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,7941068,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2010,496075,0.013777879165244996
"Integrated Cardio-Renal Risk Prediction Models in Type 1 Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application addresses broad Challenge Area (03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation, and the specific Challenge Topic that this application addresses is: 03-DK-101 Discovery of biomarkers for disease risk, progression or response to therapy in diseases of interest to NIDDK. The Challenge: Despite tremendous progress in treatment, patients with type 1 diabetes continue to die 15 years earlier, experience excess morbidity and have medical costs over 10 times higher than the general population. The risk of coronary artery disease and diabetic nephropathy is still greatly increased and responsible for 80% of deaths in these patients. Diabetic nephropathy and coronary artery disease are intertwined, suggesting common pathways, and yet current risk prediction is inadequate. Study Rationale: Nearly 25% of T1D patients develop end-stage renal disease. The conventional theory is that the sequence of events leading to diabetic nephropathy begins from microalbuminuria, progressing to overt proteinuria and eventual end-stage renal disease. Primary prevention with ACE/ARB treatment usually begins when persistent microalbuminuria is found. However, recent prospective studies using serial measurements of kidney function estimated from serum cystatin C have changed this paradigm by demonstrating that decline in glomerular filtration may begin in the absence of microalbuminuria or continue despite remission of microalbuminuria. By their mid 40's, over 70% of men and 50% of women with type 1 diabetes develop coronary artery calcification (CAC) - a marker of significant atherosclerotic plaque burden. Cardiovascular disease is particularly prevalent among patients with renal disease, but most cardiac events occur in patients with normal albumin excretion rates. Evidence has accumulated that diabetic nephropathy and CAC are parallel, rather than sequential, complications of type 1 diabetes, sharing a number of important predictors. Accurate prediction of the individual's global cardio-renal risk is needed to guide treatment choices. As a result, there is a recognized need for better risk partitioning, either from the discovery of additional biomarkers or the application of superior methods for discrimination of disease states. Our Approach: We are proposing to use the biobank of 652 adults with type 1 diabetes who have been thoroughly genotyped and prospectively followed for development of diabetic nephropathy and coronary artery disease by the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes study (CACTI, R01 HL61753, 1999- 2009) to develop and validate integrated biomarker prediction models for cardio-renal complications in type 1 diabetes. Our study aims are the investigation of biomarkers within the well-characterized CACTI cohort for 1) early progressive renal function decline, 2) the presence and progression of coronary artery calcium, and the 3) development of combined renal and cardiovascular disease burden. Renal disease and coronary artery disease (CAD) are the leading causes of death among adults with type 1 diabetes, but traditional screening tests (urinary albumin and serum creatinine) for renal disease are inadequate, and traditional CAD risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity) do not fully explain the increased burden of disease associated with type 1 diabetes. Renal and cardiovascular complications are intertwined, suggesting shared pathways. Increased systemic inflammation is present in type 1 diabetes and inflammatory mediators such as uric acid, vitamin D and bone metabolism markers have been suggested to play a role in both renal and cardiovascular diseases. As a result, it is of critical public health importance to discover and validate new biomarkers for cardio-renal disease among adults with type 1 diabetes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Renal disease and coronary artery disease (CAD) are the leading causes of death among adults with type 1 diabetes, but traditional screening tests (urinary albumin and serum creatinine) for renal disease are inadequate, and traditional CAD risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity) do not fully explain the increased burden of disease associated with type 1 diabetes.

"Screening and Brief Intervention in the ED among Mexican-origin Young Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening and Brief Intervention in the ED among Mexican-origin Young Adults The aims of this application ""Screening and Brief Alcohol Intervention in Underage and Young Adult Populations"" are to: 1) examine the effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) among Mexican-origin young adults (age 18-25), using a motivational intervention delivered by a Health Promotion Advocate (promotore), relative to standard care with and without assessment, on a reduction in heavy drinking (drinking days per week, number of drinks per day, maximum number of drinks on an occasion) and alcohol-related problems (RAPS4 and SIPS +6) in the emergency department (ED) at the U.S.- Mexico border; and, 2) identify variables that are related to effectiveness of the intervention and that predict successful treatment outcome. We plan to translate motivational interventions that have been successful in primary care and which were recently implemented in the U.S. 14 Academic Emergency Medicine Collaborative (AEMC) SBIRT study to a population of young adult Mexican-origin ED patients on the Texas border in El Paso; a population which has evidenced a high prevalence of hazardous drinking and alcohol- related problems, in part due to the greater availability of alcohol and at low cost in Mexico border cities. The SBIRT study, funded by NIAAA and SAAMHSA, was the first multi-site, collaborative study of screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED. We will conduct a blinded randomized control brief motivational intervention trial in which both injured and non-injured patients will be screened for at- risk or dependent (using the RAPS4) drinking. Patients screening positive who consent to participate in the study will be randomized into one of three groups: screened only, assessed, and assessed plus brief intervention, with n=312 in each group. Intervention and assessment groups will be followed-up at 3 months and all three groups at 12 months. Modifying variables include drinking in the event, risk-taking disposition, readiness and stage of change, country of birth (U.S. vs. Mexico) and language in which the assessment and intervention were conducted (English vs. Spanish). Outcome data will be analyzed using ANOVA, logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations. The interaction of modifying variables on outcomes will also be analyzed. Additionally, the study will examine data relevant to key issues related to the potential translatability and public health impact of the intervention and next steps. Given the paucity of published studies of brief intervention in the ED among young adults in general, or among Mexican-origin adults, and none among Mexican-origin young adults, who may be most vulnerable to alcohol use problems and disorders, especially at the border, work to be undertaken in this application is especially important in determining the effectiveness of AEMC SBIRT protocols (which may serve as a prototype for screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED) in this context of Mexican-origin young adults.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work is especially relevant to public health in relation to reducing subsequent alcohol-related ED visits and associated costs and increase quality of life among young adults. The project will inform the development and spread of more effective techniques and protocols for addressing at-risk and dependent drinking in the ED in this age group, and provide a better understanding of those factors that influence effectiveness of brief intervention and predict successful patient outcomes across ethnic and cultural groups in the U.S. Additionally, this will be the first randomized controlled clinical trial compared to standard care of brief intervention using promotores in the Mexican-origin community, which may provide a better chance of ongoing implementation of SBIRT in the ED than using ED staff providers.              Relevance Statement This work is especially relevant to public health in relation to reducing subsequent alcohol-related ED visits and associated costs and increase quality of life among young adults.

"Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in hospital electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring technology, monitoring practices are inconsistent and often inadequate. We recently published new practice standards for ECG monitoring. The primary purpose of our proposed 5-year multisite randomized clinical trial, which is guided by the knowledge transfer framework, is to test the effect of implementing these standards on nurses' knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. We will also explore the sustainability of effects in the experimental group and the effect of the delayed intervention in the control group. We expect that increased knowledge and skills of nurses will lead to enhanced quality of care, which will result in improved outcomes for patients. Units serving cardiac patients in 16 hospitals will participate. Hospitals will be randomized to the experimental or control group after baseline measures of knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes are obtained. The intervention will include ECG monitoring education and strategies to implement and sustain change. The education will be Web-based and include 4 modules: essentials of ECG monitoring, arrhythmia monitoring, ischemia monitoring, and QT interval monitoring. The standardization of content, flexibility of use, immediate feedback in both practice and testing sections are advantages of Web-based education. The use of simulations to test skills makes our program innovative. The strategies to implement and sustain change in the clinical area include reinforcement of education, incentives, and the designation of  champions  on each unit who will actively promote the implementation of the practice standards. Statistical analyses will account for intra-cluster correlation at the hospital level. Most outcomes are categorical with 2 levels, whereas knowledge and skill scores are continuous. For categorical outcomes, two approaches will be considered: logistic regression models complemented with intra-cluster correlation using generalized estimating equations methods and extended Mantel-Haenszel cross-tabulation methods stratifying by cluster. For continuous outcomes, mixed modeling will be used to account for intra-cluster correlation through hierarchical linear models. We developed the new practice standards to improve hospital ECG monitoring. We expect that improved ECG monitoring will result in more accurate diagnosis and more timely treatment, which will lead to better outcomes for patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to test the effect of implementing new practice standards for electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring on nurses  knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. If implementation of the practice standards is associated with improvement in quality of care and patient outcomes, then there is the potential for improved care and outcomes for the literally millions of patients who require continuous ECG monitoring while hospitalized.          n/a",Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring,7867849,R01HL081642,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardioscopes', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Units', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Simulate', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular nursing', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'flexibility', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nursing skill', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,759696,0.021734089468340562
"Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The medical record for a neuro-oncology patient is complex, consisting of typically a large number of both text and imaging data. It includes descriptions of prior observations, interpretations, and interventions which need to be integrated into decisions regarding current patient care. An appropriate review of a patient's medical record often requires that a physician review multiple clinical documents while mentally noting issues related to what the findings were, the chronology of events, spatial/temporal patterns of disease progression, the effects of interventions, and the possible causal lines of explanation of observed findings. Additionally, imaging data and imaging- derived conclusions are poorly integrated into patient care and management decisions. The physician also needs to filter out those pieces of information not related to the current clinical context of care. Given the time constraints, data complexity and data volume associated with chronic patient cases, an appropriate review of a patient's chart is in reality rarely performed. Additionally, the lack of tools for formalizing the representation of the accounts of current and prior cases impedes the development of clinical databases that can be ultimately used to learn patterns of disease.       This proposal addresses the development of a system for facilitating the review of clinical patient data intended to promote an orderly process of medical problem understanding and care. The specific aims of the proposal are summarized as follows: 1) Development of a backend tool to facilitate the structured representation of observations, events, and inferences stated within medical reports. 2) Development of an application interface for visualizing, navigating, and editing structured patient data. 3) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the application in the domain of neuro-oncology.       Relation to public health. If the goals of this proposal can be realized, neuro-oncologist should be able to more easily seek desired patient data and detect patterns of evidence as compared to the current mode of operation (HIS, RIS, PACS). The structuring tools should lead to improvements in the quality of clinical research databases.           Narrative Medical records for neuro-oncology patients are difficult to review due to volume and complexity of information.

"FT-IR Microscopy of Mineral Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is responsible for approximately 1.5 million fractures in the US per year, with 300,000 of these fractures occurring at the hip at a cost exceeding $17 billion. The NIH Consensus conference and the World Health Organization defined osteoporosis as ""...compromised bone strength predisposing to an increased risk of fracture"". A variety of genetic and environmental factors, as well as bone properties (geometric and material), contribute to the bone loss that is associated with osteoporosis, but the question remains as to which factors primarily contribute to fracture risk. While reduced bone mineral density (BMD) relative to young individuals is routinely used clinically to predict fracture risk, BMD is not a strong predictor, with the majority of fractures occurring in patients with BMD's above the osteoporotic threshold. We have recently shown by multiple logistic regression analysis that specific mineral and matrix properties assessed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging (FTIRI) are predictive of fracture in postmenopausal women, while BMD is not significantly associated with fracture incidence. In a limited number of samples we have also shown that these FTIR parameters are correlated with nanomechanical properties. We hypothesize that variation in crystallinity (XST) and collagen maturity (XLR) partially explains the difference in incidence of fractures in individuals with similar BMDs. We further hypothesize that heterogeneity in these parameters is an additional determinant of fracture incidence, especially in trabecular bone. In the proposed studies we will test 4 hypotheses. 1) For any subject, FTIRI data obtained in the cortical and cancellous bone of the iliac crest (generally a non-fracturing site) is representative of that from sites that fracture (subtrochanter/greater trochanter). Further, the data are independent of the size of the biopsy as long as cortical and cancellous bone areas are included. This will be tested using multiple biopsies from cadavers and from clinic patients with fractures. Measures will include micro-CT analysis of BMD and architecture, and FTIRI. 2) Decreased heterogeneity in FTIRI mineral and matrix properties, in addition to increased XST and XLR, are predictive of fracture in humans. This will be tested by extending our logistic regression to heterogeneity parameters. Variation in tissue properties with age will be studied in patients with idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. Tissue mechanical properties will be correlated with FTIRI data. 3) An anabolic agent (PTH) can restore mechanical properties, and the XST, XLR, and mineral and matrix heterogeneity in animal models as well as in osteoporotic humans. This will be tested by analyses of pre- and post- treatment human biopsies and by analyses in a sheep model. 4) XLR, which is altered in osteoporosis, is related to collagen orientation. As part of our continued parameter validation, this will be tested by comparing FTIRI and second harmonic heneration microscopy data. Testing of these four hypotheses will provide new insights into the efficacy of therapies and contribute to the understanding of factors leading to fracture.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this continuing investigation is to discover what changes in bone properties cause a bone in a person with osteoporosis to break; we have suggestive evidence that changes in the structure and composition of the bone composite (mineral and matrix) put bones at risk of breaking during normal activities of daily life. Correlations are sought between spatial variation in parameters obtained by vibrational spectroscopy and mechanical properties. This information should lead to improved diagnosis and new approaches to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, the ""silent epidemic"".              The objective of this continuing investigation is to discover what changes in bone properties cause a bone in a person with osteoporosis to break; we have suggestive evidence that changes in the structure and composition of the bone composite (mineral and matrix) put bones at risk of breaking during normal activities of daily life.

"Clinical Validation of BCT - Phase II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fracture risk assessment is integral to the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, a devastating clinical condition of which over 40 million Americans are at risk. Due to limitations in areal BMD measures obtained from 2D DXA scans - the current clinical standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis - it has recently become clear that those at risk of osteoporotic fracture need to be better identified. A 3D biomechanics-based technique, which we term Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT), addresses this need through a combination of engineering finite element analysis, 3D quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and bone fracture biomechanics. The main outcome parameter of BCT is an estimate of the biomechanical risk of a bone fracture that accounts for such factors as the patient's 3D bone geometry and distribution of bone density, body-weight, height, trochanteric soft tissue thickness (for hip fractures), muscle moment arm (for spine), and the age-related risk of sustaining an overload event (such as a fall or lifting of a heavy object with back bent). In the larger context of translating BCT to clinical practice, we seek in this Phase II SBIR project to test the overall hypothesis that BCT is a better predictor of osteoporotic fracture than is areal BMD, for both hip and spine fracture and for both women and men. In Phase I of this project, we successfully applied this technique to explain observed age-related trends in hip fracture rates. For Phase II, we plan in our first Aim to refine our BCT technique to produce a fully automated, highly reliable and highly accurate software suite with the capability to analyze CT scans acquired for any medical test with coverage of the hip and/or spine without an external calibration phantom. For Aim 2, in order to ensure optimal prediction of clinical fractures, we will further refine our overall BCT process by calibrating results from the two cohorts (the Mayo Clinic cohort of 750 men and women in Rochester MN, and the MrOS cohort of 3,500 men in six U.S. locations). Issues to be resolved in this calibration process include determining optimal methods for measuring soft tissue thickness, muscle moment arms, and spine loading. This analysis will also enable us to calibrate our function for age- related risk of sustaining an overload event, which may depend on both fracture type (hip vs. spine) and sex. In Aim 3, we will compile normative data for BCT outcomes, critical information for interpretation of clinical results. Having refined and calibrated the overall BCT technique and identified the most successful BCT predictors of clinical fracture in the Mayo and MrOS cohorts, we will proceed in Aim 4 to test the validity of these predictors in a fully prospective manner, without any further modification of the BCT technique. For this, we will analyze the AGES cohort of 5,500 women and men in Reykjavik, Iceland, for incident hip and spine fracture. Taken together, this multi-cohort international validation study will provide new insight into osteoporotic fracture etiology, important advancements for the BCT method, and a thorough evaluation of BCT clinical performance. This project should therefore have a significant impact on osteoporosis research and clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Successful translation of BCT to clinical practice has the potential to greatly improve non-invasive assessment of fracture risk, which would represent an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.           Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis.

"Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders Dr. Deborah Ann Hall is applying for a mentored patient-oriented research (K23) award in the area of movement disorders. This proposal describes a research and training program for the development of a clinician-investigator in neurology. The principal investigator, Dr. Hall, has completed neurology residency  raining and a movement disorders fellowship. She received a competitive clinical research fellowship from the American Academy of Neurology and is pursuing a Ph.D. in Clinical Science. The candidate's immediate goals are to continue research in the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, by directly applying her newly acquired epidemiologic and biostatistics skills in the proposed project. Her long term goals are to study the genetic risk factors, neuroepidemiology, and treatment of ataxia, including sporadic ataxia. During the award period, Dr. Hall will be based in the Department of Neurology at the University of Colorado (UCDHSC). UCDHSC has an extensive track record for supporting and developing clinician-investigators. The Ph.D. in Clinical Sciences program at UCDHSC facilitates mentored multidisciplinary clinical research. The candidate will carry out her research with Professors Tim Byers MD (Epidemiology), Maureen Leehey MD (Neurology), Gary Zerbe PhD (Biostatistics), and Paul Hagerman MD PhD (Biological Chemistry). Dr. Hall's research program is to determine the prevalence of repeat expansions in the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation) gene in subjects with tremor, ataxia, and/or parkinsonism. Dr. Hall will do a cross- sectional study by recruiting subjects in her clinics with the three phenotypes and performing PCR of the FMR1 gene. All subjects eligible will be recruited and the genetic testing will be done in a research laboratory. The primary outcomes to be measured are the prevalence of repeat expansions in the three groups combined and each phenotypic subgroup. The age of onset, age of diagnosis of neurological signs, and correlations between trinucleotide repeat size and phenotype are also outcomes to be measured. Linear and logistic regression models will be used and covariates including race and ethnicity will be studied. Relevance: This study is important because it may define genetic risk factors for various abnormal movements, such as tremor. This will result in improved diagnosis and potentially treatment of individuals with progressive neurological diseases. These illnesses represent an important public health problem as they cause morbidity and mortality in our aging population. n/a",Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders,7591133,K23NS052487,"['Academy', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Award', 'Biochemistry', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Colorado', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'FMR1', 'FMR1 Gene', 'FMR1 Premutation', 'FMR1 repeat expansion', 'FXTAS', 'Fellowship', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Gait abnormality', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intention Tremor', 'Laboratory Research', 'Length', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Rain', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Training Programs', 'Tremor', 'Trinucleotide Repeats', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'disability', 'genetic risk factor', 'improved', 'male', 'meetings', 'men', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'primary outcome', 'professor', 'programs', 'skills']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2009,19263,-0.01840652638208407
"Cigarette Smoking among Head and Neck Cancer Patients: A Prospective Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Behavioral research with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients is high priority. The etiology of HNSCC is linked to the health risk behaviors of tobacco and alcohol consumption. At diagnosis, prevalence rates for cigarette smoking and alcohol use have been estimated to be above 80% and 65%, respectively. Among patients who report cigarette smoking in the year preceding diagnosis, about one-third continue to smoke following completion of cancer treatment. So while HNSCC diagnosis may be considered a ""teachable moment,"" in which motivation for health behavior change is theorized to be high, not all patients regard HNSCC diagnosis as a sufficient catalyst for cigarette smoking cessation. Notably, this is despite the fact that continued cigarette smoking is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including poorer treatment response and higher risk for recurrence. Researchers have made attempts to identify variables associated with cigarette smoking after HNSCC diagnosis, but the current literature is limited. The overall objective of the proposed project is to increase understanding of factors facilitating and impeding smoking cessation among patients recently diagnosed with HNSCC. Specific aims: (1) To characterize the trajectory of cigarette smoking from the time of HNSCC diagnosis to 6 months following initiation of cancer treatment, (2) To assess the utility of Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) for understanding changes in HNSCC patients' cigarette smoking, and (3) To assess the independent contribution of depressive symptoms and concurrent alcohol use for understanding changes in HNSCC patients' cigarette smoking. The above aims will be achieved using a prospective, longitudinal design in which 120 HNSCC patients are assessed before treatment initiation and then 2 and 6 months after treatment initiation. Males and females will be included in the study and the demographic characteristics of participants are expected to reflect the population of Kentucky. At each assessment, data will be collected via telephone interview. Study hypotheses will be tested using McNemar tests of paired comparisons, binomial logistic regression, and linear multiple regression analyses. Study results have the potential to highlight the importance of integrating discussions of behavior change into the course of cancer treatment, and may inform health personnel and behavioral science researchers of significant risk factors for cigarette smoking following HNSCC diagnosis. Results of the project may also be helpful in developing more efficacious smoking cessation interventions for HNSCC patients.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Overall, the proposed research is important because of its emphasis on understanding factors related to the reduction health risk behaviors, and associated improvement in clinical outcomes.           n/a",Cigarette Smoking among Head and Neck Cancer Patients: A Prospective Study,7679187,F31CA139956,"['Aftercare', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Female', 'Future', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Kentucky', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mental Health', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Paired Comparison', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Planning Theory', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoke', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'behavior change', 'cancer therapy', 'catalyst', 'cigarette smoking', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'high risk', 'longitudinal design', 'male', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'smoking cessation', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,F31,2009,38329,-0.036617603039383974
"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,7918523,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic Diseases', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Running', 'Rural Community', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'high risk', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2009,49991,0.006245088590132478
"Bedside emergency ultrasound for the evaluation of soft tissue infections    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Between 2001-2003 there were 11.6 million annual ambulatory care visits for skin and soft tissue infections, with a 31% increase in emergency department visits compared to the previous decade, according to the National Hospital AmbulatoryMedical Care Survey data. The majority of these infections are caused by community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) and most CA-MRSA infections are manifested as skin and soft tissue infections. As the prevalence of CA-MRSA continues to increase worldwide each year, with community outbreaks observed in multiple settings, it is not surprising that more and more hospitals are being affected by this surge in patient visits. Pediatric and general emergency departments are often the first line for diagnosis and treatment of these infections which may include a painful drainage procedure. A history and physical examination by a health care provider has thus far been the standard of care in diagnosing skin and soft tissue infections. At times inaccurate, the clinical exam can lead to misdiagnosing (either over or underestimating) a lesion that requires drainage. Emergency ultrasound (EUS) is a commonly used tool in general emergency departments for various diagnosis and treatments including the diagnosis of drainable soft tissue infections. The utility of EUS as an adjunct to the clinical examination in pediatric patients for soft tissue infections is unknown. The primary objective of this study is to determine and compare the sensitivity and specificity of clinical examination alone with that of the exam plus EUS in children. This will be done through a cross-sectional study design conducted in a large, urban, tertiary-care pediatric emergency department. Children with suggestion of soft tissue infection will be prospectively enrolled. Physicians are trained in bedside emergency ultrasound for evaluation of soft tissue infections prior to patient enrollment. The reference standard is the presence of a soft tissue infection requiring drainage defined as purulent material expressed if a drainage procedure is performed, or if no drainage is performed, the need for a drainage procedure or spontaneous drainage within two days of the initial visit. Sample size calculations are based upon a hypothesized change in sensitivity of at least 9% with the addition of EUS. Statistical analysis will include calculation of test characteristics, conditional logistic regression with model building, and derivation of ROC curves. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rise in visits for soft tissue infections is an important public health issue today. Emergency bedside ultrasound in children may offer improvement in the diagnosis of these infections, and therefore, ultimately may result in more rapid and appropriate treatment, with improved patient outcomes.                 n/a",Bedside emergency ultrasound for the evaluation of soft tissue infections,7674987,F32AI080063,"['4 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Drainage procedure', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Infection', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Design', 'Sample Size', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Skin', 'Soft Tissue Infections', 'Specificity', 'Suggestion', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'base', 'improved', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'public health relevance', 'standard of care', 'tertiary care', 'tool']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,F32,2009,61611,0.0011629974532711392
"Etiology, Epidemiology, and Clinical Outcomes of Health Care Associated Pneumonia    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) have periodically published guidelines on the diagnosis and management of pneumonia. In 2005, the ATS/IDSA published guidelines which define a new subset of pneumonia entitled Health Care Associated Pneumonia (HCAP). HCAP pertains to patients that have frequently interacted with the Health Care system prior to pneumonia, which is thought to increase risk for infections caused by multiple drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. The guidelines recommend aggressive diagnosis and antibiotic treatment regimens for HCAP. Research specific to HCAP is limited and the guideline recommendations have been questioned. Proposal Aims include: 1) to compare clinical outcome of patients with HCAP that receive standard community acquired pneumonia (CAP) therapy to those that receive alternative therapy such as guideline similar therapy (GTS)]; 2) identify risk factors for MDR bacteria including Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared to non-MDR bacteria and develop models that accurately identify patients infected with MDR. This will be a multi- center retrospective cohort study of Veterans Affairs Medical Center inpatients with HCAP. Propensity score matching will be used to adjust for potential confounding and selection bias associated with non-random treatment allocation. Generalized estimating equations will be used to characterize associations between 30-day survival and treatments: standard CAP; anti-MRSA and anti-Pseudomonas or GST, anti-MRSA, anti-Pseudomonas, or other therapies. In Aim 2 MDR status will be determined for all subjects. Logistic regression will be used to develop descriptive models of MDR risk based on non-HCAP specific risk criteria reported in the guidelines as well as HCAP specific data from the cohort. The process will be repeated for specific MDR pathogens: MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The best model of MDR status will be refitted with MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa data and compared to pathogen- specific derived models. The proposed study will determine whether adherence to HCAP guideline recommended treatments improve survival. Further developing specific prediction rules for MDR pathogens will refine future empirical HCAP antibiotic selection. Finally, determining which patients may benefit most from empirical MDR directed antibiotic therapy may help to limit antibiotic resistance. R&R: Other Project Materials 7. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Patients with exposure to the Health Care system resources are at increased risk for infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. The purpose of this study is to determine how frequently antibiotic resistant bacteria cause Health Care Associated pneumonia, what type of Health Care exposures are related to developing a pneumonia due to resistant bacteria, and what antibiotic treatment combinations work the best for Health Care Associated pneumonia. This study will improve public health by helping health care providers choose the right antibiotics when treating Health Care Associated pneumonia and not using more antibiotics than necessary.                n/a","Etiology, Epidemiology, and Clinical Outcomes of Health Care Associated Pneumonia",7640772,R03AI074894,"['Adherence', 'Alternative Therapies', 'American', 'Americas', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Cephalosporins', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Equation', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Macrolides', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Mono-S', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Pseudomonas', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Refit', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection Bias', 'Societies', 'Sputum', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'drug resistant bacteria', 'health care model', 'improved', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'standard care']",NIAID,IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2009,62312,0.018590469752937745

"The Effectiveness of Smoking Cessation Guidelines in the Emergency Department    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although 78% of smokers report that a health professional has previously advised them to quit smoking, most smokers are not advised to stop smoking or offered assistance with smoking cessation during a given ED visit. There are multiple barriers to routine implementation of smoking cessation guidelines by emergency clinicians, however, and rigorously performed clinical trials are needed to demonstrate that routine screening and counseling of ED patients results in increased quit rates. To determine the feasibility of implementing the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Smoking Cessation Guideline in the ED, we will conduct a clinical trial in 974 ambulatory adult smokers who present to 2 emergency departments, using a pre-post design. During the 3-month baseline period, clinicians will perform their usual duties but will not receive training in use of the AHRQ Guideline. Based on the Chronic Care Model, the 3-month intervention period will include: 1) a tutorial on brief cessation counseling for ED nurses and physicians, 2) use of an ED algorithm that includes recommended tobacco counseling items, 3) fax referral of motivated smokers to the Iowa Quitline for proactive telephone counseling plus free nicotine replacement therapy, and 4) group and individual feedback to ED staff. We will conduct exit interviews of ED patients to assess performance of guideline-recommended actions by ED staff and 3- and 6-month telephone follow-up to determine 7-day point-prevalence abstinence (with biochemical confirmation of self-reported quitters at 6 months). Our main analyses will examine the contrast between the intervention and control periods in the performance of guideline- recommended actions and in 6-month quit rates, using hierarchical logistic regression to adjust for baseline differences in potentially confounding patient variables. In secondary analyses, we will assess the change in attitudes of ED nurses and physicians toward smoking cessation counseling. This feasibility study will determine the receptivity of patients and ED staff to the guideline-based intervention and will provide estimates of effect size in planning a full scale multi-site clinical trial of the study intervention in community hospital EDs.          n/a",The Effectiveness of Smoking Cessation Guidelines in the Emergency Department,7651300,R21DA021607,"['Abstinence', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Biochemical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Hospitals', 'Counseling', 'Couples', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enrollment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Guidelines', 'Health Professional', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Iowa', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Modality', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Smoker', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Telefacsimile', 'Telephone', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'University Hospitals', 'Visit', 'alcohol abuse prevention', 'base', 'chronic care model', 'community based care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'multi-site trial', 'nicotine replacement', 'quitline', 'routine care', 'smoking cessation', 'success']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2009,112500,-0.0034589732151307537
"Early Acute Lung Injury: Prospective Evaluation Prior to Respiratory Failure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary and non-pulmonary insults and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite two decades of targeted investigation by the NHLBI, little is known about ALI prior to progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Accordingly, the aims of this research plan are to: 1) prospectively identify independent predictors of progression to ALI requiring mechanical ventilation and establish a clinical definition of early ALI; 2) evaluate the pathogenetic role of biologic markers of inflammation and lung injury and their value for refining risk stratification of patients at risk for progression to ALI, and 3) test the potential therapeutic value of an aerosolized beta-2 agonist in patients with early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 1 will identify cases of potential early ALI by screening chest radiographs of all adult emergency department and medicine service admissions. Patients admitted to the hospital with bilateral opacities on chest radiograph not due to isolated left atrial hypertension will be followed for progression to ALI during their hospitalization. Clinical characteristics (demographics, diagnoses, comorbidities, vital signs, and Borg dyspnea scores) will be recorded for the first 72 hours of admission. Independent predictors of progression to ALI will be determined by multivariate logistic regression and incorporated into a clinical definition of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 2, plasma levels of biomarkers (IL-8, sTNFr-1, vWF, ICAM-1, SP-D and RAGE) representing distinct pathways contributing to acute lung injury will be measured at time 0 and 24 hours after study enrollment. Biomarkers will be analyzed by multivariate regression analysis to assess their value for stratifying patients at risk for progression to ALI and provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of early ALI. In SPECIFIC AIM 3 I will conduct a randomized clinical trial of aerosoUzed albuterol vs. placebo in patients with early ALI. The primary endpoint will be the Pa02 / Fi02 on day 4 of treatment. Secondary outcome measures will be rate of progression to ALI and change in plasma biologic marker levels. This will be a first-of-its-kind trial to establish that patients with early ALI can be identified and treatment can be initiated prior to need for mechanical ventilation. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Following the paradigm of early goal-directed therapy for severe sepsis, clinical benefit may derive from identifying patients with early ALI and initiating treatment prior to the need for mechanical ventilation (and therefore prior to meeting current study entry criteria). Establishing evidence based clinical definition of early ALI will facilitate identification and risk stratification of subjects for enrollment in future clinical trials.

"Assessing an Adolescent Violence Screening Tool Longitudinally for Primary Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K award will be integral in the development of Dr. Sigel's career, which is focused on youth violence detection and intervention in the primary care setting. Dr. Sigel will work with the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence, under the primary mentorship of Dr. Terence Thornberry. To become an independent researcher in this field, the candidate has identified several skill sets that need enhancement, including: improving knowledge of psychometric properties of screening tools, improving ability to conduct longitudinal, randomized control intervention trials, learning skills to evaluate program implementation, increasing understanding of what interventions work for youth violence intervention, and understanding the interface between violence as a public health problem and how the medical setting can be used to address this issue. A combination of working at the CSPV, taking didactic classes, interfacing with the community, and carrying out the proposed research project will accomplish this. Long term career goals include: 1) becoming an independent clinical investigator in the field of youth violence assessment and intervention; 2) studying and implementing evidence-based interventions at the primary care level to decrease morbidity and mortality from youth violence and 3) establishing a center of excellence in youth violence assessment and treatment, in collaboration with community partners. The research project is: Assessing Predictive Validity at 1 and 2 Years of the Violence Injury, Protection and Risk Screening Tool for Primary Care. Specific Aim: Determine the predictive validity at one and two years of the Violence Injury, Protection and Risk Screening (VIPRS) Tool that identifies youth at risk for future violence involvement (aggression, violence perpetration, violence victimization, and injury from violence).Methods: An initial cohort of 165 youth, and 131 parents have been enrolled to evaluate the reliability and validity of the VIPRS cross-sectionally. This proposed study will examine the future predictive validity of the VIPRS by assessing the initial cohort of youth and parents at one and two year follow-up from initial enrollment. Questionnaires evaluating aggression and victimization will be administered, as well as repeating the VIPRS. Chart review will be done at one and two year follow-up to determine whether the primary care practitioner diagnosed any behavior related to violence involvement, or any violence related injury. Analysis The predictive validity of the VIPRS will be examined using multivariate linear or logistic regression analysis to determine whether:1) the VIPRS baseline scores are associated with violent behavior occurring between baseline and the one-year and two year follow-up interview; and 2) change in VIPRS scores from baseline to one-year is associated with violent behavior occurring between the one-year follow-up interview and the two-year follow-up interviews, adjusted for baseline VIPRS scores. Project Narrative/Relevance: This project is vital to the public health issue of youth violence. Primary care health professionals have not been actively involved in treating youth violence, mostly because it is time consuming and challenging to recognize youth at risk. By creating an easy to administer screening tool, health professionals will be able to recognize, and ultimately intervene before youth suffer the consequences of violence involvement.           n/a",Assessing an Adolescent Violence Screening Tool Longitudinally for Primary Care,7681002,K01CE001332,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K01,2009,141976,-0.009665285689804017
"Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award proposal describes the 5-year training program for Dr. Elliott R. Haut. The proposal builds upon the candidate's strengths and prior research skills, while utilizing the unique opportunities of The Johns Hopkins University. The mentorship of Dr. Peter Pronovost and formal advanced degree coursework in the Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation (GTPCI), will give Dr. Haut the tools and training to advance to the level of a fully independent health services researcher. Pay for performance and public reporting of quality are growing exponentially in medicine. Implicit in these systems is the assumed presence of a valid way to measure clinical quality. Many national agencies (AHRQ, NQF) have suggested deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence as a metric of health care quality. DVT is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, yet may be completely asymptomatic until the clot embolizes and causes sudden death from massive pulmonary embolism. Duplex ultrasound serves an important role as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DVT detection. However, screening asymptomatic trauma patients for DVT is controversial, these practices likely vary widely among hospitals, and no national agency has recommended a standardized screening approach. In the absence of standardized surveillance, DVT rates may be influenced more by how often caregivers look for these events rather than the quality of care provided. This is a classic example of surveillance bias in which event rates identified and reported may merely reflect levels of vigilance. Higher DVT rates may not be a marker of poor quality of care, but rather an outcome of more aggressive screening practices. Providers who look harder by ordering more screening duplex ultrasounds, may report higher rates of DVT, and appear to provide poorer quality of care than those providers who do not screen. Therefore, DVT rates reported may be unreliable measures of quality of care and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives. SA#1 will examine the impact of hospital-level ultrasound rates on DVT rates reported after major trauma. SA#2 will determine whether hospital duplex and DVT rates correlate with the presence of a hospital duplex ultrasound screening protocol for high-risk trauma patients. SA#3 will determine if patients are more likely to have DVT diagnosed and reported based on hospital characteristics, controlling for patient-level DVT risk factors using multi-level multiple logistic regression. Some hospitals use duplex ultrasound to screen asymptomatic trauma patients for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while other hospitals do not. Hospitals that screen trauma patients may identify and report higher DVT rates merely because they search for DVTs more aggressively. Therefore, reported DVT rates are unreliable quality of care measures and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives.             n/a",Does screening variability make DVT an unreliable quality measure of trauma care?,7639826,K08HS017952,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K08,2009,153790,0.005117968571602528
"Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders Dr. Deborah Ann Hall is applying for a mentored patient-oriented research (K23) award in the area of movement disorders. This proposal describes a research and training program for the development of a clinician-investigator in neurology. The principal investigator, Dr. Hall, has completed neurology residency  raining and a movement disorders fellowship. She received a competitive clinical research fellowship from the American Academy of Neurology and is pursuing a Ph.D. in Clinical Science. The candidate's immediate goals are to continue research in the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, by directly applying her newly acquired epidemiologic and biostatistics skills in the proposed project. Her long term goals are to study the genetic risk factors, neuroepidemiology, and treatment of ataxia, including sporadic ataxia. During the award period, Dr. Hall will be based in the Department of Neurology at the University of Colorado (UCDHSC). UCDHSC has an extensive track record for supporting and developing clinician-investigators. The Ph.D. in Clinical Sciences program at UCDHSC facilitates mentored multidisciplinary clinical research. The candidate will carry out her research with Professors Tim Byers MD (Epidemiology), Maureen Leehey MD (Neurology), Gary Zerbe PhD (Biostatistics), and Paul Hagerman MD PhD (Biological Chemistry). Dr. Hall's research program is to determine the prevalence of repeat expansions in the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation) gene in subjects with tremor, ataxia, and/or parkinsonism. Dr. Hall will do a cross- sectional study by recruiting subjects in her clinics with the three phenotypes and performing PCR of the FMR1 gene. All subjects eligible will be recruited and the genetic testing will be done in a research laboratory. The primary outcomes to be measured are the prevalence of repeat expansions in the three groups combined and each phenotypic subgroup. The age of onset, age of diagnosis of neurological signs, and correlations between trinucleotide repeat size and phenotype are also outcomes to be measured. Linear and logistic regression models will be used and covariates including race and ethnicity will be studied. Relevance: This study is important because it may define genetic risk factors for various abnormal movements, such as tremor. This will result in improved diagnosis and potentially treatment of individuals with progressive neurological diseases.

"An Automatic Notification System for Test Results Finalized after Discharge    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract: The transition to the ambulatory setting following hospital discharge is a vulnerable time for patients.  One important patient safety concern is failure of responsible providers to reliably follow up test results finalized after a patient is discharged. Such failure can lead to delays in diagnosis, missed treatment opportunities, redundant ordering of tests, and subsequent patient harm. Automated systems that ensure timely notification of these test results to responsible providers have the potential to mitigate these well documented problems and improve health care quality and safety. The goals of this project are to create an information technology-based automatic notification system to prompt responsible physicians of test results finalized after discharge and to evaluate the impact of this system on physician awareness of these test results. In the first phase of this study, the components of the system will be designed. These include 1) a query of all tests whose final results are pending at the time of discharge, 2) a query for the identity and email   addresses of the patient's responsible inpatient and ambulatory provider, 3) logic to exclude routinely ordered inpatient tests to avoid provider alert fatigue, 4) automatic email notification of finalized test results to responsible providers once they are available, and 5) documentation of these results in the ambulatory electronic medical record. The system is designed to facilitate timely communication and the creation of a collaborative plan of care among inpatient and outpatient providers during a patient's transition to the ambulatory setting. A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted to measure the impact of such a system on physician awareness. To minimize contamination, both inpatient and ambulatory providers will be randomized, and patients will only be enrolled if both responsible physicians are in the same arm of the study. Study subjects will include patients discharged from the inpatient general medicine and cardiology services at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The primary outcome will be awareness of all post-discharge test results among responsible providers. Secondary outcomes will include user satisfaction, awareness of actionable test results (as judged by providers), and whether appropriate actions are subsequently taken in response to these results (based on electronic medical record review). Physician awareness will be determined using an email survey to providers 72 hours after the first finalized test result is available. The primary outcome will be analyzed as the proportion of test results per patient of which a provider is aware using binomial logistic   regression. General estimating equations will be used to adjust for patient and physician characteristics and to cluster by physician. Over a six-month study period, 450 patients will be enrolled in order to provide adequate power to detect an improvement in awareness from 40% to 60% of results. The results of this study will inform future efforts to optimize this type of intervention both at BWH and at other institutions trying to solve this important patient safety problem.           Project Narrative: Physicians are often unaware of test results that return after a patient leaves the hospital, a problem which could lead to delays in diagnosis, missed treatment opportunities, unnecessary ordering of additional tests, and patient harm. The goal of this project is to develop an automatic notification system to ensure that a patient's physicians receive test results that are finalized after hospital discharge. We plan to study whether this system improves physicians' awareness of these test results and then share our findings so that other health care systems can learn from our experiences.",An Automatic Notification System for Test Results Finalized after Discharge,7773972,R21HS018229,[' '],AHRQ,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2009,169859,0.013342145815283259
"Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant continues to be associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Fifteen to 50% of patients die from complications related to the procedure. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affects 20-80% of transplant recipients and is the major cause of post transplant non-relapse mortality. While some clinical parameters (e.g. age, donor: recipient histocompatibility) can predict GVHD, no biological factors have been identified that reliably predict the incidence and severity of GVHD and its associated mortality, as well as allow an understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of the disease, which, in turn could inform innovative treatment approaches. Hence, there exists a critical need to identify reliable biomarkers for the disease. We hypothesize that polymorphisms in genes regulating biological pathways of GVHD are associated with GVHD and transplant related mortality (TRM). We propose a candidate gene approach to analyze, in 838 subjects (donors and recipients), the relationship of 427 genetic polymorphisms which may modulate the immune response, inflammatory amplification and the metabolism of therapeutic agents with the incidence and course of GVHD and transplant related mortality. We will use conventional multiple variable regression analysis to identify relevant polymorphisms and will test novel machine based learning and graph based algorithms to identify gene patterns or interactions not recognizable with usual statistical techniques. Reliable genetic biomarkers would permit identification of high risk patients who need more effective prophylaxis or preemptive screening or therapeutic interventions to limit the severity of their graft versus host disease and ultimately to improve survival. Validation of our findings in a subsequent multicenter cohort could provide important data useful to inform the management of allograft patients and improve their outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Graft-versus-host disease is a devastating disease that affects 20-70% of blood and marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. The disease is caused by an immune attack by donor cells on patient tissue. Some genetic factors, including polymorphisms (changes in amino acids in genes that alter their function) may predict patients at high risk of these complications. We aim to identify patients at high risk of complications and death, and subsequently modify their treatment, using the information we learn from our genetic studies, to alter their course. Our long term goal is to improve survival in these patients by determining groups at high risk towards whom intensive therapy should be targeted.          n/a",Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve,7648231,R21AI079354,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Graft Versus Host Disease', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allogenic', 'Allografting', 'Amino Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Transplants', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cytokine Gene', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'chronic graft versus host disease', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug metabolism', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'graft vs host disease', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2009,221910,-0.02649763783238876
"Predictors of Hospital-Acquired Urinary Tract-Related Bloodstream Infection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preventive efforts to reduce urinary tract-related bloodstream infection are hampered by the scarcity of analytic studies that identify etiologic factors, particularly those specific to the time-dependent elements that may impact prognosis during hospitalization. Therefore, the ability of clinicians to intercede in a meaningful way has been restricted. The objective of this study is to delineate both host- and time-dependent factors that contribute to urinary tract-related bloodstream infection in hospitalized patients. This study is unique in that it will ascertain potential causal mechanisms of bloodstream infection taking into account the time course of a hospitalized patient's stay and the multiple procedures and treatments that occur during this stay. Specific Aim #1 addresses the relation between obesity, diabetes, and urosepsis. Specific Aim #2 is directed to time-related procedural and treatment factors that impact the incidence of infection. Of particular interest are the use of catheterization, ultrasound detection of urinary retention, antibiotics, immunosuppressant therapies, statin use, and allogeneic blood transfusions. A nested case-control study is planned that will include adult patients from the University of Michigan Health System. Incidence density sampling will be utilized for random selection of controls. Information from cases and controls will be extracted from multiple electronic databases (electronic medical, pharmacy, and laboratory records) over a 5-year period to yield 640 subjects. Analyses will identify factors related to the development of urinary tract-related bloodstream infection in hospitalized patients. Conditional logistic regression with clustering by ward will be utilized for the analyses, as well as sliding time windows for log-linear models and cubic B-splines with time-specific weight functions. We anticipate that the information obtained from the proposed study   which evaluates novel risk factors and is responsive to program announcement PA-06-151 by utilizing secondary data   will enhance tools for clinical decision making and provide a framework for preventive trials. Urinary tract infection is the most frequent healthcare-associated infection and, when disseminated to the bloodstream, can be fatal. The mortality rate of urinary tract-related bloodstream infection varies from 5% to 33% in different cohorts and is considerably higher in elderly patients. We anticipate that the information obtained from this study will form the foundation for the development of screening tests to identify patients at risk of infection at specific points in time during hospitalization and for planning preventive intervention trials.

"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.    The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.    We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.    If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecasts that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.

Therefore, their successful forecast can lead to a paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and ehance the efficiency in a neurocritical care.",Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units,7698781,R01NS066008,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain scan', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebral Ventricles', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Professional', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prophylactic', 'public health relevance', 'time interval']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2009,336875,0.01875288004431674
"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision.

"Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persons with a primary malignant brain tumor (PMBT) often suffer significant functional and neurologic morbidity causing family caregivers to assume the care recipient's familial, social, and financial obligations. Research has shown that caregivers of persons with other chronic diseases develop negative consequences as a result of providing care. Despite high morbidity (and mortality) rates for persons with a PMBT, caregiver issues in neuro-oncology have been virtually ignored. In response to PA-05-027, the purposes of this study are to use a multidisciplinary, integrative model, the Pittsburgh Mind Body Center Model, to (1) examine the psycho-behavioral responses (i.e. depressive symptoms and sleep), biologic responses (i.e. blood pressure and ihterleukins) and overall physical health of family members of persons with a PMBT at the time of diagnosis, and (2) to describe how relationships within the model vary over time in response to changes in the care recipient's illness trajectory as the family member transitions to a family caregiver. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) examine how care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho- behavioral responses, biologic responses, and overall physical health change over time (from PBMT diagnosis to 12 months after diagnosis); and during this 12-month period, to 2) examine how caregivers' personal characteristics moderate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho-behavioral responses; 3) examine how caregiver psycho-behavioral responses mediate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' biologic responses; and 4) examine how caregivers' biologic responses mediate the relationship between their psycho-behavioral responses and overall physical health. A descriptive longitudinal design will be used to collect data to address the aims of the project. Linear and logistic regression analysis will be used to model baseline responses. Repeated measures analysis (random coefficients modeling) will be used to examine change over time and latent growth curve modeling will be used to further explore longitudinal data. The relevance of the project to public health is to identify caregivers at specific time-points during the care recipient's disease trajectory who are vulnerable to changes in their emotional and physical health. Improving caregivers' emotional and physical health may improve the delivery of care and quality of life for the care recipient.           n/a",Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers,7675325,R01CA118711,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Endocrine', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Face', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Functional disorder', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Rate', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Institutionalization', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Obligations', 'Stress', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'body-mind', 'burnout', 'care delivery', 'depressive symptoms', 'disease characteristic', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'longitudinal design', 'loved ones', 'meetings', 'mind body interaction', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'social']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2009,396835,0.009425789000274623
"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,7761795,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2009,447671,0.013777879165244996
"AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (01): Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention, and specific Challenge Topic 03-MH-101: Biomarkers in Mental Disorders. Clinically significant depressive symptoms have been reported in up to 86% of nursing home residents [Brodaty01], with substantial under-recognition of the problem and excess morbidity and mortality in individuals with dementia. The sensitivity of current depression detection approaches deteriorates notably with progressive cognitive impairment due to: (i) diminishing ability of demented subjects to communicate affective states, (ii) critical overlap between the neurovegetative symptoms of depression and the neuropsychiatric features of dementia (e.g., apathy), and (iii) the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms in the context of dementia [Bielinski06]. In order to improve the assessment of depression in dementia patients, the NIMH has proposed modifications to the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder that 1) highlight the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms, 2) addition of social withdrawal and irritability items, and 3) substitution of the anhedonia criterion with ""decreased positive affect or pleasure in response to social contact and usual activities"" [Olin02]. As the subject's ability to report internal affective states diminishes, however, activity and behavioral correlates of depression such as verbal and motor agitation, physical aggression, care resistance, and food/fluid refusal become important markers of possible depression [Bielinski06]. Emerging video, audio and sensor technologies hold promise for quantifying and automating the detection of such activities and behaviors, and thus identifying stages of depression that may be differentially responsive to various prevention and intervention strategies. We propose to overcome the under-diagnosis and failed recognition of symptoms of depression in dementia by applying real-time continuous video and audio recordings in the non-private spaces of a nursing home special care dementia unit (SCU; 16 total beds), as well as sensor recordings (radiofrequency identification tags, motion, contact and pressure sensors) throughout all the SCU spaces to capture the consenting subjects' activities, behaviors and social interaction patterns. Current ""gold standard"" research rating instruments will also be administered to record a detailed account of the cohort's clinical characteristics. The recordings will take place in three two-week waves that are each separated by 3 months. A frame-by-frame annotation of the video recordings by trained coders, as well as the pattern of sensor recordings, will provide training data for computer-based machine learning algorithms that will automate the detection of potential activity and behavioral manifestations to distinguish depressed from non-depressed nursing home residents with cognitive impairment or dementia.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.           Research Narrative The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.",AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA,7837153,RC1MH090021,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Food', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Nursing Homes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical aggression', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Social Interaction', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Video Recording', 'Withdrawal', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'depressed', 'depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'pleasure', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'radiofrequency', 'response', 'sensor', 'social']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,RC1,2009,493779,-0.0012250754271311917
"Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in hospital electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring technology, monitoring practices are inconsistent and often inadequate. We recently published new practice standards for ECG monitoring. The primary purpose of our proposed 5-year multisite randomized clinical trial, which is guided by the knowledge transfer framework, is to test the effect of implementing these standards on nurses' knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. We will also explore the sustainability of effects in the experimental group and the effect of the delayed intervention in the control group. We expect that increased knowledge and skills of nurses will lead to enhanced quality of care, which will result in improved outcomes for patients. Units serving cardiac patients in 16 hospitals will participate. Hospitals will be randomized to the experimental or control group after baseline measures of knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes are obtained. The intervention will include ECG monitoring education and strategies to implement and sustain change. The education will be Web-based and include 4 modules: essentials of ECG monitoring, arrhythmia monitoring, ischemia monitoring, and QT interval monitoring. The standardization of content, flexibility of use, immediate feedback in both practice and testing sections are advantages of Web-based education. The use of simulations to test skills makes our program innovative. The strategies to implement and sustain change in the clinical area include reinforcement of education, incentives, and the designation of  champions  on each unit who will actively promote the implementation of the practice standards. Statistical analyses will account for intra-cluster correlation at the hospital level. Most outcomes are categorical with 2 levels, whereas knowledge and skill scores are continuous. For categorical outcomes, two approaches will be considered: logistic regression models complemented with intra-cluster correlation using generalized estimating equations methods and extended Mantel-Haenszel cross-tabulation methods stratifying by cluster. For continuous outcomes, mixed modeling will be used to account for intra-cluster correlation through hierarchical linear models. We developed the new practice standards to improve hospital ECG monitoring. We expect that improved ECG monitoring will result in more accurate diagnosis and more timely treatment, which will lead to better outcomes for patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to test the effect of implementing new practice standards for electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring on nurses  knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. If implementation of the practice standards is associated with improvement in quality of care and patient outcomes, then there is the potential for improved care and outcomes for the literally millions of patients who require continuous ECG monitoring while hospitalized.          n/a",Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring,7620456,R01HL081642,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardioscopes', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Units', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Simulate', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular nursing', 'computerized', 'flexibility', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nursing skill', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,791582,0.021734089468340562
"Data Structuring and Visualization System for Neuro-oncology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The medical record for a neuro-oncology patient is complex, consisting of typically a large number of both text and imaging data. It includes descriptions of prior observations, interpretations, and interventions which need to be integrated into decisions regarding current patient care. An appropriate review of a patient's medical record often requires that a physician review multiple clinical documents while mentally noting issues related to what the findings were, the chronology of events, spatial/temporal patterns of disease progression, the effects of interventions, and the possible causal lines of explanation of observed findings. Additionally, imaging data and imaging- derived conclusions are poorly integrated into patient care and management decisions. The physician also needs to filter out those pieces of information not related to the current clinical context of care. Given the time constraints, data complexity and data volume associated with chronic patient cases, an appropriate review of a patient's chart is in reality rarely performed. Additionally, the lack of tools for formalizing the representation of the accounts of current and prior cases impedes the development of clinical databases that can be ultimately used to learn patterns of disease.       This proposal addresses the development of a system for facilitating the review of clinical patient data intended to promote an orderly process of medical problem understanding and care. The specific aims of the proposal are summarized as follows: 1) Development of a backend tool to facilitate the structured representation of observations, events, and inferences stated within medical reports. 2) Development of an application interface for visualizing, navigating, and editing structured patient data. 3) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the application in the domain of neuro-oncology.       Relation to public health. If the goals of this proposal can be realized, neuro-oncologist should be able to more easily seek desired patient data and detect patterns of evidence as compared to the current mode of operation (HIS, RIS, PACS). The structuring tools should lead to improvements in the quality of clinical research databases.           Narrative Medical records for neuro-oncology patients are difficult to review due to volume and complexity of information.

"Etiology, Epidemiology, and Clinical Outcomes of Health Care Associated Pneumonia    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) have periodically published guidelines on the diagnosis and management of pneumonia. In 2005, the ATS/IDSA published guidelines which define a new subset of pneumonia entitled Health Care Associated Pneumonia (HCAP). HCAP pertains to patients that have frequently interacted with the Health Care system prior to pneumonia, which is thought to increase risk for infections caused by multiple drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. The guidelines recommend aggressive diagnosis and antibiotic treatment regimens for HCAP. Research specific to HCAP is limited and the guideline recommendations have been questioned. Proposal Aims include: 1) to compare clinical outcome of patients with HCAP that receive standard community acquired pneumonia (CAP) therapy to those that receive alternative therapy such as guideline similar therapy (GTS)]; 2) identify risk factors for MDR bacteria including Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared to non-MDR bacteria and develop models that accurately identify patients infected with MDR. This will be a multi- center retrospective cohort study of Veterans Affairs Medical Center inpatients with HCAP. Propensity score matching will be used to adjust for potential confounding and selection bias associated with non-random treatment allocation. Generalized estimating equations will be used to characterize associations between 30-day survival and treatments: standard CAP; anti-MRSA and anti-Pseudomonas or GST, anti-MRSA, anti-Pseudomonas, or other therapies. In Aim 2 MDR status will be determined for all subjects. Logistic regression will be used to develop descriptive models of MDR risk based on non-HCAP specific risk criteria reported in the guidelines as well as HCAP specific data from the cohort. The process will be repeated for specific MDR pathogens: MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The best model of MDR status will be refitted with MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa data and compared to pathogen- specific derived models. The proposed study will determine whether adherence to HCAP guideline recommended treatments improve survival. Further developing specific prediction rules for MDR pathogens will refine future empirical HCAP antibiotic selection. Finally, determining which patients may benefit most from empirical MDR directed antibiotic therapy may help to limit antibiotic resistance. R&R: Other Project Materials 7. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Patients with exposure to the Health Care system resources are at increased risk for infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. The purpose of this study is to determine how frequently antibiotic resistant bacteria cause Health Care Associated pneumonia, what type of Health Care exposures are related to developing a pneumonia due to resistant bacteria, and what antibiotic treatment combinations work the best for Health Care Associated pneumonia. This study will improve public health by helping health care providers choose the right antibiotics when treating Health Care Associated pneumonia and not using more antibiotics than necessary.                n/a","Etiology, Epidemiology, and Clinical Outcomes of Health Care Associated Pneumonia",7532576,R03AI074894,"['Adherence', 'Alternative Therapies', 'American', 'Americas', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Cephalosporins', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Equation', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Macrolides', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Mono-S', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Other Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Pseudomonas', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Recommendation', 'Refit', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory System', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Score', 'Selection Bias', 'Societies', 'Sputum', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Survival Rate', 'Thinking', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'day', 'drug resistant bacteria', 'health care model', 'improved', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling']",NIAID,IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,61996,0.018590469752937745
"Clinical Features in Nursing Home Residents with Suspected UTI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common indication for prescribing antibiotics in nursing home residents. To date, criteria for surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment of UTI in nursing home residents have been derived by consensus rather than empirical data. Lack of criteria from empirical evidence leaves nursing home practitioners with the common clinical dilemma of deciding whether nonspecific clinical changes (e.g., fever, altered mental status) are attributable to UTI and whether treatment will benefit clinical outcome. A key step to identifying who should receive antibiotics is to empirically determine diagnostic criteria, including both clinical and laboratory features. The long-term OBJECTIVE of this line of investigation is to identify the subset of nursing home residents with laboratory evidence of UTI (i.e., bacteriuria plus pyuria) in which antibiotic therapy reduces adverse outcomes (i.e., bacteremia, functional decline, death). The SPECIFIC AIM of this proposed research is to identify clinical features that are associated with laboratory evidence of UTI (bacteriuria [>100,000 colony forming units on urine culture] plus pyuria [>10 white blood cells on urinalysis]). Our a priori HYPOTHESIS is that specific clinical features (i.e., change in mental status, fever, change in voiding pattern) will be associated with laboratory evidence of UTI. This observational cohort study will be conducted at five New Haven area nursing homes with a sample size estimate of 493 residents. Persons aged 65 years or older will undergo baseline assessment upon enrollment and repeat assessment when suspected of having UTI. A logistic regression model will be used to determine bivariate and multivariable associations between clinical features and laboratory evidence of UTI. A ROC curve will be calculated from the final multivariable logistic regression model. Those clinical features independently associated with laboratory evidence of UTI will be combined with bacteriuria and pyuria to create an evidence-based definition of UTI. Identifying clinically relevant UTI in nursing home residents is a common dilemma with important functional, economic, and infection control implications. This study will create an evidence-based definition of UTI.

Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,7510774,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic Diseases', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Rural Community', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2008,94531,0.006245088590132478
"Assessing an Adolescent Violence Screening Tool Longitudinally for Primary Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K award will be integral in the development of Dr. Sigel's career, which is focused on youth violence detection and intervention in the primary care setting. Dr. Sigel will work with the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence, under the primary mentorship of Dr. Terence Thornberry. To become an independent researcher in this field, the candidate has identified several skill sets that need enhancement, including: improving knowledge of psychometric properties of screening tools, improving ability to conduct longitudinal, randomized control intervention trials, learning skills to evaluate program implementation, increasing understanding of what interventions work for youth violence intervention, and understanding the interface between violence as a public health problem and how the medical setting can be used to address this issue. A combination of working at the CSPV, taking didactic classes, interfacing with the community, and carrying out the proposed research project will accomplish this. Long term career goals include: 1) becoming an independent clinical investigator in the field of youth violence assessment and intervention; 2) studying and implementing evidence-based interventions at the primary care level to decrease morbidity and mortality from youth violence and 3) establishing a center of excellence in youth violence assessment and treatment, in collaboration with community partners. The research project is: Assessing Predictive Validity at 1 and 2 Years of the Violence Injury, Protection and Risk Screening Tool for Primary Care. Specific Aim: Determine the predictive validity at one and two years of the Violence Injury, Protection and Risk Screening (VIPRS) Tool that identifies youth at risk for future violence involvement (aggression, violence perpetration, violence victimization, and injury from violence).Methods: An initial cohort of 165 youth, and 131 parents have been enrolled to evaluate the reliability and validity of the VIPRS cross-sectionally. This proposed study will examine the future predictive validity of the VIPRS by assessing the initial cohort of youth and parents at one and two year follow-up from initial enrollment. Questionnaires evaluating aggression and victimization will be administered, as well as repeating the VIPRS. Chart review will be done at one and two year follow-up to determine whether the primary care practitioner diagnosed any behavior related to violence involvement, or any violence related injury. Analysis The predictive validity of the VIPRS will be examined using multivariate linear or logistic regression analysis to determine whether:1) the VIPRS baseline scores are associated with violent behavior occurring between baseline and the one-year and two year follow-up interview; and 2) change in VIPRS scores from baseline to one-year is associated with violent behavior occurring between the one-year follow-up interview and the two-year follow-up interviews, adjusted for baseline VIPRS scores. Project Narrative/Relevance: This project is vital to the public health issue of youth violence. Primary care health professionals have not been actively involved in treating youth violence, mostly because it is time consuming and challenging to recognize youth at risk. By creating an easy to administer screening tool, health professionals will be able to recognize, and ultimately intervene before youth suffer the consequences of violence involvement.           n/a",Assessing an Adolescent Violence Screening Tool Longitudinally for Primary Care,7497414,K01CE001332,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K01,2008,149201,-0.009665285689804017
"Brief Intervention in the ER in Poland    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aims of this Developmental Grant Proposal for Collaborative International Projects are to: 1) examine the effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) using a nurse-delivered motivational intervention, relative to standard care with and without assessment, on a reduction in heavy drinking (drinking days per week, number of drinks per day, maximum number of drinks on an occasion) and alcohol-related problems (RAPS4 and SIPS + 6) in the emergency room (ER) in Sosnowiec, Poland; and, 2) identify variables that are related to effectiveness of the intervention and that predict successful treatment outcome. We plan to translate motivational interventions that have been successful in primary care and which were recently implemented in the U.S. 14 Academic Emergency Medicine SBIRT study to a non-academic ER setting outside of the U.S. The SBIRT study, recently funded by NIAAA and SAMHSA, is the first multisite, collaborative study of screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ER. We will conduct a blinded randomized brief motivational intervention trial in which both injured and noninjured patients over the aged of 18 will be screened for at-risk or dependent (using the RAPS4) drinking. Those screening positive will be asked to participate in the study. Consenting patients will be randomized into one of three groups: screened only, assessed, and brief intervention, with n=292 in each group. Intervention and assessment groups will be followed-up at 3 months and all three groups at 12 months.      Modifying variables include drinking in the event, risk taking disposition and readiness and stage of change. Prior research in the ER in Sosnowiec and a pilot feasibility study of SBIRT in Sosnowiec suggest: 1) a large number of ""at risk"", heavy problem and dependent drinkers who meet screening criteria for brief intervention in a relatively short period of time; 2) a socialized health care system which provides equal access to care and is not subject to selection bias affecting patient access; 3) a patient sample covering a large geographic area; 4) a stable environment facilitating high follow-up rates post-intervention; and, 5) a well integrated referral system and high accessibility to alcohol treatment services. Outcome data will be analyzed using ANOVA, logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations. The interaction of modifying variables on outcomes will also be analyzed. The ER is an important setting for screening and brief intervention for those with alcohol-related problems in order to reduce subsequent alcohol-related ER visits and associated costs and increase quality of life. This project will inform the development and spread of more effective techniques and protocols for addressing at-risk and dependent drinking in the ER, and provide a better understanding of those factors that influence effectiveness of brief intervention and predict successful patient outcomes.          n/a",Brief Intervention in the ER in Poland,7371147,R21AA016081,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcohols', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Cities', 'Consent', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Cultural Characteristics', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease regression', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Esthesia', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Geographic Locations', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human Resources', 'Impulsivity', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neuro-Oncological Ventral Antigen 2', 'Numbers', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Poland', 'Policies', 'Polishes', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Readiness', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Selection Bias', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Substance of Abuse', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Visit', 'Week', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'care seeking', 'cost', 'day', 'drinking', 'early /brief intervention /therapy', 'follow-up', 'injured', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'motivational intervention', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'social', 'trauma centers', 'willingness']",NIAAA,PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE,R21,2008,166229,-0.04478334497400856
"Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders Dr. Deborah Ann Hall is applying for a mentored patient-oriented research (K23) award in the area of movement disorders. This proposal describes a research and training program for the development of a clinician-investigator in neurology. The principal investigator, Dr. Hall, has completed neurology residency  raining and a movement disorders fellowship. She received a competitive clinical research fellowship from the American Academy of Neurology and is pursuing a Ph.D. in Clinical Science. The candidate's immediate goals are to continue research in the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, by directly applying her newly acquired epidemiologic and biostatistics skills in the proposed project. Her long term goals are to study the genetic risk factors, neuroepidemiology, and treatment of ataxia, including sporadic ataxia. During the award period, Dr. Hall will be based in the Department of Neurology at the University of Colorado (UCDHSC). UCDHSC has an extensive track record for supporting and developing clinician-investigators. The Ph.D. in Clinical Sciences program at UCDHSC facilitates mentored multidisciplinary clinical research. The candidate will carry out her research with Professors Tim Byers MD (Epidemiology), Maureen Leehey MD (Neurology), Gary Zerbe PhD (Biostatistics), and Paul Hagerman MD PhD (Biological Chemistry). Dr. Hall's research program is to determine the prevalence of repeat expansions in the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation) gene in subjects with tremor, ataxia, and/or parkinsonism. Dr. Hall will do a cross- sectional study by recruiting subjects in her clinics with the three phenotypes and performing PCR of the FMR1 gene. All subjects eligible will be recruited and the genetic testing will be done in a research laboratory. The primary outcomes to be measured are the prevalence of repeat expansions in the three groups combined and each phenotypic subgroup. The age of onset, age of diagnosis of neurological signs, and correlations between trinucleotide repeat size and phenotype are also outcomes to be measured. Linear and logistic regression models will be used and covariates including race and ethnicity will be studied. Relevance: This study is important because it may define genetic risk factors for various abnormal movements, such as tremor. This will result in improved diagnosis and potentially treatment of individuals with progressive neurological diseases. These illnesses represent an important public health problem as they cause morbidity and mortality in our aging population. n/a",Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders,7413272,K23NS052487,"['Academy', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Award', 'Biochemistry', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Colorado', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'FMR1', 'FMR1 Gene', 'FMR1 Premutation', 'FMR1 repeat expansion', 'FXTAS', 'Fellowship', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Gait abnormality', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intention Tremor', 'Laboratory Research', 'Length', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentored Clinical Oncology Award', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Award', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Rain', 'Range', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Subgroup', 'Training Programs', 'Tremor', 'Trinucleotide Repeats', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'disability', 'genetic risk factor', 'improved', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'programs', 'size', 'skills']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2008,173340,-0.01840652638208407
"Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant continues to be associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Fifteen to 50% of patients die from complications related to the procedure. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affects 20-80% of transplant recipients and is the major cause of post transplant non-relapse mortality. While some clinical parameters (e.g. age, donor: recipient histocompatibility) can predict GVHD, no biological factors have been identified that reliably predict the incidence and severity of GVHD and its associated mortality, as well as allow an understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of the disease, which, in turn could inform innovative treatment approaches. Hence, there exists a critical need to identify reliable biomarkers for the disease. We hypothesize that polymorphisms in genes regulating biological pathways of GVHD are associated with GVHD and transplant related mortality (TRM). We propose a candidate gene approach to analyze, in 838 subjects (donors and recipients), the relationship of 427 genetic polymorphisms which may modulate the immune response, inflammatory amplification and the metabolism of therapeutic agents with the incidence and course of GVHD and transplant related mortality. We will use conventional multiple variable regression analysis to identify relevant polymorphisms and will test novel machine based learning and graph based algorithms to identify gene patterns or interactions not recognizable with usual statistical techniques. Reliable genetic biomarkers would permit identification of high risk patients who need more effective prophylaxis or preemptive screening or therapeutic interventions to limit the severity of their graft versus host disease and ultimately to improve survival. Validation of our findings in a subsequent multicenter cohort could provide important data useful to inform the management of allograft patients and improve their outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Graft-versus-host disease is a devastating disease that affects 20-70% of blood and marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. The disease is caused by an immune attack by donor cells on patient tissue. Some genetic factors, including polymorphisms (changes in amino acids in genes that alter their function) may predict patients at high risk of these complications. We aim to identify patients at high risk of complications and death, and subsequently modify their treatment, using the information we learn from our genetic studies, to alter their course. Our long term goal is to improve survival in these patients by determining groups at high risk towards whom intensive therapy should be targeted.          n/a",Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve,7509654,R21AI079354,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Graft Versus Host Disease', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allogenic', 'Allografting', 'Amino Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Transplants', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cytokine Gene', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rare Diseases', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'chronic graft versus host disease', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug metabolism', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'graft vs host disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2008,188750,-0.02649763783238876
"Predictors of Hospital-Acquired Urinary Tract-Related Bloodstream Infection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preventive efforts to reduce urinary tract-related bloodstream infection are hampered by the scarcity of analytic studies that identify etiologic factors, particularly those specific to the time-dependent elements that may impact prognosis during hospitalization. Therefore, the ability of clinicians to intercede in a meaningful way has been restricted. The objective of this study is to delineate both host- and time-dependent factors that contribute to urinary tract-related bloodstream infection in hospitalized patients. This study is unique in that it will ascertain potential causal mechanisms of bloodstream infection taking into account the time course of a hospitalized patient's stay and the multiple procedures and treatments that occur during this stay. Specific Aim #1 addresses the relation between obesity, diabetes, and urosepsis. Specific Aim #2 is directed to time-related procedural and treatment factors that impact the incidence of infection. Of particular interest are the use of catheterization, ultrasound detection of urinary retention, antibiotics, immunosuppressant therapies, statin use, and allogeneic blood transfusions. A nested case-control study is planned that will include adult patients from the University of Michigan Health System. Incidence density sampling will be utilized for random selection of controls. Information from cases and controls will be extracted from multiple electronic databases (electronic medical, pharmacy, and laboratory records) over a 5-year period to yield 640 subjects. Analyses will identify factors related to the development of urinary tract-related bloodstream infection in hospitalized patients. Conditional logistic regression with clustering by ward will be utilized for the analyses, as well as sliding time windows for log-linear models and cubic B-splines with time-specific weight functions. We anticipate that the information obtained from the proposed study   which evaluates novel risk factors and is responsive to program announcement PA-06-151 by utilizing secondary data   will enhance tools for clinical decision making and provide a framework for preventive trials. Urinary tract infection is the most frequent healthcare-associated infection and, when disseminated to the bloodstream, can be fatal. The mortality rate of urinary tract-related bloodstream infection varies from 5% to 33% in different cohorts and is considerably higher in elderly patients. We anticipate that the information obtained from this study will form the foundation for the development of screening tests to identify patients at risk of infection at specific points in time during hospitalization and for planning preventive intervention trials.

"Biomarker panel to differentiate stroke from stroke mimic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States (US), stroke affects more than 700,000 people annually in the U.S. and is the third leading cause of death. Stroke patients may present to the emergency room with a wide variety of symptoms that can be caused by other conditions not related to stroke, collectively called stroke mimic. Even at the most advanced stroke centers, the diagnosis of ischemic stroke is made by clinical examination after ruling out hemorrhagic lesions by imaging. These imaging tests can be used to diagnose hemorrhagic stroke but is relatively ineffective in detecting most ischemic stroke. A reliable and rapid method to distinguish stroke and stroke mimic is a necessary aid to current examination and imaging-based stroke diagnosis and will become more crucial with the implementation of new therapies for the time-critical treatment of ischemic stroke. In contrast to cardiovascular disease and oncology, no approved immunoassay or molecular test is available to aid diagnosis. Analysis of a previous dataset demonstrated that our advanced GeneRx algorithm technologies were able to develop an accurate diagnostic model where other multi-marker panels failed. In this phase I proposal we will perform a validation study, collecting blood samples from 200 admitted with stroke-like symptoms and diagnosed as stroke or stroke mimic. We will measure stroke biomarker protein levels markers present in the top combinations and algorithms from our previous study, and utilize our proprietary GeneRx technology to develop a multiple marker predictive model for accurate differentiation of stroke from stroke mimic. Project Narrative: Currently no blood test is available to help accurately diagnose stroke patients. This study develops a diagnostic to help differentiate stroke patients from the many non-stroke patients that arrive at the ER with stroke-like symptoms. Successful development of this diagnostic will increase the effectiveness and speed of stroke treatment to increase a patient's chances of improvement and safety of treatment.          n/a",Biomarker panel to differentiate stroke from stroke mimic,7405215,R43NS061455,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alteplase', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coagulation Process', 'Condition', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunoassay', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'social', 'statistics', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"PREDICTION SCIENCES, LLC",R43,2008,252533,0.016560139249946475
"The Effectiveness of Smoking Cessation Guidelines in the Emergency Department    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although 78% of smokers report that a health professional has previously advised them to quit smoking, most smokers are not advised to stop smoking or offered assistance with smoking cessation during a given ED visit. There are multiple barriers to routine implementation of smoking cessation guidelines by emergency clinicians, however, and rigorously performed clinical trials are needed to demonstrate that routine screening and counseling of ED patients results in increased quit rates. To determine the feasibility of implementing the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Smoking Cessation Guideline in the ED, we will conduct a clinical trial in 974 ambulatory adult smokers who present to 2 emergency departments, using a pre-post design. During the 3-month baseline period, clinicians will perform their usual duties but will not receive training in use of the AHRQ Guideline. Based on the Chronic Care Model, the 3-month intervention period will include: 1) a tutorial on brief cessation counseling for ED nurses and physicians, 2) use of an ED algorithm that includes recommended tobacco counseling items, 3) fax referral of motivated smokers to the Iowa Quitline for proactive telephone counseling plus free nicotine replacement therapy, and 4) group and individual feedback to ED staff. We will conduct exit interviews of ED patients to assess performance of guideline-recommended actions by ED staff and 3- and 6-month telephone follow-up to determine 7-day point-prevalence abstinence (with biochemical confirmation of self-reported quitters at 6 months). Our main analyses will examine the contrast between the intervention and control periods in the performance of guideline- recommended actions and in 6-month quit rates, using hierarchical logistic regression to adjust for baseline differences in potentially confounding patient variables.

"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persons with a primary malignant brain tumor (PMBT) often suffer significant functional and neurologic morbidity causing family caregivers to assume the care recipient's familial, social, and financial obligations. Research has shown that caregivers of persons with other chronic diseases develop negative consequences as a result of providing care. Despite high morbidity (and mortality) rates for persons with a PMBT, caregiver issues in neuro-oncology have been virtually ignored. In response to PA-05-027, the purposes of this study are to use a multidisciplinary, integrative model, the Pittsburgh Mind Body Center Model, to (1) examine the psycho-behavioral responses (i.e. depressive symptoms and sleep), biologic responses (i.e. blood pressure and ihterleukins) and overall physical health of family members of persons with a PMBT at the time of diagnosis, and (2) to describe how relationships within the model vary over time in response to changes in the care recipient's illness trajectory as the family member transitions to a family caregiver. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) examine how care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho- behavioral responses, biologic responses, and overall physical health change over time (from PBMT diagnosis to 12 months after diagnosis); and during this 12-month period, to 2) examine how caregivers' personal characteristics moderate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho-behavioral responses; 3) examine how caregiver psycho-behavioral responses mediate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' biologic responses; and 4) examine how caregivers' biologic responses mediate the relationship between their psycho-behavioral responses and overall physical health. A descriptive longitudinal design will be used to collect data to address the aims of the project. Linear and logistic regression analysis will be used to model baseline responses. Repeated measures analysis (random coefficients modeling) will be used to examine change over time and latent growth curve modeling will be used to further explore longitudinal data. The relevance of the project to public health is to identify caregivers at specific time-points during the care recipient's disease trajectory who are vulnerable to changes in their emotional and physical health. Improving caregivers' emotional and physical health may improve the delivery of care and quality of life for the care recipient.           n/a",Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers,7496605,R01CA118711,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Endocrine', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Face', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Functional disorder', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Rate', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Institutionalization', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Love', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Rate', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Obligations', 'Stress', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'body-mind', 'care delivery', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disease characteristic', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'mind body interaction', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'social']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2008,393213,0.009425789000274623
"Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in hospital electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring technology, monitoring practices are inconsistent and often inadequate. We recently published new practice standards for ECG monitoring. The primary purpose of our proposed 5-year multisite randomized clinical trial, which is guided by the knowledge transfer framework, is to test the effect of implementing these standards on nurses' knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. We will also explore the sustainability of effects in the experimental group and the effect of the delayed intervention in the control group. We expect that increased knowledge and skills of nurses will lead to enhanced quality of care, which will result in improved outcomes for patients. Units serving cardiac patients in 16 hospitals will participate. Hospitals will be randomized to the experimental or control group after baseline measures of knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes are obtained. The intervention will include ECG monitoring education and strategies to implement and sustain change. The education will be Web-based and include 4 modules: essentials of ECG monitoring, arrhythmia monitoring, ischemia monitoring, and QT interval monitoring. The standardization of content, flexibility of use, immediate feedback in both practice and testing sections are advantages of Web-based education. The use of simulations to test skills makes our program innovative. The strategies to implement and sustain change in the clinical area include reinforcement of education, incentives, and the designation of  champions  on each unit who will actively promote the implementation of the practice standards. Statistical analyses will account for intra-cluster correlation at the hospital level. Most outcomes are categorical with 2 levels, whereas knowledge and skill scores are continuous. For categorical outcomes, two approaches will be considered: logistic regression models complemented with intra-cluster correlation using generalized estimating equations methods and extended Mantel-Haenszel cross-tabulation methods stratifying by cluster. For continuous outcomes, mixed modeling will be used to account for intra-cluster correlation through hierarchical linear models. We developed the new practice standards to improve hospital ECG monitoring. We expect that improved ECG monitoring will result in more accurate diagnosis and more timely treatment, which will lead to better outcomes for patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to test the effect of implementing new practice standards for electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring on nurses  knowledge and skills, quality of care, and patient outcomes. If implementation of the practice standards is associated with improvement in quality of care and patient outcomes, then there is the potential for improved care and outcomes for the literally millions of patients who require continuous ECG monitoring while hospitalized.          n/a",Implementation of Practice Standards for ECG Monitoring,7461372,R01HL081642,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardioscopes', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Units', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pliability', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Pulse taking', 'Purpose', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Score', 'Simulate', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular nursing', 'computerized', 'day', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nursing skill', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,823164,0.021734089468340562
"Clinical Features in Nursing Home Residents with Suspected UTI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common indication for prescribing antibiotics in nursing home residents. To date, criteria for surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment of UTI in nursing home residents have been derived by consensus rather than empirical data. Lack of criteria from empirical evidence leaves nursing home practitioners with the common clinical dilemma of deciding whether nonspecific clinical changes (e.g., fever, altered mental status) are attributable to UTI and whether treatment will benefit clinical outcome. A key step to identifying who should receive antibiotics is to empirically determine diagnostic criteria, including both clinical and laboratory features. The long-term OBJECTIVE of this line of investigation is to identify the subset of nursing home residents with laboratory evidence of UTI (i.e., bacteriuria plus pyuria) in which antibiotic therapy reduces adverse outcomes (i.e., bacteremia, functional decline, death). The SPECIFIC AIM of this proposed research is to identify clinical features that are associated with laboratory evidence of UTI (bacteriuria [>100,000 colony forming units on urine culture] plus pyuria [>10 white blood cells on urinalysis]). Our a priori HYPOTHESIS is that specific clinical features (i.e., change in mental status, fever, change in voiding pattern) will be associated with laboratory evidence of UTI. This observational cohort study will be conducted at five New Haven area nursing homes with a sample size estimate of 493 residents. Persons aged 65 years or older will undergo baseline assessment upon enrollment and repeat assessment when suspected of having UTI. A logistic regression model will be used to determine bivariate and multivariable associations between clinical features and laboratory evidence of UTI. A ROC curve will be calculated from the final multivariable logistic regression model. Those clinical features independently associated with laboratory evidence of UTI will be combined with bacteriuria and pyuria to create an evidence-based definition of UTI. Identifying clinically relevant UTI in nursing home residents is a common dilemma with important functional, economic, and infection control implications. This study will create an evidence-based definition of UTI. Future studies will identify residents with UTI in whom antibiotic therapy improves clinical outcome.           n/a",Clinical Features in Nursing Home Residents with Suspected UTI,7201957,R03AG028057,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Age', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic-resistant organism', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriuria', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colony-forming units', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysuria', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Fever', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'High Prevalence', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Leukocytes', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Publishing', 'Pyuria', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Renal Hypertension', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Urinalysis', 'Urinary tract', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urination', 'Urine', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'day', 'experience', 'functional decline', 'improved', 'mortality', 'young adult']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2007,67650,0.0004858687600093358
"Utility of Trans Telephonic Monitoring in the Detection of Silent Arrhythmias    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this feasibility study is to determine if a Cardiac Arrhythmia Trans telephonic EKG monitoring system (CAT) can be used to detect asymptomatic or ""silent"" arrhythmias in patients greater than or equal to 65 years of age with a history of hypertension (HTN) and heart failure (HF) and characterize their onset, frequency, and duration. The secondary aim is to examine the association between silent arrhythmias and quality of life (QoL). Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and its prevalence increases with age, HTN, and HF. It also has a profound impact on QoL. Whether silent or symptomatic, AF can result in stroke. Detection of silent arrhythmias, especially silent AF, could prompt the initiation of anticoagulation that would decrease the occurrence of stroke, which is the third leading cause of death in the US. As treatment for HTN and HF continue to improve, combined with increased life expectancy, early arrhythmia identification strategies are urgently needed to predict who is at the highest risk for silent arrhythmias. Standard methods for detecting AF include 12-lead EKGs, 24-hour Holter recorders (HM) and non-auto-triggered memory loop recorders (MLR). MLRs are unable to automatically detect and capture silent arrhythmias since they require patient activation during symptoms. Auto-triggered MLRs (AT-MLR) have recently become available which automatically record arrhythmias, with or without associated symptoms, and the stored EKG data can then be transmitted trans telephonically (via phone) to a central monitoring station. A recently completed retrospective analysis has shown that AT-MLRs produced a higher yield of diagnostic events and an earlier time to diagnosis of silent arrhythmias as compared to HM or MLR. This study proposes a single-center, prospective consecutive series of 100 patients using a 14-day CAT monitoring period. At baseline and 6 months, cardiac clinical characteristics and risk factors will be collected from patients via physical exam and chart review, and the SF-36v2(TM) will be administered to determine if differences exist in perceived QoL in patients with silent AF. Information regarding AF frequency and duration will be quantified using the University of Toronto Atrial Fibrillation Scale (AFSS). Spearman's correlation will be used to assess the association between AF and changes in SF-36v2(TM) QoL scores between baseline and 6 months. The relationship between AF, demographic, and clinical characteristics will be determined using logistic regression analysis. All significant univariate variables will be entered into a multivariate logistic regression model. The results of this feasibility study could potentially justify development of a new screening mechanism for silent AF. If this study proves successful, a larger trial will be proposed to explore specific clinical variables, EKG characteristics, and treatment strategies to improve clinical care and QoL.           n/a",Utility of Trans Telephonic Monitoring in the Detection of Silent Arrhythmias,7244448,R03NR010001,"['Age', 'Age-Years', 'Anticoagulation', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benign', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dizziness', 'Ectopic beats', 'Elderly', 'Electric Countershock', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Longevity', 'Mechanics', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Palpitations', 'Patients', 'Perceived quality of life', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Purpose', 'Quality of life', 'Rate', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Shock', 'Sinus', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Unconscious State', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'clinically significant', 'compare effectiveness', 'day', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'heart rhythm', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'older patient', 'prospective']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2007,78166,0.022847480109990964
"Serum Vitamin D and Mortality from Eye Melanoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uveal ('eye') melanomas are aggressive neoplasms that evolve in the choroidal tissues of the inner eye. The goal of this research is to examine whether serum levels of vitamin D, a 'nutrient' derived from sun exposure, is a prognostic factor in melanoma of the eye. The hormonally active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol), is a well-known potent regulator of cell growth and differentiation in cells and tissues expressing the vitamin D receptor (VDR), and there is recent evidence of an inhibiting effect on tumor invasion and metastasis. However, only limited data are available from human studies. The proposed investigation will be based on a large series of eye melanoma patients treated over a 13 year period (1992-2004) at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, in Boston, a leading referral center for diagnosis and treatment of these tumors. Blood samples were collected at the time of diagnosis and serum and buffy coat fractions were stored at -70C. In the planned study, vital status of the patients will be updated on all surviving patients by chart review and a search of the Social Security, and National Death Indexes. Of 1,493 patients with stored sera and DNA, an estimated 272 deaths from tumor causes (the 'cases') will be identified (median follow up: 8.7 years). For each case, one matched control will be selected, similar to the case on clinical prognostic factors and year of diagnosis, and alive and free of metastasis. Serum samples will be tested for levels of calcidiol (25(OH)D3), the depot for biosynthesis of active vitamin D. Case-control comparisons for vitamin levels will be performed using conditional logistic regression. Specific genotypes and haplotypes in the VDR will also be examined for relationships to melanoma outcome, and interactions with serum vitamin D levels will be explored. To our knowledge, this will be the first investigation of its kind, based on a unique resource of prospectively collected serum and DNA, and long-term patient follow up. The proposed study will provide new information on the relationship of vitamin D to mortality from eye melanoma. Because vitamin D is believed to have multiple inhibitory actions in cancer metastasis, the data may be applicable to other cancer sites. If the proposed hypotheses are supported, findings may offer novel insights, and point to new strategies for cancer control.           n/a",Serum Vitamin D and Mortality from Eye Melanoma,7255468,R03CA119751,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anabolism', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Boston', 'Calcifediol', 'Calcitriol', 'Calendar', 'Cancer Control', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Choroid', 'Ciliary Body', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Death Records', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Epidemiology', 'Excision', 'Eye', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hair', 'Haplotypes', 'Investigation', 'Iris', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Melanins', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'National Security', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms', 'Non-Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Ocular Melanoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pigments', 'Play', 'Production', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Social Security', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Staging', 'Sun Exposure', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Update', 'Uveal Melanoma', 'Vision', 'Vital Status', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D Deficiency', 'Vitamin D3 Receptor', 'Vitamins', 'base', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer site', 'case control', 'cell growth', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'human study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'malignant neoplasm of eye', 'melanocyte', 'melanoma', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'programs', 'size', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,H.

"SPIMA: Signal Processing for Individualized Mood Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SPIMA: Signal Processing for Individual Mood Assessment The phase I objective of SPIMA is to create a phone-based system that longitudinally and remotely assesses the mood of patients suffering from major depression. The ultimate objective of this SBIR is to automate the assessment of depression and deliver that automated assessment remotely over telecommunications or internet infrastructure. The value of the system is for patients and providers to have an unobtrusive way to gain greater insight into the progression of depression, and potential response to therapy. The core technology is the SPIMA index that is calculated based on performing signal processing of voice acoustics and will correlate to standard clinical depression rating scales. The phase I will begin with a first user study to give use case scenarios on the design of SPIMA and collect 150 voice samples from 30 subjects. The voice algorithms will be tested for reliability on these diverse voice samples. Through a second study of fifteen depressed patients over eight weeks, the SPIMA index will be validated. The objective of that study will be to establish the overall feasibility of SPIMA to predict a patient's mood and response to medical therapy over time. In the phase II study, SPIMA will be validated with a larger patient population through a phase IV clinical trial. It will also be applied to run off a mobile phone as a step towards more continuous mood monitoring. The project is significant as it can provide a new means to manage this chronic and debilitating disease. SPIMA: Signal Processing for Individual Mood Assessment SPIMA will make a significant impact on public health by providing a simple and elegant way to monitor depression through voice analysis. The SPIMA index will become an important longitudinal measure of a patient's mood that will be closely related to established depression rating scales.

"Assessing an Adolescent Violence Screening Tool Longitudinally for Primary Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K award will be integral in the development of Dr. Sigel's career, which is focused on youth violence detection and intervention in the primary care setting. Dr. Sigel will work with the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence, under the primary mentorship of Dr. Terence Thornberry. To become an independent researcher in this field, the candidate has identified several skill sets that need enhancement, including: improving knowledge of psychometric properties of screening tools, improving ability to conduct longitudinal, randomized control intervention trials, learning skills to evaluate program implementation, increasing understanding of what interventions work for youth violence intervention, and understanding the interface between violence as a public health problem and how the medical setting can be used to address this issue. A combination of working at the CSPV, taking didactic classes, interfacing with the community, and carrying out the proposed research project will accomplish this. Long term career goals include: 1) becoming an independent clinical investigator in the field of youth violence assessment and intervention; 2) studying and implementing evidence-based interventions at the primary care level to decrease morbidity and mortality from youth violence and 3) establishing a center of excellence in youth violence assessment and treatment, in collaboration with community partners. The research project is: Assessing Predictive Validity at 1 and 2 Years of the Violence Injury, Protection and Risk Screening Tool for Primary Care. Specific Aim: Determine the predictive validity at one and two years of the Violence Injury, Protection and Risk Screening (VIPRS) Tool that identifies youth at risk for future violence involvement (aggression, violence perpetration, violence victimization, and injury from violence).Methods: An initial cohort of 165 youth, and 131 parents have been enrolled to evaluate the reliability and validity of the VIPRS cross-sectionally. This proposed study will examine the future predictive validity of the VIPRS by assessing the initial cohort of youth and parents at one and two year follow-up from initial enrollment. Questionnaires evaluating aggression and victimization will be administered, as well as repeating the VIPRS. Chart review will be done at one and two year follow-up to determine whether the primary care practitioner diagnosed any behavior related to violence involvement, or any violence related injury. Analysis The predictive validity of the VIPRS will be examined using multivariate linear or logistic regression analysis to determine whether:1) the VIPRS baseline scores are associated with violent behavior occurring between baseline and the one-year and two year follow-up interview; and 2) change in VIPRS scores from baseline to one-year is associated with violent behavior occurring between the one-year follow-up interview and the two-year follow-up interviews, adjusted for baseline VIPRS scores. Project Narrative/Relevance: This project is vital to the public health issue of youth violence. Primary care health professionals have not been actively involved in treating youth violence, mostly because it is time consuming and challenging to recognize youth at risk. By creating an easy to administer screening tool, health professionals will be able to recognize, and ultimately intervene before youth suffer the consequences of violence involvement.           n/a",Assessing an Adolescent Violence Screening Tool Longitudinally for Primary Care,7394227,K01CE001332,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K01,2007,148359,-0.009665285689804017
"Rett syndrome: determinants of outcome and burden DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This population-based study will follow the current cohort of live (n=225) cases with Rett syndrome in Australia for a further five years. New cases ascertained during the study period will also be included. It will describe the natural history of Rett syndrome and assess its impact on resource utilization and the economic and social burden on families and community in comparison with Down syndrome and a normal comparison group. Baseline data on communication, mobility, symptoms and classification have been gathered on the cohort since 1993. In 2000 data were collected on functional ability in daily living, behavior, hand function, medical conditions, and use of health and education services. Mutation data, collected on 80 percent of cases will be continued. A questionnaire has been developed, piloted and will be used to collect data on function, health and well-being of the Rett syndrome subjects and family in 2002, 2004 and 2006. Data will be gathered for the Down syndrome comparison group in 2003. Participants will respond via paper-based or through secure on-line formats. Optical scanning or on-line data capture will be used for data entry. In 2003 and 2005 clinical assessments or clinical file review will provide EEG, ECG, blood parameters, bone densitometry and autonomic nervous system data. A video protocol developed in 2001 to record functional ability will be extended to include gross motor and oral motor function, hand apraxia, gait assessment and language function. Serial videos collected in 2003 and again in 2005 will enable us to monitor changes over time and the effect of therapy or surgery. Yearly telephone interviews to families will record anthropometric data, current medication usage and update previously collected family tree data. Every two years a validated questionnaire to identify epilepsy type will be included. Resource data to determine the direct, indirect and opportunity costs associated with Rett syndrome will be compared with a normal and Down syndrome comparison group. Data analysis will use multiple regression models to examine effects of different variables on child and family level outcomes and discriminant analysis, recursive partitioning and machine learning to identify genotype/phenotype associations at the individual child level. Feedback to families on study progress will be given through the study Web site. n/a",Rett syndrome: determinants of outcome and burden,7246596,R01HD043100,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Australia', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Condition', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Densitometry', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease regression', 'Down Syndrome', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epilepsy', 'Family', 'Family Characteristics', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gait Apraxia', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genealogical Tree', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Hand functions', 'Health', 'Health education', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Mutation', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Resources', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Social Class', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Update', 'Woman', 'X Inactivation', 'aged', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disability burden', 'feeding', 'mortality', 'opportunity cost', 'oral motor', 'prognostic', 'scoliosis', 'social']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA,R01,2007,161286,-0.007042297138886422
"Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Deborah Ann Hall is applying for a Pentored Patient-Oriented Research (K23) Award in the area of movement disorders. This proposal describes a research and training program for the development of a clinician-investigator in neurology. The principal investigator, Dr. Hall, has completed neurology residency training and a movement disorders fellowship. She received a competitive clinical research fellowship from the American Academy of Neurology and is pursuing a Ph.D. in Clinical Science. The candidate's immediate goals are to continue research in the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, by directly applying her newly acquired epidemiologic and biostatistics skills in the proposed project. Her long term goals are to study the genetic risk factors, neuroepidemiology and treatment of ataxia, including sporadic ataxia. During the award period, Dr. Hall will be based in the Department of Neurology at the University of Colorado (UCDHSC). UCDHSC has an extensive track record for supporting and developing clinician-investigators. The Ph.D. in Clinical Sciences program at UCDHSC facilitates mentored multidisciplinary clinical research. The candidate will carry out her research with Professors Tim Byers MD (Epidemiology), Maureen Leehey MD (Neurology), Gary Zerbe PhD (Biostatistics), and Paul Hagerman MD PhD (Biological Chemistry). Dr. Hall's research program is to determine the prevalence of repeat expansions in the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation) gene in subjects with tremor, ataxia and/or parkinsonism. Dr. Hall will do a cross-sectional study by recruiting subjects in her clinics with the three phenotypes and performing PCR of the FMR1 gene. All subjects eligible will be recruited and the genetic testing will be done in a research laboratory. The primary outcomes to be measured are the prevalence of repeat expansions in the three groups combined and each phenotypic subgroup. The age of onset, age of diagnosis of neurological signs and correlations between tri-nucleotide repeat size and phenotype are also outcomes to be measured. Linear and logistic regression models will be used and covariates including race and ethnicity will be studied. Relevance: This study is important because it may define genetic risk factors for various abnormal movements, such as tremor. This will result in improved diagnosis and potentially treatment of individuals with progressive neurological diseases. These illnesses represent an important public health problem as they cause morbidity and mortality in our aging population.     n/a",Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders,7274143,K23NS052487,"['Academy', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Award', 'Biochemistry', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Colorado', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'FMR1', 'FMR1 Gene', 'FMR1 Premutation', 'FMR1 repeat expansion', 'FXTAS', 'Fellowship', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Gait abnormality', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intention Tremor', 'Laboratory Research', 'Length', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentored Clinical Oncology Award', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Award', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Range', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Subgroup', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Tremor', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'disability', 'genetic risk factor', 'improved', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'programs', 'size', 'skills']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2007,173340,-0.019134749344855546
"Brief Intervention in the ER in Poland    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aims of this Developmental Grant Proposal for Collaborative International Projects are to: 1) examine the effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) using a nurse-delivered motivational intervention, relative to standard care with and without assessment, on a reduction in heavy drinking (drinking days per week, number of drinks per day, maximum number of drinks on an occasion) and alcohol-related problems (RAPS4 and SIPS + 6) in the emergency room (ER) in Sosnowiec, Poland; and, 2) identify variables that are related to effectiveness of the intervention and that predict successful treatment outcome. We plan to translate motivational interventions that have been successful in primary care and which were recently implemented in the U.S. 14 Academic Emergency Medicine SBIRT study to a non-academic ER setting outside of the U.S. The SBIRT study, recently funded by NIAAA and SAMHSA, is the first multisite, collaborative study of screening, brief intervention and referral for at-risk and dependent drinking in the ER. We will conduct a blinded randomized brief motivational intervention trial in which both injured and noninjured patients over the aged of 18 will be screened for at-risk or dependent (using the RAPS4) drinking. Those screening positive will be asked to participate in the study. Consenting patients will be randomized into one of three groups: screened only, assessed, and brief intervention, with n=292 in each group. Intervention and assessment groups will be followed-up at 3 months and all three groups at 12 months.      Modifying variables include drinking in the event, risk taking disposition and readiness and stage of change. Prior research in the ER in Sosnowiec and a pilot feasibility study of SBIRT in Sosnowiec suggest: 1) a large number of ""at risk"", heavy problem and dependent drinkers who meet screening criteria for brief intervention in a relatively short period of time; 2) a socialized health care system which provides equal access to care and is not subject to selection bias affecting patient access; 3) a patient sample covering a large geographic area; 4) a stable environment facilitating high follow-up rates post-intervention; and, 5) a well integrated referral system and high accessibility to alcohol treatment services. Outcome data will be analyzed using ANOVA, logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations. The interaction of modifying variables on outcomes will also be analyzed. The ER is an important setting for screening and brief intervention for those with alcohol-related problems in order to reduce subsequent alcohol-related ER visits and associated costs and increase quality of life. This project will inform the development and spread of more effective techniques and protocols for addressing at-risk and dependent drinking in the ER, and provide a better understanding of those factors that influence effectiveness of brief intervention and predict successful patient outcomes.          n/a",Brief Intervention in the ER in Poland,7209884,R21AA016081,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcohols', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Cities', 'Consent', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Cultural Characteristics', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease regression', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Esthesia', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Geographic Locations', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human Resources', 'Impulsivity', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neuro-Oncological Ventral Antigen 2', 'Numbers', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Poland', 'Policies', 'Polishes', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Readiness', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Selection Bias', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Substance of Abuse', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Visit', 'Week', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'care seeking', 'cost', 'day', 'drinking', 'early /brief intervention /therapy', 'follow-up', 'injured', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'motivational intervention', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'social', 'trauma centers', 'willingness']",NIAAA,PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE,R21,2007,182784,-0.04478334497400856
"c-FN as a predictor of hemorrhagic transformation in t-PA treated stroke patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently there is only one approved drug treatment for acute ischemic stroke, t-PA. t-PA is a highly beneficial treatment but is severely underutilized due largely to fear of an often fatal side effect called hemorrhagic transformation. There is a critical clinical need for a diagnostic to identify patients that are at high and low risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT). A preliminary study showed that plasma level of cellular fibronectin (c-Fn) was predictive of t-PA induced HT. We will collect patient samples and perform a validation study to confirm the utility of c-Fn as a molecular diagnostic for the prediction of more severe forms of HT. In this study we will determine the threshold levels of c-Fn that are most predictive of outcome, determine if the elevation of c-Fn is time dependant, and follow c-Fn levels through treatment. In addition we will analyze additional plasma biomarkers, matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9), apolipoprotein C-III (Apo-C), and serum amyloid A (SAA) as potential contributors to c-Fn to more accurately predict HT. A successful diagnostic would greatly improve safety and increase use of t-PA/thrombolytics in the treatment of stroke. This validation study develops the first biomarker-based diagnostic to aid physicians in the identification of patients with high and low risk of bleeding as a result of clot busting treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Successful development will increase safety and usage of this highly beneficial treatment as well as lower overall healthcare cost as a result of stroke.          n/a",c-FN as a predictor of hemorrhagic transformation in t-PA treated stroke patients,7220477,R43NS057921,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alteplase', 'American', 'Americas', 'Apolipoproteins C', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Clot', 'Blood coagulation', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coagulation Process', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease regression', 'Economic Burden', 'Elevation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Evolution', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Fibronectins', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hour', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Metalloproteases', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-linear Models', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological reperfusion', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Factor', 'Publications', 'Purpose', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum amyloid A protein', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistically Significant', 'Stroke', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombolytic Therapy', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Trees', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Vascular blood supply', 'apolipoprotein C-III', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'desire', 'disability', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'nervous system disorder', 'point of care', 'prognostic', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"PREDICTION SCIENCES, LLC",R43,2007,206191,0.011299408753856167
"Learning Patient-Specific Models from Clinical Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Diagnosing a patient's condition and predicting the patient's outcomes are critical activities in clinical care. The better these activities can be performed, the better the patient's healthcare results are likely to be. Similarly, efficient use of healthcare resources depends upon being able to determine accurately when and where a resource is likely to be useful, which also involves making predictions. Even modest improvements in predictive accuracy can at times have significant healthcare consequences in terms of improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. Thus, for both individual patients and for society at large, making accurate healthcare predictions is an important task.      There is a clear trend toward having more and more patient data that is available electronically in healthcare information systems and in databases of clinical research studies. Thus, there is an opportunity to construct evidence-based predictive models from these data sources. Indeed, numerous clinical prediction models have already been constructed. Typically, a single prediction model has been induced from the data, and then applied -- as relevant -- to each future patient. Such a population-wide model is constructed to try to optimize its average predictive performance on all future patient cases to which it is applied. Model induction does not take advantage of information about the patient case at hand, which could potentially enhance the form and content of the model that is constructed.      The current project will investigate methods that construct patient-specific models that are sensitive to information about the patient at hand. These new methods will be evaluated for their performance in predicting patient outcomes in the diverse domains of sepsis, heart failure and substance use disorders. A variety of current population-wide model-construction methods, including logistic regression and neural networks, will serve as controls.      If patient-specific models can improve upon the predictive performance of population-wide models, as seems plausible, the added performance is likely to provide substantial benefit as a component of future computer-based decision-support systems for clinical care. n/a",Learning Patient-Specific Models from Clinical Data,7185137,R01LM008374,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sepsis', 'Societies', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'insight', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2007,278631,0.00783049291021821
"Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persons with a primary malignant brain tumor (PMBT) often suffer significant functional and neurologic morbidity causing family caregivers to assume the care recipient's familial, social, and financial obligations. Research has shown that caregivers of persons with other chronic diseases develop negative consequences as a result of providing care. Despite high morbidity (and mortality) rates for persons with a PMBT, caregiver issues in neuro-oncology have been virtually ignored. In response to PA-05-027, the purposes of this study are to use a multidisciplinary, integrative model, the Pittsburgh Mind Body Center Model, to (1) examine the psycho-behavioral responses (i.e. depressive symptoms and sleep), biologic responses (i.e. blood pressure and ihterleukins) and overall physical health of family members of persons with a PMBT at the time of diagnosis, and (2) to describe how relationships within the model vary over time in response to changes in the care recipient's illness trajectory as the family member transitions to a family caregiver. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) examine how care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho- behavioral responses, biologic responses, and overall physical health change over time (from PBMT diagnosis to 12 months after diagnosis); and during this 12-month period, to 2) examine how caregivers' personal characteristics moderate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' psycho-behavioral responses; 3) examine how caregiver psycho-behavioral responses mediate the relationship between care recipients' disease characteristics and caregivers' biologic responses; and 4) examine how caregivers' biologic responses mediate the relationship between their psycho-behavioral responses and overall physical health. A descriptive longitudinal design will be used to collect data to address the aims of the project. Linear and logistic regression analysis will be used to model baseline responses. Repeated measures analysis (random coefficients modeling) will be used to examine change over time and latent growth curve modeling will be used to further explore longitudinal data. The relevance of the project to public health is to identify caregivers at specific time-points during the care recipient's disease trajectory who are vulnerable to changes in their emotional and physical health. Improving caregivers' emotional and physical health may improve the delivery of care and quality of life for the care recipient.           n/a",Mind-Body Interactions in Neuro-Oncology Family Caregivers,7213092,R01CA118711,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Endocrine', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Face', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Functional disorder', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Rate', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Institutionalization', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Love', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Rate', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Obligations', 'Stress', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'body-mind', 'care delivery', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disease characteristic', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'mind body interaction', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'social']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2007,398357,0.009425789000274623
"Serum Vitamin D and Mortality from Eye Melanoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uveal ('eye') melanomas are aggressive neoplasms that evolve in the choroidal tissues of the inner eye. The goal of this research is to examine whether serum levels of vitamin D, a 'nutrient' derived from sun exposure, is a prognostic factor in melanoma of the eye. The hormonally active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol), is a well-known potent regulator of cell growth and differentiation in cells and tissues expressing the vitamin D receptor (VDR), and there is recent evidence of an inhibiting effect on tumor invasion and metastasis. However, only limited data are available from human studies. The proposed investigation will be based on a large series of eye melanoma patients treated over a 13 year period (1992-2004) at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, in Boston, a leading referral center for diagnosis and treatment of these tumors. Blood samples were collected at the time of diagnosis and serum and buffy coat fractions were stored at -70C. In the planned study, vital status of the patients will be updated on all surviving patients by chart review and a search of the Social Security, and National Death Indexes. Of 1,493 patients with stored sera and DNA, an estimated 272 deaths from tumor causes (the 'cases') will be identified (median follow up: 8.7 years). For each case, one matched control will be selected, similar to the case on clinical prognostic factors and year of diagnosis, and alive and free of metastasis. Serum samples will be tested for levels of calcidiol (25(OH)D3), the depot for biosynthesis of active vitamin D. Case-control comparisons for vitamin levels will be performed using conditional logistic regression. Specific genotypes and haplotypes in the VDR will also be examined for relationships to melanoma outcome, and interactions with serum vitamin D levels will be explored. To our knowledge, this will be the first investigation of its kind, based on a unique resource of prospectively collected serum and DNA, and long-term patient follow up. The proposed study will provide new information on the relationship of vitamin D to mortality from eye melanoma. Because vitamin D is believed to have multiple inhibitory actions in cancer metastasis, the data may be applicable to other cancer sites. If the proposed hypotheses are supported, findings may offer novel insights, and point to new strategies for cancer control.           n/a",Serum Vitamin D and Mortality from Eye Melanoma,7151718,R03CA119751,"['death', 'diagnosis', 'eye', 'melanoma', 'metastasis', 'neoplasm /cancer', 'serum', 'vitamin D']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2006,4780,-0.029838401540660912
"Adolescent Preventive Services: Disparities and Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rationale and Objectives: Significant racial/ethnic disparities in health care utilization exist among adolescents. When adolescents do access the system, the preventive services delivery is below the recommended levels. However, little is known about racial/ethnic disparities in preventive services delivery. Minority adolescents have higher rates of risky health behaviors and associated outcomes in several key areas that are preventable. The long-term research objective is to decrease racial/ethnic disparities in adolescent health behaviors and outcomes. Specific aims are to determine if: 1) There are racial/ethnic disparities in the delivery of adolescent preventive services; 2) An intervention to increase the delivery of preventive services in primary care reduces racial/ethnic disparities in the receipt of preventive services; 3) Receipt of preventive services has a similar effect on adolescents of different racial/ethnic backgrounds. Research Design: Population: 2 samples will be utilized: 1) UCSF Sample: 3369 adolescents participated in an evaluation of adolescent preventive services in a large managed care organization; and 2) CHIS sample: 2898 California adolescents participated in The California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) in 2001. Measures: UCSF adolescent participants completed surveys immediately following clinical well care visits that queried whether providers screened and counseled them during the visit in 3 target areas: substance use, safety, and sexual behavior. A UCSF subsample also participated in a longitudinal study of health behaviors, completing health outcome and self-efficacy surveys prior to well visits and one year later at a 2nd annual well visit. CHIS participants completed phone surveys that included their attendance of well visits and whether their providers screened them in target areas. Methods: Secondary data analyses of these established data sets will be conducted to test for the presence of racial/ethnic disparities in adolescent preventive services and outcomes. We will conduct multiple regression and logistic regression analyses to examine the proposed aims. Outcomes for aims 1 and 2 are provider screening and counseling during well visits. Outcomes for aim 3 are behavior change and self- efficacy in the longitudinal subsample of adolescents who received preventive services. We will control for covariation from variables including adolescent characteristics, such as age and gender, and family characteristics, such as socio-economic status. Public Health Relevance: The identification of racial/ethnic disparities in preventive services delivery could increase awareness and prompt improvements in healthcare for all adolescents. The identification of disparities in health behavior and self-efficacy outcomes as the result of preventive services could lead to increased focus on meeting the needs of adolescents of differing racial/ethnic backgrounds.         n/a",Adolescent Preventive Services: Disparities and Outcomes,7128193,R03NR009397,"['adolescence (12-20)', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'health behavior', 'health care service evaluation', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'managed care', 'racial /ethnic difference', 'sex behavior', 'statistics /biometry', 'substance abuse related disorder', 'transportation /recreation safety']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R03,2006,73970,-0.008984035496588844
"Utility of Trans Telephonic Monitoring in the Detection of Silent Arrhythmias    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this feasibility study is to determine if a Cardiac Arrhythmia Trans telephonic EKG monitoring system (CAT) can be used to detect asymptomatic or ""silent"" arrhythmias in patients greater than or equal to 65 years of age with a history of hypertension (HTN) and heart failure (HF) and characterize their onset, frequency, and duration. The secondary aim is to examine the association between silent arrhythmias and quality of life (QoL). Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and its prevalence increases with age, HTN, and HF. It also has a profound impact on QoL. Whether silent or symptomatic, AF can result in stroke. Detection of silent arrhythmias, especially silent AF, could prompt the initiation of anticoagulation that would decrease the occurrence of stroke, which is the third leading cause of death in the US. As treatment for HTN and HF continue to improve, combined with increased life expectancy, early arrhythmia identification strategies are urgently needed to predict who is at the highest risk for silent arrhythmias. Standard methods for detecting AF include 12-lead EKGs, 24-hour Holter recorders (HM) and non-auto-triggered memory loop recorders (MLR). MLRs are unable to automatically detect and capture silent arrhythmias since they require patient activation during symptoms. Auto-triggered MLRs (AT-MLR) have recently become available which automatically record arrhythmias, with or without associated symptoms, and the stored EKG data can then be transmitted trans telephonically (via phone) to a central monitoring station. A recently completed retrospective analysis has shown that AT-MLRs produced a higher yield of diagnostic events and an earlier time to diagnosis of silent arrhythmias as compared to HM or MLR. This study proposes a single-center, prospective consecutive series of 100 patients using a 14-day CAT monitoring period. At baseline and 6 months, cardiac clinical characteristics and risk factors will be collected from patients via physical exam and chart review, and the SF-36v2(TM) will be administered to determine if differences exist in perceived QoL in patients with silent AF. Information regarding AF frequency and duration will be quantified using the University of Toronto Atrial Fibrillation Scale (AFSS). Spearman's correlation will be used to assess the association between AF and changes in SF-36v2(TM) QoL scores between baseline and 6 months. The relationship between AF, demographic, and clinical characteristics will be determined using logistic regression analysis. All significant univariate variables will be entered into a multivariate logistic regression model. The results of this feasibility study could potentially justify development of a new screening mechanism for silent AF. If this study proves successful, a larger trial will be proposed to explore specific clinical variables, EKG characteristics, and treatment strategies to improve clinical care and QoL.           n/a",Utility of Trans Telephonic Monitoring in the Detection of Silent Arrhythmias,7132412,R03NR010001,"['arrhythmia', 'clinical research']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2006,80500,0.022847480109990964

Specific genotypes and haplotypes in the VDR will also be examined for relationships to melanoma outcome, and interactions with serum vitamin D levels will be explored. To our knowledge, this will be the first investigation of its kind, based on a unique resource of prospectively collected serum and DNA, and long-term patient follow up. The proposed study will provide new information on the relationship of vitamin D to mortality from eye melanoma. Because vitamin D is believed to have multiple inhibitory actions in cancer metastasis, the data may be applicable to other cancer sites. If the proposed hypotheses are supported, findings may offer novel insights, and point to new strategies for cancer control.           n/a",Serum Vitamin D and Mortality from Eye Melanoma,7322498,R03CA119751,[' '],NCI,H.

"Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Deborah Ann Hall is applying for a Pentored Patient-Oriented Research (K23) Award in the area of movement disorders. This proposal describes a research and training program for the development of a clinician-investigator in neurology. The principal investigator, Dr. Hall, has completed neurology residency training and a movement disorders fellowship. She received a competitive clinical research fellowship from the American Academy of Neurology and is pursuing a Ph.D. in Clinical Science. The candidate's immediate goals are to continue research in the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, by directly applying her newly acquired epidemiologic and biostatistics skills in the proposed project. Her long term goals are to study the genetic risk factors, neuroepidemiology and treatment of ataxia, including sporadic ataxia. During the award period, Dr. Hall will be based in the Department of Neurology at the University of Colorado (UCDHSC). UCDHSC has an extensive track record for supporting and developing clinician-investigators. The Ph.D. in Clinical Sciences program at UCDHSC facilitates mentored multidisciplinary clinical research. The candidate will carry out her research with Professors Tim Byers MD (Epidemiology), Maureen Leehey MD (Neurology), Gary Zerbe PhD (Biostatistics), and Paul Hagerman MD PhD (Biological Chemistry). Dr. Hall's research program is to determine the prevalence of repeat expansions in the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation) gene in subjects with tremor, ataxia and/or parkinsonism. Dr. Hall will do a cross-sectional study by recruiting subjects in her clinics with the three phenotypes and performing PCR of the FMR1 gene. All subjects eligible will be recruited and the genetic testing will be done in a research laboratory. The primary outcomes to be measured are the prevalence of repeat expansions in the three groups combined and each phenotypic subgroup. The age of onset, age of diagnosis of neurological signs and correlations between tri-nucleotide repeat size and phenotype are also outcomes to be measured. Linear and logistic regression models will be used and covariates including race and ethnicity will be studied. Relevance: This study is important because it may define genetic risk factors for various abnormal movements, such as tremor. This will result in improved diagnosis and potentially treatment of individuals with progressive neurological diseases. These illnesses represent an important public health problem as they cause morbidity and mortality in our aging population.     n/a",Prevalence of FMRI Expansions in Movement Disorders,7103035,K23NS052487,"['aging', 'ataxia', 'cerebellar ataxia /dyskinesia', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis', 'genes', 'genetics', 'phenotype', 'tremor']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2006,187920,-0.019134749344855546
"Common and specific risk factors for emotional disorders This is a collaborative research effort of Northwestern University and the University of California, Los Angeles to evaluate common and specific risk factors for anxiety disorders and depression.  Each site will work on a common protocol.  We propose a prospective longitudinal study of 700 high school juniors, recruited in two cohorts over consecutive years at two high schools (Evanston and Santa Monica).  Using a high-risk design, participants at high risk (according to Neuroticism cores) will be oversampled relative to medium and low risk groups.  Their progression will be carefully tracked over the course of 8 to 10 assessments staggered over four to four and a half years of data collection.  The participant sample will be geographically, ethnically, and socio-economically diverse.  The proposal takes a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach to the conceptualization and measurement of risk factors, which include Neuroticism, depressogenic cognitive style, anxiety sensitivity, introversion and low positive affectivity, sociotropy and autonomy.  Measures will include self report, parental report, as well as information processing tasks (modified Stroop, memory tasks), affective modulation of startle reactivity, and ambulatory cortisol assays.  In addition, diathesis-stress interactions will be evaluated on the basis of contextual assessment of chronic and episodic life stress.  Outcome will be measured in terms of symptoms and diagnosis of anxiety and depression.  Various models of commonalities and specificities of risk and their interaction with stress will be tested using hierarchical logistic regression and structural equation modeling.

"Paperless Quality Donor System with Decision Making DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The long-term objectives of this project are to improve the safety and availability of the US blood supply. The principal aim of this SBIR Competing Continuation Phase II Proposal for a Paperless Quality Donor System with Decision Making is to complete the development of its Quality Donor System(tm) (QDS) and to secure ongoing 510(k) clearances for it from the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Biologies Evaluation and Research (CBER) for implementation and evaluation of the total system in blood centers and hospital blood banks.      The research is based on continuing development of the Quality Donor System and deploying it in regional blood centers and hospital blood banks. System use by donors and staff and user satisfaction will be measured and analyzed to assess success. Blood safety is enhanced by eliminating FDA-reportable errors and by increasing blood donor honesty in disclosing risky behaviors. Blood availability is enhanced by increasing donor satisfaction, resulting in higher return rates for new blood donors and increasing employer sponsorship of blood drives. n/a",Paperless Quality Donor System with Decision Making,7127266,R44HL072635,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'blood bank /supply contamination', 'blood donor', 'case history', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'decision making', 'human subject', 'interview', 'nonEnglish language', 'patient safety /medical error', 'phlebotomy']",NHLBI,"TALISMAN, LTD",R44,2006,927498,0.0002652362439145779
"Adolescent Preventive Services: Disparities and Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rationale and Objectives: Significant racial/ethnic disparities in health care utilization exist among adolescents. When adolescents do access the system, the preventive services delivery is below the recommended levels. However, little is known about racial/ethnic disparities in preventive services delivery. Minority adolescents have higher rates of risky health behaviors and associated outcomes in several key areas that are preventable. The long-term research objective is to decrease racial/ethnic disparities in adolescent health behaviors and outcomes. Specific aims are to determine if: 1) There are racial/ethnic disparities in the delivery of adolescent preventive services; 2) An intervention to increase the delivery of preventive services in primary care reduces racial/ethnic disparities in the receipt of preventive services; 3) Receipt of preventive services has a similar effect on adolescents of different racial/ethnic backgrounds. Research Design: Population: 2 samples will be utilized: 1) UCSF Sample: 3369 adolescents participated in an evaluation of adolescent preventive services in a large managed care organization; and 2) CHIS sample: 2898 California adolescents participated in The California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) in 2001. Measures: UCSF adolescent participants completed surveys immediately following clinical well care visits that queried whether providers screened and counseled them during the visit in 3 target areas: substance use, safety, and sexual behavior. A UCSF subsample also participated in a longitudinal study of health behaviors, completing health outcome and self-efficacy surveys prior to well visits and one year later at a 2nd annual well visit. CHIS participants completed phone surveys that included their attendance of well visits and whether their providers screened them in target areas. Methods: Secondary data analyses of these established data sets will be conducted to test for the presence of racial/ethnic disparities in adolescent preventive services and outcomes. We will conduct multiple regression and logistic regression analyses to examine the proposed aims. Outcomes for aims 1 and 2 are provider screening and counseling during well visits. Outcomes for aim 3 are behavior change and self- efficacy in the longitudinal subsample of adolescents who received preventive services. We will control for covariation from variables including adolescent characteristics, such as age and gender, and family characteristics, such as socio-economic status. Public Health Relevance: The identification of racial/ethnic disparities in preventive services delivery could increase awareness and prompt improvements in healthcare for all adolescents. The identification of disparities in health behavior and self-efficacy outcomes as the result of preventive services could lead to increased focus on meeting the needs of adolescents of differing racial/ethnic backgrounds.         n/a",Adolescent Preventive Services: Disparities and Outcomes,7037713,R03NR009397,"['adolescence (12-20)', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'health behavior', 'health care service evaluation', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'managed care', 'racial /ethnic difference', 'sex behavior', 'statistics /biometry', 'substance abuse related disorder', 'transportation /recreation safety']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R03,2005,75750,-0.008984035496588844
"Environmental Risk Factors and Canine Malignant Lymphoma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The incidence of human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in the US has nearly doubled over the previous 30 years. Epidemiologic research has evaluated a variety of factors potentially associated with risk of NHL but results have been inconsistent and cannot explain the dramatic increase in incidence. Several epidemiologic studies in humans have suggested that exposure to household environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), lawn care herbicides, and pesticides such as those contained in flea control products may plausibly increase risk of NHL, but these relationships have not been well evaluated. Epidemiologic studies of companion animals offer a complementary means by which to identify risk factors for cancers of relevance to both animals and humans. Because canine malignant lymphoma (CML) has been established as a model for NHL and domestic dogs share their living environment with their human owners, a study of environmental exposures and CML provides a unique opportunity to evaluate factors that may potentially relate to NHL. The proposed case-control study will use hospital records to identify cases of CML and 2 control groups of dogs, one consisting of dogs with benign tumors and one consisting of dog with non-cancer chronic diseases, seen at the Foster Hospital at Tufts University between 2000 and 2005. Owners of CML cases and controls will be sent a questionnaire to assess household ETS, use of flea control products, lawn care herbicides and other factors prior to diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression will then be used to evaluate the relationship between environmental exposures and risk of CML. In addition, because the methods used in epidemiologic studies of companion animals are not well established, the proposed project will also include a validation study of ETS exposure measurement, and evaluate if owner characteristics are associated with likelihood of returning a mailed questionnaire. Owners of 1000 dogs presenting to Foster Hospital over a two-month period will be asked to complete a questionnaire measuring demographic and environmental factors, and to provide a urine sample from their dog. Urine samples from approximately 130 dogs will be assayed for level of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine well established as a biologic marker for ETS exposure, and cotinine levels will be compared with level of household smoking reported by questionnaire. One year later, a second questionnaire will be mailed to all participants, and characteristics of respondent and non-respondent owners will be compared. Any differences will then be taken into consideration in the calculation of relative risks using a novel form of sensitivity analysis to produce more accurate estimates of the association between environmental exposures and risk of CML. Because dogs and their human owners share a common environment within the household, results from this study will have direct relevance to the on-going effort to identify factors that may increase risk of human NHL. n/a",Environmental Risk Factors and Canine Malignant Lymphoma,6931858,R03CA103513,"['cancer risk', 'clinical research', 'disease /disorder model', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'dogs', 'environmental exposure', 'herbicides', 'human subject', 'lymphoma', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'nicotine', 'nonHodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'passive smoking', 'pesticide biological effect', 'pesticide residues', 'pesticides', 'questionnaires', 'veterinary medicine']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R03,2005,76639,-0.00866636821663465
"Older Adults & Drug Decisions: Collaboration & Outcomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Midst growing time pressures on physicians, there is a need to maintain and even enhance the quality of physician-patient encounters, particularly for vulnerable, older adults with chronic conditions. Substantial research suggests that older adults are more passive than other age groups during their visits. Hence, physicians may miss key information about patient concerns and regimens that could affect health outcomes. This research addresses gaps identified by literature reviews calling for studies evaluating interventions that efficiently elicit patient pre-visit expectations for physicians and examine the longitudinal effect of expectation fulfillment on patient outcomes. The goal of this research is to study the impact of an intervention that identifies pre-visit concerns of older adult patients and then prompts both patients and physicians to address these concerns in the visit. Older adults' functional status concerns will be identified briefly in the waiting room using a handheld computer. A printout summarizing patient responses will be given both to the physician and patient. We hypothesize that this prompt will affect the nature of the patient-provider encounter in such a way that health outcomes will be improved. To test these hypotheses, a final sample of 580 patients age 60 or older, with a formal diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis will be enrolled at their clinic visit. A one-year randomized, controlled experiment will be used in which an experimental group patients receive a computerized assessment and prompt about their visit concerns while a control group receives a parallel placebo computerized assessment of their exercise patterns. In both cases, patient assessment summaries are given to the patients and to their physicians in the medical record. Baseline, 6 month and 12 month data will be collected on each patient. We hypothesize improved health status at 12 months for the primary outcomes of pain and physical function. Selected encounter dynamics hypothesized to help explain these outcomes will also be examined. We will audiotape patient-physician encounters to study these interaction dynamics. The primary analyses will examine differences at 12 months between the control and experimental groups using ANCOVA for continuous variables with baseline values of outcomes as a covariate, Dichotomous outcomes will be analyzed primarily by the Mantel Haenszel test and logistic regression.   n/a",Older Adults & Drug Decisions: Collaboration & Outcomes,6927154,R01AG018362,"['audiotape', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'communication', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'functional ability', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'longitudinal human study', 'outcomes research', 'pain', 'patient care personnel relations', 'physicians', 'questionnaires', 'rheumatoid arthritis']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,R01,2005,150000,0.003835191742792602

"Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Most disasters are readily identifiable but health care disasters may not be as readily recognized, particularly early in their evolution. Syndromic surveillance, one kind of health care disaster, is the term coined for systems that use data that precede diagnosis to recognize disease outbreaks with sufficient specificity to warrant a public health response. Algorithms designed for early detection of health care disasters that rely solely on temporal trends may not be specific enough and several investigators have begun to incorporate geospatial clustering into the pattern recognition algorithms in order to improve specificity. Knowing the specific geographic location of the patient's home address would allow easy identification of a patient in many cases, however, we propose to develop and characterize pattern recognition algorithms that operate on deidentified data in order to protect patients' privacy. We will carry out this work using actual data from two different cities in order to increase the chance that the approach developed can be generalized. The overall approach would be to utilize established pattern recognition algorithms developed at Children's Hospital in Boston, and modify them as needed to accommodate use of deidentified data. Then we will compare the detection characteristics of the algorithm using identifiable data and deidentified data in order to determine the effect of using deidentified data. n/a",Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis,6930547,R21LM007970,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioterrorism /chemical warfare', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'disasters', 'disease outbreaks', 'early diagnosis', 'geographic site', 'human data', 'human population study', 'public health']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R21,2005,594222,0.0015602075149596126

"Allergic Condition Biomarkers and Glioma Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    An inverse association between self-reported allergic conditions (ACs) and glioma has been previously observed in seven case-control and two cohort studies. The mechanism for this association is not known, however, two cytokines that play a central role in ACs (i.e., interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13) also suppress glioma growth. From among genetic polymorphisms that are associated with risk of ACs, we have identified polymorphisms also involved in normal astrocyte growth or glioma pathogenesis. Gene products of genetic polymorphisms found on the IL-4, IL-13, IL-4Ralpha, IL-13Ralpha1, HLA -DRB1, RANTES, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) play a role in both ACs and the brain. We will examine the case-control distribution of these polymorphisms and haplotypes to: 1) test the hypothesis that polymorphisms associated with ACs reduce glioma risk; 2) identify differential misclassification of serf-reported ACs (unequal measurement of cases and controls); 3) find out whether antihistamine use interferes with protection against glioma afforded by ACs; and 4) determine whether AC polymorphisms affect glioma risk independently of their association with ACs. The innovation in the proposed study is to focus on polymorphisms associated with ACs, an epidemiologic risk factor that reduces glioma risk, rather than on polymorphisms associated with carcinogenesis as has been done in previous studies.      Our pilot study will make use of interviews with 260 glioma cases and 450 controls that have already been conducted and blood samples that have been collected in conjunction a population-based case-control study of mobile telephone use and brain tumors in Sweden. Study participants were asked whether they have been diagnosed with asthma, eczema, hay fever or other allergies, continue to have allergies, have symptoms of allergies without a diagnosis, and have used allergy medication. Twenty ml of blood from each participant was collected and stored in a -80 degree freezer and DNA preparation is ongoing. Each participant will be evaluated for the presence AC polymorphisms. Unconditional logistic regression will be used to estimate the association between AC polymorphisms and glioma risk. Assuming a 0.05 significance level and 80 percent power, depending on the polymorphism, the proposed sample is large enough to detect a confounding-adjusted odds ratios of 0.6. n/a",Allergic Condition Biomarkers and Glioma Risk,6796148,R03CA103379,"['MHC class II antigen', 'antihistamines', 'biomarker', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis inhibitor', 'chemokine', 'clinical research', 'cytokine receptors', 'genetic polymorphism', 'glioma', 'human data', 'human genetic material tag', 'human tissue', 'hypersensitivity', 'interleukin 13', 'interleukin 4', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'neoplasm /cancer immunology', 'nitric oxide synthase']",NCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2004,68103,-0.032857627707640724
"Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexually transmitted infections of the genital tract (STIs) and non-sexually transmitted infections of the urinary tract (UTIs) share common risk factors and presenting symptoms in women of reproductive age. Because adolescents constitute the age group at highest risk for STIs, the CDC recommends annual screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) in all sexually active (SA) adolescents, regardless of symptoms. Because the clinical presentations of CT, GC, Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), and UTI may be similar, many experts recommend interim testing for all four infections in SA adolescent females who have urinary symptoms. Despite these recommendations, there are important gaps between ideal and actual clinical practice. The availability of sensitive and specific, non-invasive tests for CT, GC, and TV may increase both routine and symptom-based STI screening of SA adolescents. However, important questions regarding the triage of symptomatic patients remain unanswered. The goal of the proposed study is to elucidate the association between STIs and UTIs in SA adolescent females. It focuses on the three STIs that are highly prevalent, likely to cause urinary symptoms, and detectable on tests of urine or patient-obtained vaginal samples. The study sample will consist of 474 SA adolescent females presenting to a hospital-based teen health center w/urinary symptoms (n=158) and w/o urinary symptoms (n=316). Each subject will be interviewed during the visit by a trained research assistant for chief complaint, genitourinary symptoms, sexual history, and past medical history. Prior to physical examination, each subject will provide a urine sample and a self-collected vaginal swab sample. The urine will be tested by ligase chain reaction for CT and GC and cultured for bacteria; the vaginal sample will be cultured for TV. The CT, GC and TV prevalence rates will be compared in subjects with and without urinary symptoms and in subjects with and without UTI, defined as over 1000 colonies of a single organism. Best subset logistic regression analyses will be performed to identify the variables that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have CT, GC, and/or TV, and the variable that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have UTIs. The findings of this study will strengthen the evidence base for symptom-based STI testing of SA adolescent females and will promote care that addresses both individual patient and public health needs.         n/a",Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?,6725468,R03AI054616,"['Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Trichomonas vaginalis', 'adolescence (12-20)', 'clinical research', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'female', 'gonorrhea', 'human subject', 'interview', 'reproductive system infection', 'sexually transmitted diseases', 'sign /symptom', 'urinalysis', 'urinary tract infection', 'women&apos', 's health']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL MED CTR (CINCINNATI),R03,2004,74500,-0.0019515072715885838

The proposed case-control study will use hospital records to identify cases of CML and 2 control groups of dogs, one consisting of dogs with benign tumors and one consisting of dog with non-cancer chronic diseases, seen at the Foster Hospital at Tufts University between 2000 and 2005. Owners of CML cases and controls will be sent a questionnaire to assess household ETS, use of flea control products, lawn care herbicides and other factors prior to diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression will then be used to evaluate the relationship between environmental exposures and risk of CML. In addition, because the methods used in epidemiologic studies of companion animals are not well established, the proposed project will also include a validation study of ETS exposure measurement, and evaluate if owner characteristics are associated with likelihood of returning a mailed questionnaire. Owners of 1000 dogs presenting to Foster Hospital over a two-month period will be asked to complete a questionnaire measuring demographic and environmental factors, and to provide a urine sample from their dog. Urine samples from approximately 130 dogs will be assayed for level of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine well established as a biologic marker for ETS exposure, and cotinine levels will be compared with level of household smoking reported by questionnaire. One year later, a second questionnaire will be mailed to all participants, and characteristics of respondent and non-respondent owners will be compared. Any differences will then be taken into consideration in the calculation of relative risks using a novel form of sensitivity analysis to produce more accurate estimates of the association between environmental exposures and risk of CML. Because dogs and their human owners share a common environment within the household, results from this study will have direct relevance to the on-going effort to identify factors that may increase risk of human NHL. n/a",Environmental Risk Factors and Canine Malignant Lymphoma,6795262,R03CA103513,"['cancer risk', 'clinical research', 'disease /disorder model', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'dogs', 'environmental exposure', 'herbicides', 'human subject', 'lymphoma', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'nicotine', 'nonHodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'passive smoking', 'pesticide biological effect', 'pesticide residues', 'pesticides', 'questionnaires', 'veterinary medicine']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R03,2004,76639,-0.00866636821663465
"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are, they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms   2) Accommodative Mechanisms   3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms   There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term, we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause. In phase 1, we propose to:   Clinically define CVS by observing the incidence of ocular surface abnormalities in symptomatic subjects and compare them with an age and sex matched non-symptomatic control population   Develop specialized micro-environment glasses to combat CVS symptoms   Study the efficacy of micro-environment glasses in symptomatic and control populations   Critically evaluate viability of CVS micro-environment glasses as a commercial product      using both statistical methods and subjective questionnaires.            n/a",Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS,6792878,R41EY015023,"['age difference', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computers', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'gender difference', 'human subject', 'keratoconjunctivitis sicca', 'occupational health /safety', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'questionnaires', 'syndrome', 'vision aid', 'vision disorders', 'visual photosensitivity', 'work site']",NEI,"SEEFIT, INC.",R41,2004,100000,-0.04486785059755166
"Older Adults & Drug Decisions: Collaboration & Outcomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Midst growing time pressures on physicians, there is a need to maintain and even enhance the quality of physician-patient encounters, particularly for vulnerable, older adults with chronic conditions. Substantial research suggests that older adults are more passive than other age groups during their visits. Hence, physicians may miss key information about patient concerns and regimens that could affect health outcomes. This research addresses gaps identified by literature reviews calling for studies evaluating interventions that efficiently elicit patient pre-visit expectations for physicians and examine the longitudinal effect of expectation fulfillment on patient outcomes. The goal of this research is to study the impact of an intervention that identifies pre-visit concerns of older adult patients and then prompts both patients and physicians to address these concerns in the visit. Older adults' functional status concerns will be identified briefly in the waiting room using a handheld computer. A printout summarizing patient responses will be given both to the physician and patient. We hypothesize that this prompt will affect the nature of the patient-provider encounter in such a way that health outcomes will be improved. To test these hypotheses, a final sample of 580 patients age 60 or older, with a formal diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis will be enrolled at their clinic visit. A one-year randomized, controlled experiment will be used in which an experimental group patients receive a computerized assessment and prompt about their visit concerns while a control group receives a parallel placebo computerized assessment of their exercise patterns. In both cases, patient assessment summaries are given to the patients and to their physicians in the medical record. Baseline, 6 month and 12 month data will be collected on each patient. We hypothesize improved health status at 12 months for the primary outcomes of pain and physical function. Selected encounter dynamics hypothesized to help explain these outcomes will also be examined. We will audiotape patient-physician encounters to study these interaction dynamics. The primary analyses will examine differences at 12 months between the control and experimental groups using ANCOVA for continuous variables with baseline values of outcomes as a covariate, Dichotomous outcomes will be analyzed primarily by the Mantel Haenszel test and logistic regression.   n/a",Older Adults & Drug Decisions: Collaboration & Outcomes,6789322,R01AG018362,"['audiotape', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'communication', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'functional ability', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'longitudinal human study', 'outcomes research', 'pain', 'patient care personnel relations', 'physicians', 'questionnaires', 'rheumatoid arthritis']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,R01,2004,150000,0.003835191742792602
"An Expert System to Reduce Depression in Primary Care A variety of effective interventions exist for people who seek help for depression. However, there is a lack of effective interventions for individuals who do not seek help or follow through with treatment referrals. We propose to fill this gap in services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model-based intervention that will be delivered proactively, on a population basis, to primary care patients who are experiencing symptoms of depression but are not currently involved in treatment. It is the first intervention for depression that is appropriate for individuals in all stages of change-not merely the minority who are prepared to take action. In Phase I of this Fast Track Initiative, the aims are to norm TTM measures, develop the TTM interventions, and determine the feasibility of this approach by assessing study recruitment rates and reactions to the intervention materials. Primary care patients who screen positive for mild to moderate depression and are not involved in treatment will complete surveys for measurement norming (n=100) or participate in a pilot-test of the intervention materials (n=50). If feasibility conditions are met, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial in Phase II to assess the efficacy of the expert system intervention for depression. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Depression is a costly illness for health care organizations, disability insurers, and employers because of increased health service utilization, disability claims, and lost productively among depressed individuals.

"CHILD ABUSE REPORTING EXPERIENCE STUDY (CARES)   The number of children who are maltreated each year in the US                      continues to increase. Despite this alarming statistic, primary care                 practitioners (PCPs)are not frequent reporters of suspected child abuse              (SCAN)to government child protection agencies (CPS). The reasons for this are        not yet understood. This proposed research will provide the first                    comprehensive description and analysis of the management of SCAN in primary          care practices.                                                                                                                                                           This study is a prospective descriptive study of practitioner management of          16,000 childhood injuries. Data will be collected in the Pediatric Research in       Office Setting (PROS)Network using a protocol that is derived from one that          was piloted in a regional practice-based research network (PBRN). Four hundred       PROS PCP will each gather information about 40 consecutive injury visits. They       will report medical diagnosis, demographic information, and their level of           suspicion for child physical abuse. Follow-up telephone calls to the PCP will        elicit further information about the management of these injuries. This data         will be used to construct vignettes. The response of a panel of child abuse          experts to these vignettes will be used to evaluate the PCP management of            suspected abuse and the rate of false positive and false negative reports to         CPS.                                                                                                                                                                      The data collected will be used to address the following specific aims               concerning the care of SCAN by PCPs: (1) Identify PCP related factors that           affect identification of maltreatment; (2) Identify PCP related factors that         affect management of any suspicious injuries; and, (3) Assess the validity of        PCP management of childhood injuries.

"Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Most disasters are readily identifiable but health care disasters may not be as readily recognized, particularly early in their evolution. Syndromic surveillance, one kind of health care disaster, is the term coined for systems that use data that precede diagnosis to recognize disease outbreaks with sufficient specificity to warrant a public health response. Algorithms designed for early detection of health care disasters that rely solely on temporal trends may not be specific enough and several investigators have begun to incorporate geospatial clustering into the pattern recognition algorithms in order to improve specificity. Knowing the specific geographic location of the patient's home address would allow easy identification of a patient in many cases, however, we propose to develop and characterize pattern recognition algorithms that operate on deidentified data in order to protect patients' privacy. We will carry out this work using actual data from two different cities in order to increase the chance that the approach developed can be generalized. The overall approach would be to utilize established pattern recognition algorithms developed at Children's Hospital in Boston, and modify them as needed to accommodate use of deidentified data. Then we will compare the detection characteristics of the algorithm using identifiable data and deidentified data in order to determine the effect of using deidentified data. n/a",Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis,6800057,R21LM007970,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioterrorism /chemical warfare', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'disasters', 'disease outbreaks', 'early diagnosis', 'geographic site', 'human data', 'human population study', 'public health']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R21,2004,607174,0.0015602075149596126
"Ethnic Variation in Hospice Use Among Cancer Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Within the last three decades, hospice care has emerged as an important form of end-of-life care in the United States. Hospice care provides an alternative to traditional, curative medicine by offering dying patients palliation from physical, emotional and spiritual suffering. In the last decade, hospice utilization in the United States has increased rapidly. In addition, the type of patient entering hospice care has changed. Until recently, the majority of patients using hospice care were older, middle class, and non-Hispanic Whites with a cancer diagnosis. Now, as the older adult population becomes more ethnically diverse and advances continue to be made in life-prolonging technologies, the profile of the typical hospice patient is also changing.      There is a growing concern in the hospice community that members of racial and ethnic minority groups are underutilizing hospice care in comparison to Non-Hispanic Whites. It is important to: 1) determine if disparities in hospice utilization exist among different racial and ethnic groups; and 2) explain why these disparities exist. The purpose of this study is to examine variation in the use of hospice care by patient race and ethnicity.      The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) investigate differences in the use of hospice care by patient race and ethnicity; 2) examine racial and ethnic differences in hospice use by type of cancer diagnosis; 3) assess racial and ethnic differences in the use of hospice care by geographic location; and   4) examine variation in the use of hospice care over time by patient race and ethnicity.      Data from the linked SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)-Medicare database will be used to study hospice care utilization in subjects diagnosed with breast, lung, colorectal or prostate cancer from 1986 to 1996 at age 65 and over who died from 1991 to 1999. The SEER population covers approximately 14% of the United States. Logistic regression analyses and chi-square analyses will be used to achieve the study goals.

"Allergic Condition Biomarkers and Glioma Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    An inverse association between self-reported allergic conditions (ACs) and glioma has been previously observed in seven case-control and two cohort studies. The mechanism for this association is not known, however, two cytokines that play a central role in ACs (i.e., interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13) also suppress glioma growth. From among genetic polymorphisms that are associated with risk of ACs, we have identified polymorphisms also involved in normal astrocyte growth or glioma pathogenesis. Gene products of genetic polymorphisms found on the IL-4, IL-13, IL-4Ralpha, IL-13Ralpha1, HLA -DRB1, RANTES, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) play a role in both ACs and the brain. We will examine the case-control distribution of these polymorphisms and haplotypes to: 1) test the hypothesis that polymorphisms associated with ACs reduce glioma risk; 2) identify differential misclassification of serf-reported ACs (unequal measurement of cases and controls); 3) find out whether antihistamine use interferes with protection against glioma afforded by ACs; and 4) determine whether AC polymorphisms affect glioma risk independently of their association with ACs. The innovation in the proposed study is to focus on polymorphisms associated with ACs, an epidemiologic risk factor that reduces glioma risk, rather than on polymorphisms associated with carcinogenesis as has been done in previous studies.      Our pilot study will make use of interviews with 260 glioma cases and 450 controls that have already been conducted and blood samples that have been collected in conjunction a population-based case-control study of mobile telephone use and brain tumors in Sweden. Study participants were asked whether they have been diagnosed with asthma, eczema, hay fever or other allergies, continue to have allergies, have symptoms of allergies without a diagnosis, and have used allergy medication. Twenty ml of blood from each participant was collected and stored in a -80 degree freezer and DNA preparation is ongoing. Each participant will be evaluated for the presence AC polymorphisms. Unconditional logistic regression will be used to estimate the association between AC polymorphisms and glioma risk.

"Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexually transmitted infections of the genital tract (STIs) and non-sexually transmitted infections of the urinary tract (UTIs) share common risk factors and presenting symptoms in women of reproductive age. Because adolescents constitute the age group at highest risk for STIs, the CDC recommends annual screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) in all sexually active (SA) adolescents, regardless of symptoms. Because the clinical presentations of CT, GC, Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), and UTI may be similar, many experts recommend interim testing for all four infections in SA adolescent females who have urinary symptoms. Despite these recommendations, there are important gaps between ideal and actual clinical practice. The availability of sensitive and specific, non-invasive tests for CT, GC, and TV may increase both routine and symptom-based STI screening of SA adolescents. However, important questions regarding the triage of symptomatic patients remain unanswered. The goal of the proposed study is to elucidate the association between STIs and UTIs in SA adolescent females. It focuses on the three STIs that are highly prevalent, likely to cause urinary symptoms, and detectable on tests of urine or patient-obtained vaginal samples. The study sample will consist of 474 SA adolescent females presenting to a hospital-based teen health center w/urinary symptoms (n=158) and w/o urinary symptoms (n=316). Each subject will be interviewed during the visit by a trained research assistant for chief complaint, genitourinary symptoms, sexual history, and past medical history. Prior to physical examination, each subject will provide a urine sample and a self-collected vaginal swab sample. The urine will be tested by ligase chain reaction for CT and GC and cultured for bacteria; the vaginal sample will be cultured for TV. The CT, GC and TV prevalence rates will be compared in subjects with and without urinary symptoms and in subjects with and without UTI, defined as over 1000 colonies of a single organism. Best subset logistic regression analyses will be performed to identify the variables that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have CT, GC, and/or TV, and the variable that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have UTIs. The findings of this study will strengthen the evidence base for symptom-based STI testing of SA adolescent females and will promote care that addresses both individual patient and public health needs.         n/a",Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?,6600325,R03AI054616,"['Chlamydia trachomatis', ' Trichomonas vaginalis', ' adolescence (12-20)', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' female', ' gonorrhea', ' human subject', ' interview', ' reproductive system infection', ' sexually transmitted diseases', ' sign /symptom', ' urinalysis', ' urinary tract infection', "" women's health""]",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL MED CTR (CINCINNATI),R03,2003,74500,-0.0019515072715885838
"JOB COMPLEXITY AND COGNITION IN OLDER TWIN PAIRS This proposal responds to research topic 12 (Cognition in Context), with secondary relevance to topic 19 (Genetics, Behavior and Aging). The aging of the U.S. population has stimulated public health interest in identifying factors that can preserve the cognitive functioning of older adults. Complex work may be one activity that has a salutary effect on late-life cognitive function, but factors like intelligence, educational level, and early environmental exposures are potential confounds to this association. Twin studies allow for control of many of these confounding factors. The goal of this project is to determine whether occupational complexity is associated with better late-life cognitive functioning in a sample of elderly twins, using data collected by the Duke Twins Study of Memory in Aging on members of the National Research Council-National Academy of Sciences (NAS-NRC) Registry of World War II veteran twins. Specific Aim 1 of this project is to classify each twin's primary lifetime occupation using the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), from which a measure of complexity can be derived. This allows additional Specific Aims (SA) to be tested using co-twin control analyses: (SA 2) estimate the association between occupational complexity and cognitive status, (SA 3) estimate the association between occupational complexity and change in cognitive status over time, and (SA 4) estimate the extent to which intelligence moderates the relationship between occupational complexity and cognitive status. The study sample, which comprises approximately 1000 monozygotic and 1000 dizygotic twin pairs, has been administered a cognitive status examination every 3-4 years since 1990 as part of a screening and assessment protocol for dementia. Approximately 300 of these pairs also have scores on standard armed services intelligence tests. Logistic regression dependent on twin pair will be used to estimate association between a factor-based measure of occupational complexity from the DOT and either baseline (SA 2) or change scores (SA 3) from the cognitive status measure. Analyses for SA 4 will be similar, using the intelligence test score as a covariate. If occupational complexity is found to enhance late-life cognitive functioning, this modifiable factor could inform cognitive interventions and influence decisions about occupational activities and retirement. Follow-up twin studies can explore whether complex work is a protective factor for dementia. n/a",JOB COMPLEXITY AND COGNITION IN OLDER TWIN PAIRS,6684283,R03AG022683,"['aging', ' clinical research', ' cognition', ' human data', ' human old age (65+)', ' intelligence tests', ' occupations', ' twin /multiplet', ' veterans']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R03,2003,77000,-0.02421897239631742

"MEDIC ONE STROKE SCALE As stroke therapies emerge, they will likely work better if given earlier after stroke onset.  This Patient-oriented Research Career Development Award proposal involves the design, implementation and validation of a prehospital stroke scale, the Medic One Stroke Scale (MOSS), with Dr. David Tirschwell as the principal investigator.  Dr. Tirschwell is a neurologist completing a Master's degree in epidemiology at the University of Washington and plans a career as a stroke clinical researcher and epidemiologist.  He will further his research training through study of issues surrounding the creation and validation of clinical measurement tools.  Dr. Tirschwell has been studying the prehospital care of stroke patients in Seattle, Washington in collaboration with members of the Departments of Neurology and Epidemiology and Seattle Medic One (fire department). The hypothesis is that this continued collaboration can produce a rapid, reliable, easy to use stroke evaluation tool for the prehospital setting that will facilitate accurate identification and efficient transport times for acute stroke patients.  A further hypothesis is that with this same tool, one can provide a useful early measure of stroke severity.  Two versions of the MOSS will be created, a cohort of patients evaluated with each, and Dr. Tirschwell will examine the patients at a 3-month follow-up visit to determine outcomes.  The first version (prediction) will record historical and clinical variables and evaluation and transport times.  The shorter second version (validation), incorporating only the most predictive variables, will be associated with diagnosis and triage algorithms to minimize transport time for the most urgent stroke cases.  The ease of use, reliability and predictive value of the MOSS will be validated in the second cohort and compared with the Glasgow Coma Scale and medical record abstracted NIHSS.  Diagnostic accuracy, transport times, proportion of ischemic stroke patients receiving tPA and outcomes will be compared between the first and second cohorts. As stroke therapeutic research moves into the prehospital setting, the MOSS will serve as a standardized evaluation tool allowing early and accurate stroke diagnosis and severity stratification.  n/a",MEDIC ONE STROKE SCALE,6655050,K23NS002119,"['artificial intelligence', ' automated medical record system', ' brain disorder chemotherapy', ' cerebral hemorrhage', ' cerebral ischemia /hypoxia', ' cerebrovascular disorder diagnosis', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' disease /disorder classification', ' disease /disorder onset', ' early diagnosis', ' health care service evaluation', ' health care transport service', ' health services research tag', ' hospital utilization', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' longitudinal human study', ' outcomes research', ' plasminogen activator', ' prognosis', ' rapid diagnosis', ' stroke', ' telecommunications', ' training']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2003,125010,0.014462927369800791
"Older Adults & Drug Decisions: Collaboration & Outcomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Midst growing time pressures on physicians, there is a need to maintain and even enhance the quality of physician-patient encounters, particularly for vulnerable, older adults with chronic conditions. Substantial research suggests that older adults are more passive than other age groups during their visits. Hence, physicians may miss key information about patient concerns and regimens that could affect health outcomes. This research addresses gaps identified by literature reviews calling for studies evaluating interventions that efficiently elicit patient pre-visit expectations for physicians and examine the longitudinal effect of expectation fulfillment on patient outcomes. The goal of this research is to study the impact of an intervention that identifies pre-visit concerns of older adult patients and then prompts both patients and physicians to address these concerns in the visit. Older adults' functional status concerns will be identified briefly in the waiting room using a handheld computer. A printout summarizing patient responses will be given both to the physician and patient. We hypothesize that this prompt will affect the nature of the patient-provider encounter in such a way that health outcomes will be improved. To test these hypotheses, a final sample of 580 patients age 60 or older, with a formal diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis will be enrolled at their clinic visit. A one-year randomized, controlled experiment will be used in which an experimental group patients receive a computerized assessment and prompt about their visit concerns while a control group receives a parallel placebo computerized assessment of their exercise patterns. In both cases, patient assessment summaries are given to the patients and to their physicians in the medical record. Baseline, 6 month and 12 month data will be collected on each patient. We hypothesize improved health status at 12 months for the primary outcomes of pain and physical function. Selected encounter dynamics hypothesized to help explain these outcomes will also be examined. We will audiotape patient-physician encounters to study these interaction dynamics. The primary analyses will examine differences at 12 months between the control and experimental groups using ANCOVA for continuous variables with baseline values of outcomes as a covariate, Dichotomous outcomes will be analyzed primarily by the Mantel Haenszel test and logistic regression.   n/a",Older Adults & Drug Decisions: Collaboration & Outcomes,6656940,R01AG018362,"['audiotape', ' clinical research', ' clinical trials', ' communication', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' drug screening /evaluation', ' functional ability', ' human old age (65+)', ' human subject', ' longitudinal human study', ' outcomes research', ' pain', ' patient care personnel relations', ' physicians', ' questionnaires', ' rheumatoid arthritis']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,R01,2003,150000,0.003835191742792602
"IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS The provision of critical care has changed markedly since its inception. Intensive care units (ICUs), developed to provide highly skilled care during a brief illness, now also provide care for substantial numbers of patients who require extended support due to inability to wean from mechanical ventilation (MV). ACUTE Care Nurse Practitioners (ACNP) are prepared to perform a wide range of nursing functions, as well as certain functions traditionally performed by physicians, including diagnosis, management, and interpreting diagnostic studies. These competencies make the ACNP an excellent candidate to test an intervention designed to facilitate recovery from critical illness. The primary aim of this study is to test ability of an ICU and in the post discharge period. The secondary aim is to identify factors which promote weaning progression and weaning success in this population. The study will use a 2 X 2 non-randomized, repeated measures, equivalent time- samples design. During the intervention, an ACNP will management subjects admitted to a SD-ICU, and provide consultation to these patients and their families for one month after discharge. Usual care subjects will be managed by physicians-in-training and followed for the same time period, but will not receive post discharge consultation. Dependent variables will be: 1) weaning progress (hours off full MV support); 2) recovery trajectory (rapid, shallow breathing ratio [f/Vt], pulmonary capillary wedge pressure estimated non-invasively [ePCWP], acute physiology and chronic health evaluation [APACHE] III scores; 4) information needs (Patient/Family Information Needs Scale); 5) ICU resource consumption (ratio of cost to charges); 6) health-related quality of life (Health Assessment questionnaire, Medical Outcomes Study SF- 36); 7) medical record documentation, and 8) disposition. Measures will be obtained at SD-ICU admission, when weaning occurs or the subject is discharged from the SD-ICU and 1, 6, and 12 months after discharge. During weaning trials, f/Vt and ePCWP will be also measured at 3-day intervals. Data will be analyzed using logistic regression, analysis of covariance, proportional hazards regression, and linear mixed effect models. To accomplish our Secondary Aims, we will construct weaning patterns for each subject, identify the proportion of weaning patterns which can be reliably differentiated as consistent weaning progress, and use stepwise multiple logistic regression to identify variables which predict weaning consistent progress, irrespective of group.  n/a",IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS,6640934,R01NR005204,"['artificial respiration', ' clinical research', ' critical care nursing', ' extended care', ' human subject', ' intensive care', ' managed care', ' nurse practitioners', ' outcomes research', ' respirators']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2003,357169,0.02088428449182609
"Common and specific risk factors for emotional disorders This is a collaborative research effort of Northwestern University and the University of California, Los Angeles to evaluate common and specific risk factors for anxiety disorders and depression.  Each site will work on a common protocol.  We propose a prospective longitudinal study of 700 high school juniors, recruited in two cohorts over consecutive years at two high schools (Evanston and Santa Monica).  Using a high-risk design, participants at high risk (according to Neuroticism cores) will be oversampled relative to medium and low risk groups.  Their progression will be carefully tracked over the course of 8 to 10 assessments staggered over four to four and a half years of data collection.  The participant sample will be geographically, ethnically, and socio-economically diverse.  The proposal takes a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach to the conceptualization and measurement of risk factors, which include Neuroticism, depressogenic cognitive style, anxiety sensitivity, introversion and low positive affectivity, sociotropy and autonomy.  Measures will include self report, parental report, as well as information processing tasks (modified Stroop, memory tasks), affective modulation of startle reactivity, and ambulatory cortisol assays.  In addition, diathesis-stress interactions will be evaluated on the basis of contextual assessment of chronic and episodic life stress.  Outcome will be measured in terms of symptoms and diagnosis of anxiety and depression.  Various models of commonalities and specificities of risk and their interaction with stress will be tested using hierarchical logistic regression and structural equation modeling.

"Optical Detection of Intravenous Infiltration  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): About 80% of hospital patients in the United States require IV therapy and 50% of IV lines fail due to infiltration, a clot in the cannula, an inflammatory response of the vein, or separation of the cannula from the vein. IV infiltration is usually accompanied by pain, erythema, and swelling at the cannula tip or the insertion site. Severe infiltration may lead to necrosis requiring skin debridement, skin grafting, or amputation. Early detection of infiltration prevents the occurrence of serious incidents that may require surgical correction. The long-term objective of this project is to develop an infiltration sensor for monitoring IV failures. The Phase II research design includes the development of an advanced prototype, improvement of algorithms, evaluation of the prototype on animal models and human measurements, investigation of its accuracy and utility, and the examination of the commercial potential. The innovation of this project lies in the use of an optical method coupled with the advanced development in fiber optics and algorithms for tissue optics to provide a means for noninvasive monitoring of the IV sites.

"CHILD ABUSE REPORTING EXPERIENCE STUDY (CARES)   The number of children who are maltreated each year in the US                      continues to increase. Despite this alarming statistic, primary care                 practitioners (PCPs)are not frequent reporters of suspected child abuse              (SCAN)to government child protection agencies (CPS). The reasons for this are        not yet understood. This proposed research will provide the first                    comprehensive description and analysis of the management of SCAN in primary          care practices.                                                                                                                                                           This study is a prospective descriptive study of practitioner management of          16,000 childhood injuries. Data will be collected in the Pediatric Research in       Office Setting (PROS)Network using a protocol that is derived from one that          was piloted in a regional practice-based research network (PBRN). Four hundred       PROS PCP will each gather information about 40 consecutive injury visits. They       will report medical diagnosis, demographic information, and their level of           suspicion for child physical abuse. Follow-up telephone calls to the PCP will        elicit further information about the management of these injuries. This data         will be used to construct vignettes. The response of a panel of child abuse          experts to these vignettes will be used to evaluate the PCP management of            suspected abuse and the rate of false positive and false negative reports to         CPS.                                                                                                                                                                      The data collected will be used to address the following specific aims               concerning the care of SCAN by PCPs: (1) Identify PCP related factors that           affect identification of maltreatment; (2) Identify PCP related factors that         affect management of any suspicious injuries; and, (3) Assess the validity of        PCP management of childhood injuries.

"An Expert System to Reduce Depression in Primary Care A variety of effective interventions exist for people who seek help for depression. However, there is a lack of effective interventions for individuals who do not seek help or follow through with treatment referrals. We propose to fill this gap in services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model-based intervention that will be delivered proactively, on a population basis, to primary care patients who are experiencing symptoms of depression but are not currently involved in treatment. It is the first intervention for depression that is appropriate for individuals in all stages of change-not merely the minority who are prepared to take action. In Phase I of this Fast Track Initiative, the aims are to norm TTM measures, develop the TTM interventions, and determine the feasibility of this approach by assessing study recruitment rates and reactions to the intervention materials. Primary care patients who screen positive for mild to moderate depression and are not involved in treatment will complete surveys for measurement norming (n=100) or participate in a pilot-test of the intervention materials (n=50). If feasibility conditions are met, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial in Phase II to assess the efficacy of the expert system intervention for depression. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Depression is a costly illness for health care organizations, disability insurers, and employers because of increased health service utilization, disability claims, and lost productively among depressed individuals.

"Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Most disasters are readily identifiable but health care disasters may not be as readily recognized, particularly early in their evolution. Syndromic surveillance, one kind of health care disaster, is the term coined for systems that use data that precede diagnosis to recognize disease outbreaks with sufficient specificity to warrant a public health response. Algorithms designed for early detection of health care disasters that rely solely on temporal trends may not be specific enough and several investigators have begun to incorporate geospatial clustering into the pattern recognition algorithms in order to improve specificity. Knowing the specific geographic location of the patient's home address would allow easy identification of a patient in many cases, however, we propose to develop and characterize pattern recognition algorithms that operate on deidentified data in order to protect patients' privacy. We will carry out this work using actual data from two different cities in order to increase the chance that the approach developed can be generalized. The overall approach would be to utilize established pattern recognition algorithms developed at Children's Hospital in Boston, and modify them as needed to accommodate use of deidentified data. Then we will compare the detection characteristics of the algorithm using identifiable data and deidentified data in order to determine the effect of using deidentified data. n/a",Syndromic Surveillance Data Exchange and Analysis,6673408,R21LM007970,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioterrorism /chemical warfare', ' clinical research', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' disasters', ' disease outbreaks', ' early diagnosis', ' geographic site', ' human data', ' human population study', ' public health']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R21,2003,606068,0.0015602075149596126

"Circadian Impact of Psychosocial Factors in Depression Relatively little work has explored the role of stress and social rhythms (i.e., daily routines) as they impact the circadian system in depression. The goal of this project is to investigate a theoretical model describing pathways by which social factors may be related to depression via their impact on circadian rhythms. After meeting screening criteria, 40 depressed and 40 normal control participants will complete a life events interview.  They will be given actillumes (devices which measure sleep/wake activity) and prospective, daily measures of social interactions and mood to complete over a 1-week period of time.  For both groups, linear regression will be used to predict social and circadian rhythms from social rhythm disruption (SRD) life events that have occurred within the past 4 months.  Cross-sectional analyses utilizing linear and logistic regression will investigate the relationship between circadian and social rhythms and circadian rhythms and depression.  It is predicted that individuals with depression are more sensitive and less adaptive to changes in their environment as compared to non-depressed subjects.  This project will increase our understanding of psychosocial and biological interactions involved in major depressive disorder.  In addition, this study is likely to enhance understanding of the validity of social rhythms as a construct.  This line of research may provide guidelines for addressing circadian factors when developing interventions. n/a",Circadian Impact of Psychosocial Factors in Depression,6445959,F31MH064255,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' bioperiodicity', ' body physical activity', ' circadian rhythms', ' clinical research', ' depression', ' emotions', ' human subject', ' interpersonal relations', ' interview', ' photobiology', ' predoctoral investigator', ' psychological adaptation', ' psychological stressor', ' psychological tests', ' psychometrics', ' questionnaires', ' sleep', ' social psychology']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO,F31,2002,25018,-0.014105896774831813

"Older Adults & Drug Decisions: Collaboration & Outcomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Midst growing time pressures on physicians, there is a need to maintain and even enhance the quality of physician-patient encounters, particularly for vulnerable, older adults with chronic conditions. Substantial research suggests that older adults are more passive than other age groups during their visits. Hence, physicians may miss key information about patient concerns and regimens that could affect health outcomes. This research addresses gaps identified by literature reviews calling for studies evaluating interventions that efficiently elicit patient pre-visit expectations for physicians and examine the longitudinal effect of expectation fulfillment on patient outcomes. The goal of this research is to study the impact of an intervention that identifies pre-visit concerns of older adult patients and then prompts both patients and physicians to address these concerns in the visit. Older adults' functional status concerns will be identified briefly in the waiting room using a handheld computer. A printout summarizing patient responses will be given both to the physician and patient. We hypothesize that this prompt will affect the nature of the patient-provider encounter in such a way that health outcomes will be improved. To test these hypotheses, a final sample of 580 patients age 60 or older, with a formal diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis will be enrolled at their clinic visit. A one-year randomized, controlled experiment will be used in which an experimental group patients receive a computerized assessment and prompt about their visit concerns while a control group receives a parallel placebo computerized assessment of their exercise patterns. In both cases, patient assessment summaries are given to the patients and to their physicians in the medical record. Baseline, 6 month and 12 month data will be collected on each patient. We hypothesize improved health status at 12 months for the primary outcomes of pain and physical function. Selected encounter dynamics hypothesized to help explain these outcomes will also be examined. We will audiotape patient-physician encounters to study these interaction dynamics. The primary analyses will examine differences at 12 months between the control and experimental groups using ANCOVA for continuous variables with baseline values of outcomes as a covariate, Dichotomous outcomes will be analyzed primarily by the Mantel Haenszel test and logistic regression.   n/a",Older Adults & Drug Decisions: Collaboration & Outcomes,6547472,R01AG018362,"['audiotape', ' clinical research', ' clinical trials', ' communication', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' drug screening /evaluation', ' functional ability', ' human old age (65+)', ' human subject', ' longitudinal human study', ' outcomes research', ' pain', ' patient care personnel relations', ' physicians', ' questionnaires', ' rheumatoid arthritis']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,R01,2002,150000,0.003835191742792602
"Optical Detection of Intravenous Infiltration  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): About 80% of hospital patients in the United States require IV therapy and 50% of IV lines fail due to infiltration, a clot in the cannula, an inflammatory response of the vein, or separation of the cannula from the vein. IV infiltration is usually accompanied by pain, erythema, and swelling at the cannula tip or the insertion site. Severe infiltration may lead to necrosis requiring skin debridement, skin grafting, or amputation. Early detection of infiltration prevents the occurrence of serious incidents that may require surgical correction. The long-term objective of this project is to develop an infiltration sensor for monitoring IV failures. The Phase II research design includes the development of an advanced prototype, improvement of algorithms, evaluation of the prototype on animal models and human measurements, investigation of its accuracy and utility, and the examination of the commercial potential. The innovation of this project lies in the use of an optical method coupled with the advanced development in fiber optics and algorithms for tissue optics to provide a means for noninvasive monitoring of the IV sites. It will provide routine, automated, continuous, and real-time monitoring capabilities for patients undergoing IV therapy.   n/a",Optical Detection of Intravenous Infiltration,6550261,R44HL062008,"['artificial intelligence', ' blood coagulation', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fiber optics', ' human subject', ' intravenous administration', ' medical complication', ' necrosis', ' optics', ' patient monitoring device', ' swine', ' technology /technique development']",NHLBI,"CW OPTICS, INC.",R44,2002,250708,-0.037089430209874125
"Common and specific risk factors for emotional disorders This is a collaborative research effort of Northwestern University and the University of California, Los Angeles to evaluate common and specific risk factors for anxiety disorders and depression.  Each site will work on a common protocol.  We propose a prospective longitudinal study of 700 high school juniors, recruited in two cohorts over consecutive years at two high schools (Evanston and Santa Monica).  Using a high-risk design, participants at high risk (according to Neuroticism cores) will be oversampled relative to medium and low risk groups.  Their progression will be carefully tracked over the course of 8 to 10 assessments staggered over four to four and a half years of data collection.  The participant sample will be geographically, ethnically, and socio-economically diverse.  The proposal takes a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach to the conceptualization and measurement of risk factors, which include Neuroticism, depressogenic cognitive style, anxiety sensitivity, introversion and low positive affectivity, sociotropy and autonomy.  Measures will include self report, parental report, as well as information processing tasks (modified Stroop, memory tasks), affective modulation of startle reactivity, and ambulatory cortisol assays.  In addition, diathesis-stress interactions will be evaluated on the basis of contextual assessment of chronic and episodic life stress.  Outcome will be measured in terms of symptoms and diagnosis of anxiety and depression.  Various models of commonalities and specificities of risk and their interaction with stress will be tested using hierarchical logistic regression and structural equation modeling.

"THE EFFECTS OF RETAINED LEAD BULLETS ON BODY LEAD BURDEN Numerous case reports have demonstrated lead poisoning with potentially fatal consequences can result from retained lead projectiles following firearm injuries.  To assess the impact of retained projectiles on subsequent lead exposure, one cannot rely on self-selected cases presenting with symptoms of lead intoxication.  The long-term goal of this project is to reduce the morbidity associated with body lead burden as a result of retained bullets from firearm injuries.  The proposed investigation seeks to identify risk factors of elevated blood lead levels for individuals with retained lead bullets, establish appropriate protocols for lead testing, develop indications for bullet removal and provide guidelines for the appropriate management of fragments not removed. The study design included follow-up of 300 patients with retained lead bullets/bullet fragments presenting for acute care of firearm injury at large publicly owned Level 1 Trauma Center.  A baseline blood level is measured as soon after patient stabilization as possible and repeated at intervals of 3, 6 and 12 months.  Medical history regarding prior firearms injuries and other retained projectiles is taken, along with a screening and risk factor questionnaire to determine other sources of lead (occupational/recreational) to which the patient might have been or at present be exposed.  The patient will have K- shell X ray florescence determination of bone lead in the tibia and calcaneus in order to determine past lead exposure not revealed by medical history and risk factor questionnairer.  Multivariate models of blood level are made for each patient visit using risk factor and bone lead concentration data.  Determinations will be made if changes in blood lead, adjusted for risk factors and bone lead concentration, from one 3 month period to the next can be significantly predicted by the coded location and fragmentation data of projectiles and presence or absence of fractures.  The variables of location, fragmentation, fracture and total time during which the projectile was retained in the body will be tested using logistic regression.  This will determine odds ratios of elevated lead at various concentrations (greater than 15 mug/dL, greater than 25  mug/dL, greater than 40 mug/dL, etc.) due to these factors.  Data will also be analyzed in the framework of the general linear model (GML), with a repeated measure design.  Principal interest will be in increasing trend of blood level as a function of fragmentation location, fracture and duration variables.  n/a",THE EFFECTS OF RETAINED LEAD BULLETS ON BODY LEAD BURDEN,6525222,R01ES010166,"['X ray', ' blood chemistry', ' clinical research', ' environmental exposure', ' foreign body reaction', ' human morbidity', ' human subject', ' injury', ' lead', ' lead poisoning', ' longitudinal human study', ' outcomes research', ' questionnaires', ' radiofluorescent probe', ' statistics /biometry']",NIEHS,CHARLES R.

"IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS The provision of critical care has changed markedly since its inception. Intensive care units (ICUs), developed to provide highly skilled care during a brief illness, now also provide care for substantial numbers of patients who require extended support due to inability to wean from mechanical ventilation (MV). ACUTE Care Nurse Practitioners (ACNP) are prepared to perform a wide range of nursing functions, as well as certain functions traditionally performed by physicians, including diagnosis, management, and interpreting diagnostic studies. These competencies make the ACNP an excellent candidate to test an intervention designed to facilitate recovery from critical illness. The primary aim of this study is to test ability of an ICU and in the post discharge period. The secondary aim is to identify factors which promote weaning progression and weaning success in this population. The study will use a 2 X 2 non-randomized, repeated measures, equivalent time- samples design. During the intervention, an ACNP will management subjects admitted to a SD-ICU, and provide consultation to these patients and their families for one month after discharge. Usual care subjects will be managed by physicians-in-training and followed for the same time period, but will not receive post discharge consultation. Dependent variables will be: 1) weaning progress (hours off full MV support); 2) recovery trajectory (rapid, shallow breathing ratio [f/Vt], pulmonary capillary wedge pressure estimated non-invasively [ePCWP], acute physiology and chronic health evaluation [APACHE] III scores; 4) information needs (Patient/Family Information Needs Scale); 5) ICU resource consumption (ratio of cost to charges); 6) health-related quality of life (Health Assessment questionnaire, Medical Outcomes Study SF- 36); 7) medical record documentation, and 8) disposition. Measures will be obtained at SD-ICU admission, when weaning occurs or the subject is discharged from the SD-ICU and 1, 6, and 12 months after discharge. During weaning trials, f/Vt and ePCWP will be also measured at 3-day intervals. Data will be analyzed using logistic regression, analysis of covariance, proportional hazards regression, and linear mixed effect models. To accomplish our Secondary Aims, we will construct weaning patterns for each subject, identify the proportion of weaning patterns which can be reliably differentiated as consistent weaning progress, and use stepwise multiple logistic regression to identify variables which predict weaning consistent progress, irrespective of group.  n/a",IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS,6490857,R01NR005204,"['artificial respiration', ' clinical research', ' critical care nursing', ' extended care', ' human subject', ' intensive care', ' managed care', ' nurse practitioners', ' outcomes research', ' respirators']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2002,430002,0.02088428449182609
"CHILD ABUSE REPORTING EXPERIENCE STUDY (CARES)   The number of children who are maltreated each year in the US                      continues to increase. Despite this alarming statistic, primary care                 practitioners (PCPs)are not frequent reporters of suspected child abuse              (SCAN)to government child protection agencies (CPS). The reasons for this are        not yet understood. This proposed research will provide the first                    comprehensive description and analysis of the management of SCAN in primary          care practices.                                                                                                                                                           This study is a prospective descriptive study of practitioner management of          16,000 childhood injuries. Data will be collected in the Pediatric Research in       Office Setting (PROS)Network using a protocol that is derived from one that          was piloted in a regional practice-based research network (PBRN). Four hundred       PROS PCP will each gather information about 40 consecutive injury visits. They       will report medical diagnosis, demographic information, and their level of           suspicion for child physical abuse. Follow-up telephone calls to the PCP will        elicit further information about the management of these injuries. This data         will be used to construct vignettes. The response of a panel of child abuse          experts to these vignettes will be used to evaluate the PCP management of            suspected abuse and the rate of false positive and false negative reports to         CPS.                                                                                                                                                                      The data collected will be used to address the following specific aims               concerning the care of SCAN by PCPs: (1) Identify PCP related factors that           affect identification of maltreatment; (2) Identify PCP related factors that         affect management of any suspicious injuries; and, (3) Assess the validity of        PCP management of childhood injuries.

"Nurse Staffing and Adverse Patient Outcomes A public concern pertaining to patient safety is that hospitals may currently be providing inadequate nurse staffing, consequently jeopardizing the quality of patient care. Recently, several studies have examined the relationship between nurse staffing and patient outcomes. Whereas these studies have produced empirical findings supporting this relationship, this study examines the cost-benefits of increasing nurse staffing as well as the nurse staffing-patient outcomes relationship. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to examine hospital characteristics that affect nurse staffing; (2) to examine the effects of nurse staffing on the occurrence of adverse events; (3) to assess the consequences of adverse events on morbidity, mortality and medical costs and decreased medical care costs due to decreases in adverse events as the benefits of increasing nurse staffing. A cross-sectional study design will be conducted using two existing databases of California acute care hospitals. Nurse staffing will be measured by six indicators, including nursing intensity-adjusted nursing hours per patient worked by registered nurses, all nursing personnel, and agency or contract personnel, skill mix, overtime index, and labor productivity. Adverse events include adverse drug events, patient falls, pressure ulcers, and nosocomial infections. These adverse events will be detected by using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision diagnosis codes. Morbidity attributed to adverse events will be indirectly measured by prolonged length of stay. Analyses will employ multiple regression, logistic regression, or mixed models, depending on the dependent variables. Patient characteristics will be controlled for to isolate the effects of nurse staffing on patient outcomes. The cost benefit analysis from the hospital perspective will examine whether the benefits of increasing nurse staffing are greater than its costs. This study will provide guidelines for determining appropriate nurse staffing levels in hospitals with differing characteristics, such as patient populations and types of care provided.  n/a",Nurse Staffing and Adverse Patient Outcomes,6352397,R03HS011397,"['accidental falls', ' clinical research', ' cost effectiveness', ' decubitus ulcer', ' health care cost /financing', ' health care facility information system', ' health services research tag', ' hospital analysis', ' hospital length of stay', ' hospital patient care', ' human data', ' human morbidity', ' human mortality', ' iatrogenic disease', ' nurse patient relations', ' nursing administration', ' nursing care quality', ' nursing personnel', ' outcomes research', ' patient safety /medical error', ' statistics /biometry']",AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2001,31116,-0.001027350385176321

"An Expert System to Reduce Depression in Primary Care A variety of effective interventions exist for people who seek help for depression. However, there is a lack of effective interventions for individuals who do not seek help or follow through with treatment referrals. We propose to fill this gap in services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model-based intervention that will be delivered proactively, on a population basis, to primary care patients who are experiencing symptoms of depression but are not currently involved in treatment. It is the first intervention for depression that is appropriate for individuals in all stages of change-not merely the minority who are prepared to take action. In Phase I of this Fast Track Initiative, the aims are to norm TTM measures, develop the TTM interventions, and determine the feasibility of this approach by assessing study recruitment rates and reactions to the intervention materials. Primary care patients who screen positive for mild to moderate depression and are not involved in treatment will complete surveys for measurement norming (n=100) or participate in a pilot-test of the intervention materials (n=50). If feasibility conditions are met, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial in Phase II to assess the efficacy of the expert system intervention for depression.

"COMPUTER ASSISTED SUPPORT FOR UNDER-SERVED SMOKERS DESCRIPTION:  The project goal is to continue development of a practical, easily usable software system (SCSS) to assist physicians in providing smoking cessation counseling to their patients who smoke.  This system, begun under a SBIR Phase-I program, provides on-line, real-time assessment of a patient's smoking history, nicotine dependence, and relevant variables, produces a feedback report to the patient and provides treatment guidelines for physicians.  An efficacy study will be used to examine the relative utility of this system compared to a low-cost control in an A-B-A design.  It is anticipated that utilization of the SCSS system will 1) increase rates of physician intervention in smoking cessation, and 2) increase quit attempts and cessation among patients.  Testing will occur in an inner-city primary care clinic serving low income and ethnic minority individuals.  Testing at secondary sites across the US will enhance representation of diverse ethnic groups.  Focus groups will be conducted to obtain feedback from physicians and representatives of healthcare management organizations.  Results will be used to finalize the software system and prepare collateral materials necessary for commercial production. Traditionally underserved populations are targeted as they present a challenge for treatment in that these have limited resources and access to preventive care.  n/a",COMPUTER ASSISTED SUPPORT FOR UNDER-SERVED SMOKERS,6376433,R44CA074624,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' health behavior', ' human subject', ' interactive multimedia', ' smoking cessation', ' tobacco abuse', ' tobacco abuse education']",NCI,"BOCK TO THE FUTURE, INC",R44,2001,180753,0.012665979454021209
"PERCEPTION OF RISK AND BEHAVIOR IN THE ELDERLY   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): This application was            initially submitted as an R29 FIRST Award, and is being re-submitted as an R01       in response to Program Announcement, PA-97-065 (NIA) entitled, ""Social               Cognition and Aging.""                                                                 The goal of this project is to determine how individual risk perceptions             influence health behaviors among the near-elderly (51-61) and decisions              regarding wealth holdings among the elderly (70+). Among the near-elderly, the       following health behaviors will be studied: the use of preventive services           (mammography, prostate screening, and cholesterol screening), weight loss and        exercise. The preventive services are designed to reduce mortality from cancer       and heart disease. Weight loss and exercise are both preventive measures as          well as mitigators of harm that results from health shocks. Expanding the use        of these preventive and mitigating measures are important to reduce morbidity        and mortality from heart disease and cancer. Among the elderly, the behavior of      interest relates to asset accumulation/dissaving, specifically focusing on           housing decisions. The specific decisions will be selling a house, and changes       in housing wealth holdings. The two decisions will be analyzed because housing       assets likely have fewer measurement errors, and because housing is the major        component of wealth for most elderly persons. Housing decisions are important        from a policy perspective because they may represent precautionary savings to        finance long-term care, a substantial risk the elderly face.                                                                                                              The proposed conceptual model is an extension of the common Bayesian learning        model whereby prior risk perceptions are updated on the basis of information.        Our model holds that updated risk perceptions, in turn, influence behavior.          Risk perceptions will be estimated as enodogenous explanatory variables              simultaneously with health behaviors among the near-elderly and housing              decisions among the elderly. The panel structure of the data bases to be used        (4 waves of Health and Retirement Study; 3 waves of Asset and Health Dynamics        Among the Oldest Old) will allow for the modeling of behaviors in time 3 or 4        as a function of changes in risk perceptions regarding longevity and of needing      nursing home care between waves 1 and 2 and 1 and 3.                                                                                                                      n/a",PERCEPTION OF RISK AND BEHAVIOR IN THE ELDERLY,6372233,R01AG015868,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' cholesterol', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' exercise', ' health behavior', ' health care service utilization', ' human middle age (35-64)', ' human subject', ' mammography', ' perception', ' prevention', ' prostate', ' socioeconomics', ' weight loss']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,181196,-0.020611775390113232
"DISTRIBUTED OCCUPATIONAL KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM Occupational health receives too little attention in primary care settings; in addition, public health surveillance acquires and utilizes too little of the information available in clinical settings.  Obtaining an appropriate occupational history requires both time and expert knowledge about occupational medicine, both of which are inadequate in most primary care settings.  The DOKS (Distributed Occupational Knowledge System addresses these problems by developing a computer assisted system, which may be directly incorporated in routine primary health care delivery. It obtains a computer assisted occupational history and makes case specific recommendations for preventive interventions.  It will also systematically collect clinical information for public health analysis.  The system will be implemented in three different health ambulatory care settings- county hospital based, health maintenance organization, and clinic group.  Initially, interviews will be in person, then by phone, and later by computer.  Recommendations are provided to patients and clinical care providers.  Evaluation includes historical and concurrent controls and is based on exit and 3 month interviews and record review.  The process also yields valuable surveillance data including population segments often missed by other methods and describing functional impact of work rather than just occupationally caused disease.  n/a",DISTRIBUTED OCCUPATIONAL KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM,6377932,R01CA086470,"['artificial intelligence', ' case history', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder prevention /control', ' human subject', ' information systems', ' occupational disease /disorder', ' patient care management']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2001,187587,0.011540908342594872
"NONINVASIVE ASSESSMENT OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Atrial arrhythmias are extremely common and are often associated with            significant morbidity and mortality. The ability to develop and                  prescribe new treatments for atrial arrhythmias depends on the                   availability of better diagnostic tools that are simple, inexpensive,            and effective enough to support their use for screening large numbers            of patients.                                                                                                                                                      During Phase I, we developed signal processing algorithms that permit            noninvasive assessment of patients suffering from atrial fibrillation.           T algorithms were tested on patient data and found to assist clinicians          in predicting patient response to cardioversion in an attempt to                 terminate the arrhythmia and restore sinus rhythm.                                                                                                                During Phase II, we will investigate alternate algorithms for                    identification and classification of atrial arrhythmias.

"TRAUMATIC GRIEF IN LATER-LIFE: CRITERIA, RISKS, OUTCOMES Symptoms of Traumatic Grief (TG) (e.g., yearning, searching, detachment, emptiness, futility) have been found to form a unified syndrome distinct from symptoms of depression and anxiety, to have risk factors, clinical correlates, and a response to pharmacotherapy distinct from depressive symptoms, to predict substantial morbidity (e.g., high blood pressure, suicidality), and to persist for years.  While these findings suggest the need for separate diagnostic criteria for TG, no standardized criteria exist.  The PI convened a panel of experts to formulate a criteria set for TG.  The primary aim of this proposal is to test the performance of the consensus criteria and to define parameters the panel left unspecified (e.g., determine the timing/duration criterion, number and severity of symptoms required for diagnosis).  A sample of 360 widowed subjects aged 65 years and older will be recruited into the study at 2 months post-loss.  The self-administered Inventory of Traumatic Grief (ITG) and the rater-administered Traumatic Grief Evaluation of Response to Loss (TRGR2L) structured interview will assess subjects on the proposed TG symptoms.  Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) and Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses will be used to develop optimally efficient diagnostic algorithms for TG.  Follow-up interviews at 6 and 15 months post-loss will provide information on symptom resolution over time, allow for a comparison of the morbidity associated with different temporal trajectories (e.g., chronic and delayed subtypes), and the determination of prevalence rates and temporal stability of a TG diagnosis over time.  Logistic regression models will estimate the effects of insecure and/or anxious romantic attachment styles, security-increasing marriages, and lack of social integration on the likelihood of meeting criteria for TG.  Random regression analyses will be used to estimate the effects of meeting criteria for TG on suicidality, and degree of impaired health and functioning.  Results will provide a validated diagnostic algorithm for TG derived from proposed consensus criteria, and psychometrically sound and clinically useful assessment tools for this disorder.   At-risk  individuals and potentially important foci for lay (social integration) and psychotherapeutic (e.g., treatment of attachment disturbances) intervention will be identified, as will the mental and physical health impairments associated with meeting diagnostic criteria for TG.  n/a","TRAUMATIC GRIEF IN LATER-LIFE: CRITERIA, RISKS, OUTCOMES",6392197,R01MH056529,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' bereavement', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder classification', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' functional ability', ' human morbidity', ' human old age (65+)', ' human subject', ' interview', ' mathematical model', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' outcomes research', ' psychometrics', ' psychosocial separation', ' sign /symptom', ' social integration', ' statistics /biometry', ' suicide', ' widowhood']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,242499,0.0005616087204243902
"A NON INVASIVE DERMATOLOGICAL LESION CLASSIFIER   Skin cancer is the fastest growing cancer. Approximately 34,100         Americans developed cutaneous melanoma in 1995; of the survivors, many must          contend with the ongoing trauma of disfigurement and fear. Skin biopsies are         now the most frequently performed medical procedure. It is axiomatic among           dermatologists that early detection and diagnosis are critical. Great strides        have been made in early detection of suspect skin lesions; however failure to        biopsy the right lesion has severe consequences. The dilemma is exacerbated          since 50- 80 percent of biopsies prove unnecessary, contributing to an enormous      waste of health care dollars, patient trauma and negative patient behavior           feedback. The Phase I work in dermatological spectroscopy and artificial neural      net technology suggest that an automated clinical diagnostic aid which produces      a quantitative rather than qualitative diagnostic assessment of skin lesions is      possible. This project proposes development and testing of such a product.           During Phase II a large number of spectroscopic samples of melanoma and nevi         will be used to complete development of an artificial neural net classifier.         Such a classifier system will lead to a commercial product to discriminate           ""normal,"" pre-cancerous and cancerous skin lesions.                                   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed project will lead to a non-invasive, in-office, real-time test to provide an  automated, repeatable diagnostic probability of the nature of skin lesions prior to biopsy.  Skin biopsies are now the most frequently performed reimbursed Medicare procedure,   and as many as 50-80% are found not to be necessary after the fact.  The low cost of   this test, and rapid amortization of the system, coupled with the enormous health care   cost savings possible in conjunction with a significant and widely recognized health   problem, suggest that this product could have great commercial potential.  n/a",A NON INVASIVE DERMATOLOGICAL LESION CLASSIFIER,6376769,R44CA078006,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence spectrometry', ' histology', ' human subject', ' neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' reflection spectrometry', ' skin neoplasms', ' spectrometry']",NCI,"WESTERN RESEARCH COMPANY, INC.",R44,2001,359255,-0.035270487122903454
"IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS The provision of critical care has changed markedly since its inception. Intensive care units (ICUs), developed to provide highly skilled care during a brief illness, now also provide care for substantial numbers of patients who require extended support due to inability to wean from mechanical ventilation (MV). ACUTE Care Nurse Practitioners (ACNP) are prepared to perform a wide range of nursing functions, as well as certain functions traditionally performed by physicians, including diagnosis, management, and interpreting diagnostic studies. These competencies make the ACNP an excellent candidate to test an intervention designed to facilitate recovery from critical illness. The primary aim of this study is to test ability of an ICU and in the post discharge period. The secondary aim is to identify factors which promote weaning progression and weaning success in this population. The study will use a 2 X 2 non-randomized, repeated measures, equivalent time- samples design. During the intervention, an ACNP will management subjects admitted to a SD-ICU, and provide consultation to these patients and their families for one month after discharge. Usual care subjects will be managed by physicians-in-training and followed for the same time period, but will not receive post discharge consultation. Dependent variables will be: 1) weaning progress (hours off full MV support); 2) recovery trajectory (rapid, shallow breathing ratio [f/Vt], pulmonary capillary wedge pressure estimated non-invasively [ePCWP], acute physiology and chronic health evaluation [APACHE] III scores; 4) information needs (Patient/Family Information Needs Scale); 5) ICU resource consumption (ratio of cost to charges); 6) health-related quality of life (Health Assessment questionnaire, Medical Outcomes Study SF- 36); 7) medical record documentation, and 8) disposition. Measures will be obtained at SD-ICU admission, when weaning occurs or the subject is discharged from the SD-ICU and 1, 6, and 12 months after discharge. During weaning trials, f/Vt and ePCWP will be also measured at 3-day intervals. Data will be analyzed using logistic regression, analysis of covariance, proportional hazards regression, and linear mixed effect models. To accomplish our Secondary Aims, we will construct weaning patterns for each subject, identify the proportion of weaning patterns which can be reliably differentiated as consistent weaning progress, and use stepwise multiple logistic regression to identify variables which predict weaning consistent progress, irrespective of group.  n/a",IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS,6343793,R01NR005204,"['artificial respiration', ' clinical research', ' critical care nursing', ' extended care', ' human subject', ' intensive care', ' managed care', ' nurse practitioners', ' outcomes research', ' respirators']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2001,416857,0.02088428449182609
"THE EFFECTS OF RETAINED LEAD BULLETS ON BODY LEAD BURDEN Numerous case reports have demonstrated lead poisoning with potentially fatal consequences can result from retained lead projectiles following firearm injuries.  To assess the impact of retained projectiles on subsequent lead exposure, one cannot rely on self-selected cases presenting with symptoms of lead intoxication.  The long-term goal of this project is to reduce the morbidity associated with body lead burden as a result of retained bullets from firearm injuries.  The proposed investigation seeks to identify risk factors of elevated blood lead levels for individuals with retained lead bullets, establish appropriate protocols for lead testing, develop indications for bullet removal and provide guidelines for the appropriate management of fragments not removed. The study design included follow-up of 300 patients with retained lead bullets/bullet fragments presenting for acute care of firearm injury at large publicly owned Level 1 Trauma Center.  A baseline blood level is measured as soon after patient stabilization as possible and repeated at intervals of 3, 6 and 12 months.  Medical history regarding prior firearms injuries and other retained projectiles is taken, along with a screening and risk factor questionnaire to determine other sources of lead (occupational/recreational) to which the patient might have been or at present be exposed.  The patient will have K- shell X ray florescence determination of bone lead in the tibia and calcaneus in order to determine past lead exposure not revealed by medical history and risk factor questionnairer.  Multivariate models of blood level are made for each patient visit using risk factor and bone lead concentration data.  Determinations will be made if changes in blood lead, adjusted for risk factors and bone lead concentration, from one 3 month period to the next can be significantly predicted by the coded location and fragmentation data of projectiles and presence or absence of fractures.  The variables of location, fragmentation, fracture and total time during which the projectile was retained in the body will be tested using logistic regression.  This will determine odds ratios of elevated lead at various concentrations (greater than 15 mug/dL, greater than 25  mug/dL, greater than 40 mug/dL, etc.) due to these factors.  Data will also be analyzed in the framework of the general linear model (GML), with a repeated measure design.  Principal interest will be in increasing trend of blood level as a function of fragmentation location, fracture and duration variables.  n/a",THE EFFECTS OF RETAINED LEAD BULLETS ON BODY LEAD BURDEN,6382333,R01ES010166,"['X ray', ' blood chemistry', ' clinical research', ' environmental exposure', ' foreign body reaction', ' human morbidity', ' human subject', ' injury', ' lead', ' lead poisoning', ' longitudinal human study', ' outcomes research', ' questionnaires', ' radiofluorescent probe', ' statistics /biometry']",NIEHS,CHARLES R.

"COMMUNITY-SITE CORONARY RISK CONTROL IN BLACK FAMILIES This study tests the effectiveness of Neighborhood Health Worker/Nurse           Case Management compared with usual care (referral to usual primary care         source) for the management of coronary heart disease risk factors in             African American siblings of persons with premature coronary disease.            Index patients with documented coronary disease prior to 60 years of age         will be recruited from 7 Baltimore hospitals to identify 480 siblings            to be screened to identify those with a criterion risk factor (LDL-              cholesterol greater than 130 mg/dl, blood pressure greater than 140/90           mmHg, and/or cigarette smoking) (n=433).  Eligible siblings are those            between 30 and 60 years of age with no known coronary disease.  Siblings         with criterion risk factors after screening will be randomly assigned            by family to receive care in the community by a case management team             consisting of a Neighborhood Health Worked guided by a nurse and                 cardiologist, or to receive usual care.  Siblings will be followed one           year after screening to determine the proportion in each group who meet          goal levels of blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, dietary fat, physical            activity, and smoking cessation.  The study builds on prior work in both         the African American community and in siblings that shows that 1.) nurse         managed care produces more successful risk reduction, 2.) African                Americans accept care in the community and from Neighborhood Health              Workers, and 3.) sociocultural models of care are more likely to be              successful in high risk African American families.  The goal is to               increase the proportion of high risk siblings who achieve goals based            on national guidelines.  This is one of the first studies to empirically         examine a combination of community intervention for multiple risk factor         reduction using indigenous workers and approaches which address the              needs of individuals with a documented family history of premature               coronary heart disease.

"CHILD ABUSE REPORTING EXPERIENCE STUDY (CARES)   The number of children who are maltreated each year in the US                      continues to increase. Despite this alarming statistic, primary care                 practitioners (PCPs)are not frequent reporters of suspected child abuse              (SCAN)to government child protection agencies (CPS). The reasons for this are        not yet understood. This proposed research will provide the first                    comprehensive description and analysis of the management of SCAN in primary          care practices.                                                                                                                                                           This study is a prospective descriptive study of practitioner management of          16,000 childhood injuries. Data will be collected in the Pediatric Research in       Office Setting (PROS)Network using a protocol that is derived from one that          was piloted in a regional practice-based research network (PBRN). Four hundred       PROS PCP will each gather information about 40 consecutive injury visits. They       will report medical diagnosis, demographic information, and their level of           suspicion for child physical abuse. Follow-up telephone calls to the PCP will        elicit further information about the management of these injuries. This data         will be used to construct vignettes. The response of a panel of child abuse          experts to these vignettes will be used to evaluate the PCP management of            suspected abuse and the rate of false positive and false negative reports to         CPS.                                                                                                                                                                      The data collected will be used to address the following specific aims               concerning the care of SCAN by PCPs: (1) Identify PCP related factors that           affect identification of maltreatment; (2) Identify PCP related factors that         affect management of any suspicious injuries; and, (3) Assess the validity of        PCP management of childhood injuries.

Siblings will be followed one           year after screening to determine the proportion in each group who meet          goal levels of blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, dietary fat, physical            activity, and smoking cessation.  The study builds on prior work in both         the African American community and in siblings that shows that 1.) nurse         managed care produces more successful risk reduction, 2.) African                Americans accept care in the community and from Neighborhood Health              Workers, and 3.) sociocultural models of care are more likely to be              successful in high risk African American families.  The goal is to               increase the proportion of high risk siblings who achieve goals based            on national guidelines.  This is one of the first studies to empirically         examine a combination of community intervention for multiple risk factor         reduction using indigenous workers and approaches which address the              needs of individuals with a documented family history of premature               coronary heart disease.  Analysis will include the test of proportions           achieving goals and multiple logistic regression analysis predicting             favorable change, adjusted for intra-family clustering of baseline risk          factors.                                                                          n/a",COMMUNITY-SITE CORONARY RISK CONTROL IN BLACK FAMILIES,6322626,R18HL058625,"['African American', ' blood lipoprotein', ' blood pressure', ' body physical activity', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention', ' cholesterol', ' clinical research', ' community health services', ' coronary disorder', ' diabetes mellitus', ' diet therapy', ' dietary lipid', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' health care referral /consultation', ' health care service availability', ' health services research tag', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' nutrition related tag', ' siblings', ' smoking cessation']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R18,2000,16710,0.003911827520407081
"MEDIC ONE STROKE SCALE As stroke therapies emerge, they will likely work better if given earlier after stroke onset.  This Patient-oriented Research Career Development Award proposal involves the design, implementation and validation of a prehospital stroke scale, the Medic One Stroke Scale (MOSS), with Dr. David Tirschwell as the principal investigator.  Dr. Tirschwell is a neurologist completing a Master's degree in epidemiology at the University of Washington and plans a career as a stroke clinical researcher and epidemiologist.  He will further his research training through study of issues surrounding the creation and validation of clinical measurement tools.  Dr. Tirschwell has been studying the prehospital care of stroke patients in Seattle, Washington in collaboration with members of the Departments of Neurology and Epidemiology and Seattle Medic One (fire department). The hypothesis is that this continued collaboration can produce a rapid, reliable, easy to use stroke evaluation tool for the prehospital setting that will facilitate accurate identification and efficient transport times for acute stroke patients.  A further hypothesis is that with this same tool, one can provide a useful early measure of stroke severity.  Two versions of the MOSS will be created, a cohort of patients evaluated with each, and Dr. Tirschwell will examine the patients at a 3-month follow-up visit to determine outcomes.  The first version (prediction) will record historical and clinical variables and evaluation and transport times.  The shorter second version (validation), incorporating only the most predictive variables, will be associated with diagnosis and triage algorithms to minimize transport time for the most urgent stroke cases.  The ease of use, reliability and predictive value of the MOSS will be validated in the second cohort and compared with the Glasgow Coma Scale and medical record abstracted NIHSS.  Diagnostic accuracy, transport times, proportion of ischemic stroke patients receiving tPA and outcomes will be compared between the first and second cohorts. As stroke therapeutic research moves into the prehospital setting, the MOSS will serve as a standardized evaluation tool allowing early and accurate stroke diagnosis and severity stratification.  n/a",MEDIC ONE STROKE SCALE,6186990,K23NS002119,"['artificial intelligence', ' automated medical record system', ' brain disorder chemotherapy', ' cerebral hemorrhage', ' cerebral ischemia /hypoxia', ' cerebrovascular disorder diagnosis', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' disease /disorder classification', ' disease /disorder onset', ' early diagnosis', ' health care service evaluation', ' health care transport service', ' health services research tag', ' hospital utilization', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' longitudinal human study', ' outcomes research', ' plasminogen activator', ' prognosis', ' rapid diagnosis', ' stroke', ' telecommunications', ' training']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2000,125010,0.014462927369800791
"PERCEPTION OF RISK AND BEHAVIOR IN THE ELDERLY   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): This application was            initially submitted as an R29 FIRST Award, and is being re-submitted as an R01       in response to Program Announcement, PA-97-065 (NIA) entitled, ""Social               Cognition and Aging.""                                                                 The goal of this project is to determine how individual risk perceptions             influence health behaviors among the near-elderly (51-61) and decisions              regarding wealth holdings among the elderly (70+). Among the near-elderly, the       following health behaviors will be studied: the use of preventive services           (mammography, prostate screening, and cholesterol screening), weight loss and        exercise. The preventive services are designed to reduce mortality from cancer       and heart disease. Weight loss and exercise are both preventive measures as          well as mitigators of harm that results from health shocks. Expanding the use        of these preventive and mitigating measures are important to reduce morbidity        and mortality from heart disease and cancer. Among the elderly, the behavior of      interest relates to asset accumulation/dissaving, specifically focusing on           housing decisions. The specific decisions will be selling a house, and changes       in housing wealth holdings. The two decisions will be analyzed because housing       assets likely have fewer measurement errors, and because housing is the major        component of wealth for most elderly persons. Housing decisions are important        from a policy perspective because they may represent precautionary savings to        finance long-term care, a substantial risk the elderly face.                                                                                                              The proposed conceptual model is an extension of the common Bayesian learning        model whereby prior risk perceptions are updated on the basis of information.        Our model holds that updated risk perceptions, in turn, influence behavior.          Risk perceptions will be estimated as enodogenous explanatory variables              simultaneously with health behaviors among the near-elderly and housing              decisions among the elderly. The panel structure of the data bases to be used        (4 waves of Health and Retirement Study; 3 waves of Asset and Health Dynamics        Among the Oldest Old) will allow for the modeling of behaviors in time 3 or 4        as a function of changes in risk perceptions regarding longevity and of needing      nursing home care between waves 1 and 2 and 1 and 3.                                                                                                                      n/a",PERCEPTION OF RISK AND BEHAVIOR IN THE ELDERLY,6169107,R01AG015868,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' cholesterol', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' exercise', ' health behavior', ' health care service utilization', ' human middle age (35-64)', ' human subject', ' mammography', ' perception', ' prevention', ' prostate', ' socioeconomics', ' weight loss']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,178725,-0.020611775390113232
"DISTRIBUTED OCCUPATIONAL KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM Occupational health receives too little attention in primary care settings; in addition, public health surveillance acquires and utilizes too little of the information available in clinical settings.  Obtaining an appropriate occupational history requires both time and expert knowledge about occupational medicine, both of which are inadequate in most primary care settings.  The DOKS (Distributed Occupational Knowledge System addresses these problems by developing a computer assisted system, which may be directly incorporated in routine primary health care delivery. It obtains a computer assisted occupational history and makes case specific recommendations for preventive interventions.  It will also systematically collect clinical information for public health analysis.  The system will be implemented in three different health ambulatory care settings- county hospital based, health maintenance organization, and clinic group.  Initially, interviews will be in person, then by phone, and later by computer.  Recommendations are provided to patients and clinical care providers.  Evaluation includes historical and concurrent controls and is based on exit and 3 month interviews and record review.  The process also yields valuable surveillance data including population segments often missed by other methods and describing functional impact of work rather than just occupationally caused disease.  n/a",DISTRIBUTED OCCUPATIONAL KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM,6174427,R01CA086470,"['artificial intelligence', ' case history', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder prevention /control', ' human subject', ' information systems', ' occupational disease /disorder', ' patient care management']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2000,187587,0.011540908342594872
"COMPUTER ASSISTED SUPPORT FOR UNDER-SERVED SMOKERS DESCRIPTION:  The project goal is to continue development of a practical, easily usable software system (SCSS) to assist physicians in providing smoking cessation counseling to their patients who smoke.  This system, begun under a SBIR Phase-I program, provides on-line, real-time assessment of a patient's smoking history, nicotine dependence, and relevant variables, produces a feedback report to the patient and provides treatment guidelines for physicians.  An efficacy study will be used to examine the relative utility of this system compared to a low-cost control in an A-B-A design.  It is anticipated that utilization of the SCSS system will 1) increase rates of physician intervention in smoking cessation, and 2) increase quit attempts and cessation among patients.  Testing will occur in an inner-city primary care clinic serving low income and ethnic minority individuals.  Testing at secondary sites across the US will enhance representation of diverse ethnic groups.  Focus groups will be conducted to obtain feedback from physicians and representatives of healthcare management organizations.  Results will be used to finalize the software system and prepare collateral materials necessary for commercial production. Traditionally underserved populations are targeted as they present a challenge for treatment in that these have limited resources and access to preventive care.  n/a",COMPUTER ASSISTED SUPPORT FOR UNDER-SERVED SMOKERS,6072500,R44CA074624,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' health behavior', ' human subject', ' interactive multimedia', ' smoking cessation', ' tobacco abuse', ' tobacco abuse education']",NCI,"BOCK TO THE FUTURE, INC",R44,2000,196068,0.012665979454021209
"NONINVASIVE ASSESSMENT OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Atrial arrhythmias are extremely common and are often associated with            significant morbidity and mortality. The ability to develop and                  prescribe new treatments for atrial arrhythmias depends on the                   availability of better diagnostic tools that are simple, inexpensive,            and effective enough to support their use for screening large numbers            of patients.                                                                                                                                                      During Phase I, we developed signal processing algorithms that permit            noninvasive assessment of patients suffering from atrial fibrillation.           T algorithms were tested on patient data and found to assist clinicians          in predicting patient response to cardioversion in an attempt to                 terminate the arrhythmia and restore sinus rhythm.

"TRAUMATIC GRIEF IN LATER-LIFE: CRITERIA, RISKS, OUTCOMES Symptoms of Traumatic Grief (TG) (e.g., yearning, searching, detachment, emptiness, futility) have been found to form a unified syndrome distinct from symptoms of depression and anxiety, to have risk factors, clinical correlates, and a response to pharmacotherapy distinct from depressive symptoms, to predict substantial morbidity (e.g., high blood pressure, suicidality), and to persist for years.  While these findings suggest the need for separate diagnostic criteria for TG, no standardized criteria exist.  The PI convened a panel of experts to formulate a criteria set for TG.  The primary aim of this proposal is to test the performance of the consensus criteria and to define parameters the panel left unspecified (e.g., determine the timing/duration criterion, number and severity of symptoms required for diagnosis).  A sample of 360 widowed subjects aged 65 years and older will be recruited into the study at 2 months post-loss.  The self-administered Inventory of Traumatic Grief (ITG) and the rater-administered Traumatic Grief Evaluation of Response to Loss (TRGR2L) structured interview will assess subjects on the proposed TG symptoms.  Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) and Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses will be used to develop optimally efficient diagnostic algorithms for TG.  Follow-up interviews at 6 and 15 months post-loss will provide information on symptom resolution over time, allow for a comparison of the morbidity associated with different temporal trajectories (e.g., chronic and delayed subtypes), and the determination of prevalence rates and temporal stability of a TG diagnosis over time.  Logistic regression models will estimate the effects of insecure and/or anxious romantic attachment styles, security-increasing marriages, and lack of social integration on the likelihood of meeting criteria for TG.  Random regression analyses will be used to estimate the effects of meeting criteria for TG on suicidality, and degree of impaired health and functioning.  Results will provide a validated diagnostic algorithm for TG derived from proposed consensus criteria, and psychometrically sound and clinically useful assessment tools for this disorder.   At-risk  individuals and potentially important foci for lay (social integration) and psychotherapeutic (e.g., treatment of attachment disturbances) intervention will be identified, as will the mental and physical health impairments associated with meeting diagnostic criteria for TG.  n/a","TRAUMATIC GRIEF IN LATER-LIFE: CRITERIA, RISKS, OUTCOMES",6186158,R01MH056529,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' bereavement', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder classification', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' functional ability', ' human morbidity', ' human old age (65+)', ' human subject', ' interview', ' mathematical model', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' outcomes research', ' psychometrics', ' psychosocial separation', ' sign /symptom', ' social integration', ' statistics /biometry', ' suicide', ' widowhood']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,279963,0.0005616087204243902
"A NON INVASIVE DERMATOLOGICAL LESION CLASSIFIER   Skin cancer is the fastest growing cancer. Approximately 34,100         Americans developed cutaneous melanoma in 1995; of the survivors, many must          contend with the ongoing trauma of disfigurement and fear. Skin biopsies are         now the most frequently performed medical procedure. It is axiomatic among           dermatologists that early detection and diagnosis are critical. Great strides        have been made in early detection of suspect skin lesions; however failure to        biopsy the right lesion has severe consequences. The dilemma is exacerbated          since 50- 80 percent of biopsies prove unnecessary, contributing to an enormous      waste of health care dollars, patient trauma and negative patient behavior           feedback. The Phase I work in dermatological spectroscopy and artificial neural      net technology suggest that an automated clinical diagnostic aid which produces      a quantitative rather than qualitative diagnostic assessment of skin lesions is      possible. This project proposes development and testing of such a product.           During Phase II a large number of spectroscopic samples of melanoma and nevi         will be used to complete development of an artificial neural net classifier.         Such a classifier system will lead to a commercial product to discriminate           ""normal,"" pre-cancerous and cancerous skin lesions.                                   PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed project will lead to a non-invasive, in-office, real-time test to provide an  automated, repeatable diagnostic probability of the nature of skin lesions prior to biopsy.  Skin biopsies are now the most frequently performed reimbursed Medicare procedure,   and as many as 50-80% are found not to be necessary after the fact.  The low cost of   this test, and rapid amortization of the system, coupled with the enormous health care   cost savings possible in conjunction with a significant and widely recognized health   problem, suggest that this product could have great commercial potential.  n/a",A NON INVASIVE DERMATOLOGICAL LESION CLASSIFIER,6143548,R44CA078006,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence spectrometry', ' histology', ' human subject', ' neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' reflection spectrometry', ' skin neoplasms', ' spectrometry']",NCI,"WESTERN RESEARCH COMPANY, INC.",R44,2000,363073,-0.035270487122903454
"IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS The provision of critical care has changed markedly since its inception. Intensive care units (ICUs), developed to provide highly skilled care during a brief illness, now also provide care for substantial numbers of patients who require extended support due to inability to wean from mechanical ventilation (MV). ACUTE Care Nurse Practitioners (ACNP) are prepared to perform a wide range of nursing functions, as well as certain functions traditionally performed by physicians, including diagnosis, management, and interpreting diagnostic studies. These competencies make the ACNP an excellent candidate to test an intervention designed to facilitate recovery from critical illness. The primary aim of this study is to test ability of an ICU and in the post discharge period. The secondary aim is to identify factors which promote weaning progression and weaning success in this population. The study will use a 2 X 2 non-randomized, repeated measures, equivalent time- samples design. During the intervention, an ACNP will management subjects admitted to a SD-ICU, and provide consultation to these patients and their families for one month after discharge. Usual care subjects will be managed by physicians-in-training and followed for the same time period, but will not receive post discharge consultation. Dependent variables will be: 1) weaning progress (hours off full MV support); 2) recovery trajectory (rapid, shallow breathing ratio [f/Vt], pulmonary capillary wedge pressure estimated non-invasively [ePCWP], acute physiology and chronic health evaluation [APACHE] III scores; 4) information needs (Patient/Family Information Needs Scale); 5) ICU resource consumption (ratio of cost to charges); 6) health-related quality of life (Health Assessment questionnaire, Medical Outcomes Study SF- 36); 7) medical record documentation, and 8) disposition. Measures will be obtained at SD-ICU admission, when weaning occurs or the subject is discharged from the SD-ICU and 1, 6, and 12 months after discharge. During weaning trials, f/Vt and ePCWP will be also measured at 3-day intervals. Data will be analyzed using logistic regression, analysis of covariance, proportional hazards regression, and linear mixed effect models. To accomplish our Secondary Aims, we will construct weaning patterns for each subject, identify the proportion of weaning patterns which can be reliably differentiated as consistent weaning progress, and use stepwise multiple logistic regression to identify variables which predict weaning consistent progress, irrespective of group.  n/a",IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS,6091418,R01NR005204,"['artificial respiration', ' clinical research', ' critical care nursing', ' extended care', ' human subject', ' intensive care', ' managed care', ' nurse practitioners', ' outcomes research', ' respirators']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2000,433046,0.02088428449182609
"THE EFFECTS OF RETAINED LEAD BULLETS ON BODY LEAD BURDEN Numerous case reports have demonstrated lead poisoning with potentially fatal consequences can result from retained lead projectiles following firearm injuries.  To assess the impact of retained projectiles on subsequent lead exposure, one cannot rely on self-selected cases presenting with symptoms of lead intoxication.  The long-term goal of this project is to reduce the morbidity associated with body lead burden as a result of retained bullets from firearm injuries.  The proposed investigation seeks to identify risk factors of elevated blood lead levels for individuals with retained lead bullets, establish appropriate protocols for lead testing, develop indications for bullet removal and provide guidelines for the appropriate management of fragments not removed. The study design included follow-up of 300 patients with retained lead bullets/bullet fragments presenting for acute care of firearm injury at large publicly owned Level 1 Trauma Center.  A baseline blood level is measured as soon after patient stabilization as possible and repeated at intervals of 3, 6 and 12 months.  Medical history regarding prior firearms injuries and other retained projectiles is taken, along with a screening and risk factor questionnaire to determine other sources of lead (occupational/recreational) to which the patient might have been or at present be exposed.  The patient will have K- shell X ray florescence determination of bone lead in the tibia and calcaneus in order to determine past lead exposure not revealed by medical history and risk factor questionnairer.  Multivariate models of blood level are made for each patient visit using risk factor and bone lead concentration data.  Determinations will be made if changes in blood lead, adjusted for risk factors and bone lead concentration, from one 3 month period to the next can be significantly predicted by the coded location and fragmentation data of projectiles and presence or absence of fractures.  The variables of location, fragmentation, fracture and total time during which the projectile was retained in the body will be tested using logistic regression.  This will determine odds ratios of elevated lead at various concentrations (greater than 15 mug/dL, greater than 25  mug/dL, greater than 40 mug/dL, etc.) due to these factors.  Data will also be analyzed in the framework of the general linear model (GML), with a repeated measure design.  Principal interest will be in increasing trend of blood level as a function of fragmentation location, fracture and duration variables.  n/a",THE EFFECTS OF RETAINED LEAD BULLETS ON BODY LEAD BURDEN,6195278,R01ES010166,"['X ray', ' blood chemistry', ' clinical research', ' environmental exposure', ' foreign body reaction', ' human morbidity', ' human subject', ' injury', ' lead', ' lead poisoning', ' longitudinal human study', ' outcomes research', ' questionnaires', ' radiofluorescent probe', ' statistics /biometry']",NIEHS,CHARLES R.

"COMMUNITY-SITE CORONARY RISK CONTROL IN BLACK FAMILIES This study tests the effectiveness of Neighborhood Health Worker/Nurse           Case Management compared with usual care (referral to usual primary care         source) for the management of coronary heart disease risk factors in             African American siblings of persons with premature coronary disease.            Index patients with documented coronary disease prior to 60 years of age         will be recruited from 7 Baltimore hospitals to identify 480 siblings            to be screened to identify those with a criterion risk factor (LDL-              cholesterol greater than 130 mg/dl, blood pressure greater than 140/90           mmHg, and/or cigarette smoking) (n=433).  Eligible siblings are those            between 30 and 60 years of age with no known coronary disease.  Siblings         with criterion risk factors after screening will be randomly assigned            by family to receive care in the community by a case management team             consisting of a Neighborhood Health Worked guided by a nurse and                 cardiologist, or to receive usual care.  Siblings will be followed one           year after screening to determine the proportion in each group who meet          goal levels of blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, dietary fat, physical            activity, and smoking cessation.  The study builds on prior work in both         the African American community and in siblings that shows that 1.) nurse         managed care produces more successful risk reduction, 2.) African                Americans accept care in the community and from Neighborhood Health              Workers, and 3.) sociocultural models of care are more likely to be              successful in high risk African American families.
