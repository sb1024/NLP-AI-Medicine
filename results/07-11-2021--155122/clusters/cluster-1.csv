"A portable photoacoustic imager for diagnosing vascular diseases Project Summary/Abstract Vascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Some common vascular diseases include: cardio vascular disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Many of these vascular diseases need point-of- care (POC) diagnosis and monitoring using non-ionizing, non-invasive and cost-effective approaches. Although Doppler ultrasound meets all these requirements, it only maps blood flow, which is operator dependent and influenced by motion artifacts, resulting in limited sensitivity and specificity to detect the disease in its early stage. A POC technique that provides direct label-free molecular and functional information of vasculature is needed to reliably detect and monitor vascular diseases.  A mobile photoacoustic imager (mPAI) is proposed for diagnosing various vascular diseases in resource poor settings of the world. Leveraging on strong multispectral optical absorption of oxy- and de-oxy hemoglobins, the mPAI is capable of providing multi-parametric information of deep vasculature, such as blood oxygen saturation, plaque lipids, blood flow and blood clot. The mPAI is non-invasive, real time and uses non-ionizing optical and ultrasound radiation. This will be the first and perhaps the only portable technology capable of deriving such multiparametric functional information of deep vasculature without the use of contrast agents. Competing technologies cannot provide such a direct information of vascular health, and certainly not in a compact portable device form. Health care providers can use the mPAI to instantly diagnose several vascular diseases affecting humans of all ages, including infants.  In the R21 phase, Aim1 will design and develop the mPAI, integrating the low-cost optical illumination and piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer (PMUT) arrays. Dr. Rundra Pratap team from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, will design and fabricate the PMUT arrays. Dr. Kothapalli team will develop the mPAI and validate its performance on tissue mimicking vascular phantoms in Aim 1, and rat models of PAD in Aim 2. The ultimate goal of the two-year R21 phase is to achieve a clinical grade mPAI device with reliable vascular imaging metrics.  In the R33 phase, to test the clinical performance of the mPAI, the following multicenter pilot clinical studies on PAD patients will be conducted in 1) Penn State Hershey medical center, 2) Vikram Hospital in India through collaborations with the IISc team, and 3) in Ghana in Year 5 with the help of Dr. Colette Pameijer of Penn State who conducts medical camps in Ghana every year through Penn State Global Health Program. Clinical studies in R33 phase will be undertaken only if well-defined milestones are achieved in the R21 phase.  The overall goal of these studies is to carefully validate the clinical potential of emerging label-free photoacoustic imaging technology to screen for vascular diseases, in a portable form, in resource poor settings of the world. Project Narrative Vascular diseases are becoming epidemic with increase in aging population, obesity and type II diabetes. They affect humans of all age groups, including neonates. This proposal aims to develop and validate the first ever portable photoacoustic imager for diagnosing and monitoring vascular diseases in resource poor settings.",A portable photoacoustic imager for diagnosing vascular diseases,10058614,R21EB030370,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Anticoagulants', 'Arteriovenous malformation', 'Award', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood flow', 'Brown Fat', 'Care Technology Points', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doppler Ultrasound', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Fiber Optics', 'Functional Imaging', 'Ghana', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hemangioma', 'Hematoma', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'India', 'Infant', 'Institutes', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lipids', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Multi-site clinical study', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Radiation', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Venous Insufficiency', 'absorption', 'age group', 'aging population', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'falls', 'global health', 'imager', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'in vivo', 'light scattering', 'miniaturize', 'neonate', 'next generation', 'older patient', 'phantom model', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'portability', 'preclinical study', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'time use', 'tissue phantom', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R21,2020,1000,-0.01750608220099359
"Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anxiety disorders in youth are highly prevalent [1] and impairing [2-4]. Left untreated, these disorders confer substantial additional risk for the development of a wide range of negative sequelae, including substance use [5], suicidal ideation and attempts [6], and additional mental health comorbidities [7]. Although several treatments have demonstrated efficacy for anxiety in youth, including individual cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), family CBT (FCBT), medication (MED), and combination of CBT and medication (COMB) [8], a meaningful portion of youth are classified as non-responders after a full course of treatment [9]. The identification of baseline predictors and moderators of response is critical to improve treatment efficacy and reduce burden on families. Increased anxiety severity, comorbidity (behavioral problems, depression), and family psychopathology, along with older age, female gender and anxiety diagnosis, have been highlighted as potential predictors and moderators of outcome. However, studies have been underpowered and findings are inconsistent [10]. To date, all studies have taken a traditional analytic approach, which typically provides conservative estimates as a result of imposed explanatory constraints [11]. Machine Learning (ML) represents a promising complementary statistical technique to traditional analyses, given its focus on predictive fit rather than explanatory inference [12] and will facilitate identification of non-linear, complex patterns of predictors and moderators at the individual level [13, 14]. These methods have shown promise in identification of treatment outcome predictors in other medical [e.g., 15-18] and psychiatric samples [e.g., 19-22], but to date have not been implemented in a sample of anxious youth. The proposed project will aggregate datasets from at minimum ten peer-reviewed and published randomized controlled trials (N=1444) and train and validate two models along overlapping features, including (1) demographics, (2) diagnosis, (3) anxiety severity (4) behavioral problems, and (5) family psychopathology. Models will also be used to examine differential response to ICBT, FCBT, MED and COMB. Aggregated data will be uploaded into a centralized dataset, in line with the NIMH RDoC db and NDAR [23] datasets, and then used to predict outcome for individual anxious youth (N=80) completing ICBT and COMB at the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple. The aims of this study are consistent with calls issued in the NIMH strategic plan (Objective 3) and will help facilitate the development of person-centered interventions for anxious youth [24]. An individualized approach to treatment is important to further increase treatment efficacy and reduce the financial and emotional burden associated with non-response [25, 26]. A training plan has been designed that consists of mentorship, formal classwork and experiential learning to develop the applicant's expertise in machine learning and dataset aggregation. The proposed study will take place within Temple University's clinical psychology program, which has a successful track record of conducting impactful NIMH-funded research and training research scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although several efficacious treatments have been identified for youth anxiety, there is significant heterogeneity in treatment response and this heterogeneity is poorly understood. To help clarify differences in treatment response and facilitate the development of person-centered interventions, novel and advanced statistical approaches should be implemented using adequately powered datasets. The proposed study will (1) use machine-learning methods to identify predictors and moderators of outcome in an aggregated dataset of at minimum ten Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) examining youth anxiety treatments (individual and family cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, and combination treatments), (2) create a centralized dataset of aggregated RCTs to foster continued cross-site collaboration and (3) test the model's predictive accuracy at the individual level in a real-world sample.",Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth,9990935,F31MH123038,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Youth', 'active method', 'anxiety treatment', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'childhood anxiety', 'clinical decision-making', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'demographics', 'depression model', 'design', 'expectation', 'family burden', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individual variation', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'parental role', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'social anxiety', 'treatment response']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,F31,2020,33509,-0.016751305894848623
"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9944489,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-aphasic', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2020,39939,-0.08906768154142185
"CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients Project Summary/Abstract While artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are becoming widely used throughout medicine, the analysis of the cost of an ML model’s predictions has been very limited. For example, an ML model may accurately predict that a trauma patient will have acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC), a bleeding disorder; however, it may heavily rely on hard-to-measure patient features, like blood pressure or Glasgow Coma Score, to do so. Standard ML techniques do not prioritize timely diagnosis, which is key to minimize death and injury. This idea, which we refer to as cost-aware prediction, is a topic of recent interest in machine learning. However, existing methods have substantial limitations, and their clinical impact has not been demonstrated. This proposal will adopt recent advances in ML and explainable AI to 1) develop improved cost-aware prediction techniques. 2) demonstrate their value using clinical data and 3) integrate them into the electronic medical record. These methods will be applicable in many areas of science and medicine. Aim 1. Develop a novel feature importance-based approach for cost-aware prediction. No existing approach for cost-aware prediction consistently outperforms the others, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. This proposal uses recent discoveries in machine learning to design a new algorithm, CoAI, with new strengths and fewer weaknesses. CoAI will substantially improve predictive performance, enable analysis on large datasets, and flexibly work with any ML model. Preliminary results show that CoAI can outperform existing methods. A new public benchmark for cost-aware prediction will be created and used to compare CoAI to existing methods, and CoAI will be published as easy-to-use open-source software. Aim 2. Evaluate CoAI’s potential for clinical time savings. CoAI’s ability to predict bleeding disorders will be tested on an unprecedentedly detailed dataset that combines trauma hospital data with surveys of doctors and paramedics. Comparing CoAI to the risk scores used in clinical practice will provide explicit estimates of how much time CoAI can save and how many misdiagnoses it can prevent. In preliminary analysis with trauma registry data, CoAI reduces prediction time and increases accuracy relative to an existing risk score. Aim 3. Incorporate an interactive ML method into the medical record. CoAI will be integrated into the electronic medical record (EMR), using feedback from professional paramedics. Quantitative estimates of time and cost savings and subjective impressions will be gathered from paramedics, and open-ended interviews will be conducted to assess their feelings about interactive machine learning methods like CoAI. These insights will guide future research in interactive machine learning methods, as well as possible clinical work to study CoAI’s impact on decision making in simulated trauma scenarios.  Successful completion of this project will allow faster, more accurate diagnosis of acute illness and advance the state of the art in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Project Narrative Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming an integral part of healthcare, from automatic radiology reading and triage to early-warning systems that detect adverse events during surgery. Until recently, AI systems have not been optimized to rely on data that can be gathered quickly or easily. We believe developing AI systems that can intelligently minimize the cost their use imposes on health care providers will lead to more efficient patient risk prediction and diagnosis, and will ultimately save lives.",CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients,9907467,F30HL151074,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Pressure', 'Budgets', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coma', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Cost Analysis', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Future', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Triage', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data registry', 'design', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'impression', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient registry', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'theories', 'time use', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F30,2020,41178,0.00549668055687673
"Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium ABSTRACT This proposal seeks funding to support a symposium, Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology (ABI), which will bring together recognized world experts in clinical, research, vision science, engineering, industrial and pharmaceutical communities as well as junior investigators (i.e., young faculty and those in training) to discuss the current state of ABI, ranging from bioelectronic implantable and wearable devices, to nanoscale scaffolds for stem cell and gene therapies. Given the multidisciplinary nature of this field, it is essential to bring together researchers and clinicians with varying levels of expertise across many domains related to ABI to advance the progress of this novel field, identify challenges of advancement, and develop a strategic action plan to overcome these challenges. The timing to have such a symposium to further the application of implantable and/or wearable bioengineered systems in ophthalmology is now as we focus on precision and personalized medicine and leverage the revolution in deep learning artificial intelligence algorithms. Through symposium talks, sessions, and discussions we will cover the fundamentals and also identify innovative and cutting-edge strategies and methodologies to accelerate the rate of major discoveries and development of novel therapeutics. The specific aims of this symposium are: Specific Aim 1. To bring together both established and junior investigators representing a broad range of disciplines to discuss cutting edge research in this novel field, catalyze the development of cross-disciplinary and translational approaches to advance abiotic-biotic interfaces for ophthalmology, and identify gaps in knowledge and barriers to advancement. We will identify research questions and develop an agenda to guide future research that is consistent with the objectives and interests of NEI. Specific Aim 2. Develop a junior investigator program to motivate a diverse group of students and junior investigators to pursue research careers in vision science and ophthalmologic therapeutic development, who will ultimately submit grant proposals to NEI solicitations and contribute to the scientific literature. Specific Aim 3. Develop a strategic action plan to set priorities for future studies that will encourage inter-agency collaborations (e.g., NEI, NSF, DARPA, etc.). This is critical because often certain engineering tasks are best suited to be supported by NSF or DARPA whereas the biological testing of the engineered systems lends itself to funding from NEI. Hence such inter-agency or cross-agency efforts can help leverage the funding to develop sophisticated abiotic-biotic systems NARRATIVE This meeting is the first on this topic dedicated to the broad use of implantable and/or wearable bioelectronics for ophthalmological applications. It is anticipated that the strategic action plan will significantly impact the field by greatly accelerating the translation of basic science and engineering research findings to stimulate the development of novel treatments and improve clinical practice. Key topics include visual restoration, drug and gene delivery, and sensing intraocular pressure. This meeting will foster training and development of future leaders in this emerging field and promote collaboration and exchange of knowledge and ideas among junior and established investigators.",Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium,10070800,R13EY031988,"['Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Testing', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contact Lenses', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Delivery', 'Glass', 'Industrialization', 'Intraocular lens implant device', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Neural Retina', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Senior Scientist', 'Students', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Virtual and Augmented reality', 'Visual', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'gene therapy', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoscale', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'restoration', 'scaffold', 'stem cell therapy', 'symposium', 'therapeutic development', 'translational approach', 'vision science', 'wearable device']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R13,2020,42465,0.004821186370139696
"Health Inequality and a Machine Learning-Based Tool for Emergency Department Triage: A Mixed Methods Approach Project Summary There is growing evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies like machine learning (ML) can perpetuate or even worsen social inequalities when deployed into real-world settings. This has been demonstrated in many realms, including policing, the court system, banking, social services provision, and there is growing concern the same is true in medicine. At the same time, there has been an outpouring of new AI-based interventions, with a ten-fold increase in the number of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for AI-based technologies since 2017. However, little research empirically examines the health equity implications of ML-based clinical decision-making tools. One clinical arena in which ML-based tools are already in use is emergency department (ED) triage, as an alternative to the common Emergency Severity Index (ESI) system. Despite its widespread popularity, evidence has shown that ESI-based triage has many problems, including poor acuity discrimination, with up to 50% of patients triaged at the midpoint of the scale, and is associated with racial inequalities, with African-American patients experiencing longer wait-times and lower triage levels controlling for illness severity. This study will use an ML-based ED triage tool that is already in use at a major academic medical center in the United States to explore the extent to which several factors are associated with inequality in predictive performance across patient racial/ethnic groups. This research will take a mixed methods approach to concurrently examine both human and ‘machine’ elements that affect the triage tool’s final impact on patients. Aim 1 will be a qualitative study involving ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviewing of triage nurses, to develop a conceptual framework for clinicians’ understanding of and interaction with an ML-based tool. Aim 2 will examine ‘label bias’, a type of measurement bias. The Applicant will use synthetic and real electronic health record (EHR) data and simulate different levels of label bias, then examine predictive performance of the triage tool across patient racial/ethnic groups. Aim 3 will explore different methods for imputing missing EHR data. The Applicant will deploy common, simplistic deletion-based methods as well as a promising new ML-based imputation method called an autoencoder, apply the triage model to generate predictions and examine performance across patient racial/ethnic groups. This project is innovative because it contributes to the development of a ‘life cycle’ model of ML-based tools and their health equity implications using a mixed methods approach that integrates both human and computational elements, while also providing a rigorous training plan for the Applicant, an MD-PhD student in epidemiology. This training plan is rigorous, synergistic yet diverse, and will include advanced coursework, dedicated 1-on-1 and group mentoring with experts in the field, attendance at seminars and targeted conferences, integration with clinical education and professional development. This project will be an essential step toward the Applicant’s maturation into an independent physician-scientist. Project Narrative This proposal represents a significant contribution to public health in that it seeks to improve upon current emergency department (ED) triage processes, which are associated with racial inequalities in wait time and triage severity. Specifically, this research will evaluate the performance of an alternative machine learning (ML) -based tool for ED triage across racial/ethnic groups, contributing to a more accurate and equitable triaging of patients and directly improving patient health outcomes. More broadly, this project will enhance the ability of many stakeholders, including data scientists, clinicians, researchers and health policy-makers to evaluate the health equity impacts of any proposed ML-based interventions for health.",Health Inequality and a Machine Learning-Based Tool for Emergency Department Triage: A Mixed Methods Approach,9992378,F31LM013403,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Ethnography', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Police', 'Policy Maker', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Service provision', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Work', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Variant', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'artificial neural network', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer science', 'court', 'deep learning', 'doctoral student', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health equity', 'health inequalities', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'social', 'social bias', 'social inequality', 'symposium', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,50520,0.003238379839629462
"SCH: INT: Computational Tools for Avoidaint/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder  Intellectual Merit: This project will for the first time provide the fundamental tools to integrate unique multimodal data toward screening, diagnosis, and intervention in eating disorders, with an initial focus on children with ARFID and related developmental and health disorders. This work is critical for enriching the understanding of healthy development and for broadening the foundations of behavioral data science. ARFID ·motivates the development of new computer vision and data analysis tools critical for the analysis of multidimensional behavioral data. The main aims are: 1. Develop and user individualized and integrated continuous facial affect coding from videos to discern affective motivations for food avoidance, critical due to the unique sensory aspects of eating disorders, and resulting from active stimulation via friendly and carefully designed images/videos and real food presentation; 2. Use data analysis and machine learning to derive sensory profiles based on patterns of food consumption and preference from existing unique datasets of selective eaters; and 3. Translate the tools developed in Aims 1 and 2 into the clinic and home to assess the capacity of these tools to define a threshold of clinically significant food avoidance, to detect change in acceptability of food with repeated presentations, and to examine and modify the accuracy of our food suggestion algorithms. Broader Impacts: The impact of this application comprises two broad domains. First is the derivation of processes, tools, and strategies to analyze very disparate data across multiple levels of analysis and to codify those strategies to inform similar future work, in particular incorporating automatic behavioral coding. Second is the exploitation of these tools to address questions about the emergence of healthy/unhealthy food selectivity across the lifespan, including recommendation delivery via apps and at-home recordings. The health impact of even partial success in this project is very broad and significant. Undergraduate students will be involved in this project via the 6-weeks summer research program at the Information Initiative at Duke, a center dedicated to the fundamentals of data science and its applications; via the co-Pl's research lab devoted to eating disorders; and via the Pl's project dedicated to training undergraduate students to address eating disorders of their friends via an anonymous app. Outreach and dissemination will follow the broad use of the developed app, both in the clinic and the general population, including the Pl's connections with low-income and under-represented bi-lingual preK. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Eating disorders are potentially life-threatening mental illnesses affecting the general population; -90% of individuals never receive treatment, in part due to lack of awareness and access.

"DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation Contact PD/PI: Fereidouni, Farzad Abstract Kidneys, like other organs, have an inherent capacity to recover from acute injury; however, severe or recurrent injury can result in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the sequelae of which result in 82,000 deaths annually in the US alone. Regardless of the etiology of the initial injury, the common final pathway leading to- end stage renal disease is closely connected to fibrosis(excess or aberrant collagen distribution), one of the most important determinants of renal disease severity and prognosis. Histology is the gold standard for evaluation, typically through the use of histochemical stains such as trichrome and PAS that highlight the presence of collagens and basement membrane, respectively. Nevertheless, these stains are not completely specific, can be technically challenging to perform well and reproducibly, and thus contribute to interobserver variability and a concomitant decrease in diagnostic precision. Moreover, they also require the preparation of extra slides and additional staining procedures, and thus increase cost and can prolong the diagnostic process. We propose to optimize, deploy and test a new kind of microscope, DUET (DUal mode Emission and Transmission microscopy), developed at UC Davis, that will be a low-cost and very rapid solution for detection and digital characterization of the presence and distribution of collagen and other macromolecules, directly from standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Specifically, we will finalize the design of the hardware and software components of the instrument itself, validate imaging performance against standard histology and immunohistochemical stains for collagen and other components, and with the assistance of scientists at our partnering institutions (John Hopkins University and University of Buffalo) develop robust tools for analysis and quantitation of fibrosis. DUET instrument hardware will be shared with JHU to ensure that the methods are technically reproducible across multiple sites. The application leverages the expertise across three institutions in optics, biomedical engineering, renal pathology and novel artificial intelligence approaches. The goal of the project is development and validation of DUET, which promises to be a robust, inexpensive and practical approach for the rapid and accurate evaluation of fibrosis, extensible to other renal pathologies, and indeed across other organs systems, with significant positive impact on disease research, clinical practice, and patient outcomes. Page 6 Project Summary/Abstract Project Narrative Evaluation of fibrosis and tubular atrophy from chemically stained kidney biopsies are essential for diagnosis and disease-severity assessment, but current techniques are time-consuming, somewhat non-specific and contribute to interobserver variability and imprecision, affecting care. We propose to optimize and test a new kind of microscope (“DUET”) that can visualize fibrosis (scarring) and other tissue abnormalities directly from standard slides to enable high-quality reproducible fibrosis scoring and evaluation. This multi-site project will also provide a unique opportunity to perform a retrospective study from hundreds of existing H&E slides with associated months to years of clinical follow-up data, and to create a method with demonstrated utility in more than one institution.",DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation,10261643,R56DK124873,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Basement membrane', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Buffaloes', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrillar Collagen', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Natural History', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirius Red F3B', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Trichrome stain method', 'Tubular formation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'follow-up', 'histological stains', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney fibrosis', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'software development', 'stem', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R56,2020,91725,-0.008977588780273186
"Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records ABSTRACT: There are nearly 7,000 diseases that have a prevalence of only one in 2,000 individuals or less. Yet, such rare diseases are estimated to collectively affect over 300 million people worldwide, representing a significant healthcare concern. Although rare diseases have predominantly genetic origins, nearly half of them do not manifest symptoms until adulthood and frequently confound discovery and diagnosis. Even in the case of early onset disorders, the sheer number of possible diagnoses can often overwhelm clinicians. As a result, rare diseases are often diagnosed with delay, misdiagnosed or even remain undiagnosed, not only disrupting patient lives but also hindering progress on our understanding of such diseases. Data science methods that mine large-scale retrospective health record data for phenotypic information will aid in timely and accurate diagnoses of rare diseases, especially when combined with additional data types, thus, having significant real- world impact. This proposal will integrate electronic health record (EHR) data sets with publicly available vocabularies and ontologies, and genomic data for the improved identification and characterization of patients with rare diseases, using approaches from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and basic bioinformatics. The work has three specific aims and will be carried out in two phases. During the mentored phase, the principal investigator (PI) will develop data-driven methods to extract standardized concepts related to rare diseases from clinical notes and infer the occurrence of each disease (Aim 1). He will also develop data science approaches to compare and contrast longitudinal patterns associated with patients' journeys through the healthcare system when seeking a diagnosis for a rare disease, and aid in clinical decision-making by leveraging these patterns (Aim 2). During the independent phase (Aim 3), computational methods will be developed for the integrated modeling and analysis of genotypic (from Aim 3) and phenotypic information (from Aims 1 and 2). Cohorts to be sequenced will cover diseases for which causal genes or disease definitions are unclear (discovery), as well as those for which these are well known (validation). This work will be carried out under the mentorship of four faculty members with complementary expertise in biomedical informatics, data science, NLP, and rare disease genomics at the University of Washington, the largest medical system in the Pacific Northwest (four million EHRs), world-renowned researchers in medical genetics, and a robust data science environment. In addition, under the direction of the mentoring team, the PI will complete advanced coursework, receive training in translational bioinformatics and clinical research informatics, submit manuscripts, and seek an independent research position. This proposal will yield preliminary results for subsequent studies on data-driven phenotyping and enable the realization of the PI's career goals by providing him with the necessary training to build on his machine learning and basic bioinformatics expertise to transition into an independent investigator in biomedical data science. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare genetic diseases are estimated to affect the lives of 25 to 30 million Americans and their families, and present a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Currently, our knowledge of the broad spectrum of the 7,000 observed rare diseases is limited to a few well-studied ones, hindering our ability to make correct and timely diagnoses. The objective of this study is to improve the identification of patients with rare diseases in healthcare systems by developing data science approaches that automatically recognize rare disease-related patterns in patient health records and correlate them with genomic data, thus, aiding in diagnosis and discovery.",Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records,9884791,K99LM012992,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Washington', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease phenotype', 'early onset disorder', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'member', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient health information', 'phenotypic data', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'rare condition', 'rare genetic disorder', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,92070,-0.01343462897466498
"Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Candidate: With my multidisciplinary background in Artificial Intelligence (PhD), Public Health Informatics (MS), Epidemiology and Health Statistics (MS), and Preventive Medicine (Bachelor of Medicine), my career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Biomedicine, with a particular emphasis initially in machine learning and public health. Training plan: My K99/R00 training plan emphasizes machine learning, deep learning and scientific communication skills (presentation, writing articles, and grant applications), which will complement my current strengths in artificial intelligence, statistics, medicine and public health. I have a very strong mentoring team. My mentors, Drs. Michael Becich (primary), Gregory Cooper, Heng Huang, and Michael Wagner, all of whom are experienced with research and professional career development. Research plan: The research goal of my proposed K99/R00 grant is to increase the re-use of computable biomedical knowledge, which is knowledge represented in computer-interpretable formalisms such as Bayesian networks and neural networks. I refer to such representations as models. Although models can be re-used in toto in another setting, there may be loss of performance or, even more problematically, fundamental mismatches between the data required by the model and the data available in the new setting making their re-use impossible. The field of transfer learning develops algorithms for transferring knowledge from one setting to another. Transfer learning, a sub-area of machine learning, explicitly distinguishes between a source setting, which has the model that we would like to re-use, and a target setting, which has data insufficient for deriving a model from data and therefore needs to re-use a model from a source setting. I propose to develop and evaluate several Bayesian Network Transfer Learning (BN- TL) algorithms and a Convolutional Neural Network Transfer Learning algorithm. My specific research aims are to: (1) further develop and evaluate BN-TL for sharing computable knowledge across healthcare settings; (2) develop and evaluate BN-TL for updating computable knowledge over time; and (3) develop and evaluate a deep transfer learning algorithm that combines knowledge in heterogeneous scenarios. I will do this research on models that are used to automatically detect cases of infectious disease such as influenza. Impact: The proposed research takes advantage of large datasets that I previously developed; therefore I expect to quickly have results with immediate implications for how case detection models are shared from a region that is initially experiencing an epidemic to another location that wishes to have optimal case-detection capability as early as possible. More generally, it will bring insight into machine learning enhanced biomedical knowledge sharing and updating. This training grant will prepare me to work independently and lead efforts to develop computational solutions to meet biomedical needs in future R01 projects. Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Narrative Re-using computable biomedical knowledge in the form of a mathematical model in a new setting is challenging because the new setting may not have data needed as inputs to the model. This project will develop and evaluate transfer learning algorithms, which are computer programs that adapt a model to a new setting by removing and adding local variables to it. The developed methods for re-using models are expected to benefit the public’s health by: (1) improving case detection during epidemics by enabling re-use of automatic case detectors developed in the earliest affected regions with other regions, and, more generally, (2) increasing the impact of NIH’s investment in machine learning by enabling machine-learned models to be used in more institutions and locations.",Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge,9952803,K99LM013383,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Influenza', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parainfluenza', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'computer program', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'detector', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'skills', 'statistics', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2020,92359,0.007935770645367659
"Real-time Non-Rigid 3D Reconstruction and Registration for Laparoscopic-guided Minimally Invasive Liver Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Liver deformation leads to difficulties in tumor localization during minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS). The goal of this proposal is to develop an efficient surgical navigation tool for MILS by compensating for liver deformation and mapping preoperative data to the patient’s anatomy. Specifically, we will develop a non-rigid simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) approach to estimate the deformation of liver surface from stereo laparoscopy videos. We will develop machine-learning methods to detect landmarks and perform non- rigid registration. The algorithms will be implemented on a GPU to achieve real-time. Preliminary data has demonstrated the feasibility. During the R00 phase, we will mainly address the clinical needs and develop novel ways to provide intraoperative guidance. This project will greatly improve the tumor resection accuracy in MILS. The candidate for this award Dr. Haoyin Zhou is a postdoc at Surgical Planning Laboratory (SPL), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS).

"Lupus Nephritis Neural Network, LuNN Up to 60% of adults and 80% of children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) develop nephritis (LN), with 10–30% progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The gold standard for diagnosis of LN is a renal biopsy. Histological parameters remain the best predictors of ESRD. Despite being the gold standard, histological diagnosis of LN has several shortcomings. In multiple inter-observer renal pathology assessment studies reported thus far, the inter- pathologist correlation coefficients, or concordance, in assessing most histological parameters have been sub-optimal. This has provided the impetus for the current proposal. We propose to leverage the power of computer vision and deep learning to build a classifier that rivals the best-trained renal pathologists in making a histological diagnosis of LN using current diagnostic criteria. We propose to train a deep convolutional neural network to distinguish the different LN classes, and to identify a full spectrum of histological attributes useful for diagnosis. We will compare the performance of the newly generated neural network in scoring glomerular/tubulo-interstitial features and LN classes, against a panel of human renal pathologists. Finally, we propose to build a neural network that can predict clinical outcome based on baseline renal pathology. Reliable and reproducible classification of LN could dramatically improve patient management and long-term renal and patient survival. Despite being the gold standard, histological diagnosis of lupus nephritis is imprecise, and marked by significant inter-pathologist discordance in readings.

"Conceptualizing Actionability in Clinical Genomic Screening Project Summary/Abstract. Clinical genomic sequencing (CGS) produces large amounts of data, much of which is hard to characterize or may have a negligible influence on health. The concept of actionability is commonly used to help separate information that may be useful from information that is likely irrelevant for patients. Actionability directs attention to whether genomic information warrants action and reflects its initial development as a strategy to augment diagnosis and treatment in sick patients. As CGS expands towards healthy populations in primary care settings, actionability is still widely embraced despite little consensus regarding its definition and use. Because this ambiguity could become an obstacle to the successful implementation of clinical genomic sequencing in healthy populations, greater clarity about this concept is necessary. The proposed research will fulfill this need by characterizing the emergence and varied meanings of actionability in clinical genomics, focusing on clinical genomics' transition into primary care settings. By identifying underlying values and assumptions related to actionability, this research will push beyond definitional disputes and provide a deeper framework for assessing how genetic information is valued. The specific aims are: 1. Identify and characterize, through in-depth interviews, how genomics experts and primary care providers conceptualize what makes genomic information actionable for healthy populations. 2. Identify and characterize, through a natural language processing (NLP) analysis of published literature, how the concept of actionability emerged, spread, and is used throughout clinical genomics. 3. Convene a workshop with genomics experts, primary care providers, and ELSI scholars to produce a white paper on actionability and the ethical, effective integration of CGS into primary care, guided by the results from Aims 1 and 2. This K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award includes a highly-structured, mentored training program that will support the candidate's goal to become an independent, mixed-methods ELSI investigator focused on assessing the value of genomic information. To achieve this career goal, the candidate will: 1. Receive training in genetic and genomic science to facilitate collaboration with genomics care teams and make scientifically accurate policy recommendations 2. Build new methodological skills in biomedical informatics and natural language processing to conduct generalizable research 3. Publish and engage with scientific and medical audiences to have a more direct impact on future guidelines and policies. 4. Develop a collaborative and interdisciplinary research network. This training will include coursework, guided readings, network building, and sustained mentorship by a highly-qualified team of faculty with expertise in ELSI research, bioethics, clinical genomics, biomedical informatics, and the history and sociology of medicine. This training will prepare the candidate to transition to an independent ELSI investigator focused on ethical issues related to the actionability of genomic health information – an ELSI research priority in Genetic and Genomic Healthcare.

"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,9891936,K01AG061274,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data Set', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Rate', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Internal Medicine', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Price', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Savings', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'asthmatic patient', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'health economics', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,K01,2020,130228,-0.009267438155955633
"A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication PROJECT SUMMARY We will develop novel computer vision tools to reliably and precisely measure nonverbal social communication through quantifying communicative facial and bodily expressions. Our tools will be designed and developed in order to maximize their usability by non-engineer behavioral scientists, filling the enormous gap between engineering advances and their clinical accessibility. Significance: Social interaction inherently relies on perception and production of coordinated face and body expressions. Indeed, atypical face and body movements are observed in many disorders, impacting social interaction and communication. Traditional systems for quantifying nonverbal communication (e.g., FACS, BAP) require extensive training and coding time. Their tedious coding requirements drastically limits their scalability and reproducibility. While an extensive literature exists on advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques for face and body analysis, there is no well-established method commonly used in mental health community to quantify production of facial and bodily expressions or efficiently capture individual differences in nonverbal communication in general. As a part of this proposal, we will develop a computer vision toolbox including tools that are both highly granular and highly scalable, to allow for measurement of complex social behavior in large and heterogeneous populations. Approach: Our team will develop tools that provide granular metrics of nonverbal social behavior, including localized face and body kinematics, characteristics of elicited expressions, and imitation performance. Our tools will facilitate measurement of social communication both within a person and between people, to allow for assessment of individual social communication cues as well as those that occur within bidirectional social contexts. Preliminary Data: We have developed and applied novel computer vision tools to assess: (1) diversity of mouth motion during conversational speech (effect size d=1.0 in differentiating young adults with and without autism during a brief natural conversation), (2) interpersonal facial coordination (91% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis in young adults during a brief natural conversation, replicated in an independent child sample), and (3) body action imitation (85% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis based on body imitation performance). As apart of current proposal, we will develop more generic methods that can be used in normative and clinical samples. Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop tools to automatically quantify fine-grained face movements and their coordination during facial expression production; in Aim 2, we will develop tools to quantify body joint kinematics and their coordination during bodily expression production; in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the tools’ ability to yield dimensional metrics using machine learning. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of nonverbal social communication, providing a scalable solution to measure individual variability, within a dimensional and transdiagnostic framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project develops novel tools for measuring nonverbal social communication as manifested through facial and bodily expressions. Using advanced computer vision and machine learning methodologies, we will quantify humans’ communicative social behavior. The results of this project will impact public health by facilitating a rich characterization of normative development of social functioning, providing access to precise phenotypic information for neuroscience and genetics studies, and by measuring subtle individual differences to determine whether some interventions or treatments work better than others.",A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication,9946780,R01MH122599,"['Adolescent', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Educational Materials', 'Engineering', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral health', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'open source', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'tool', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2020,150000,-0.018658502923864367
"WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNDIAGNOSED DISEASES NETWORK CLINICAL SITE 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNDIAGNOSED DISEASES NETWORK CLINICAL SITE,10124937,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data dissemination', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,150000,0.0003399656103933519
"Bioethics of syndrome diagnosis using 3D image analysis Project Summary/Abstract This supplement will address the unintended consequences and collateral damage that arise when facial recognition software is used for medical purposes, such as for syndrome diagnosis as in our Facebase-funded project. In Aim 1, we will determine whether the accuracy of this technology varies based on self-reported race, sex and age. In this aim, we examine our existing database for evidence of bias based on self-reported race, sex or age. We further determine the extent to which these variables influence classification performance. To the extent sample sizes allow, we will carry this analysis to the level of specific syndromes. Finally, we will use anonymized reference datasets of non-syndromic faces to compare false positive rates based on NIH race definitions, sex and age. The outcome of this aim is to objectively establish bias and estimate the effects of under-representation across race, age and sex categories within our data. In Aim 2, we will determine how the reports of race-, sex- and age-based bias in facial recognition technology may influence views of the technology and its application amongst researchers and clinicians. This aim will establish the extent to which the storing of large databases of facial images and the application of machine learning processes to them for diagnostic purposes may raise privacy concerns. The concerns investigated will include potential hacks into protected health information; fear relating to the bias in some facial recognition software (and, potentially, in the Facebase database); and fear of discrimination in the application of the technology, such as by insurers. The outcome will be a white paper that targets a high-profile journal, summarizing the findings and defining crucial issues that should guide the development of facial imaging for disease diagnosis and clinical usage. Project Narrative Our supplement application will address the important question of unintended consequences and collateral damage when facial recognition software is used for medical purposes, such as for syndrome diagnosis as in our Facebase-funded project. The use of large facial recognition databases in medicine represents a frontier that arrives with tremendous potential but undeniable risks. Our central aims are: (1) determine whether the accuracy of this technology varies based on self-reported race, sex and age; and (2) determine how the reports of race-, sex- and age-based bias in facial recognition technology may influence views of the technology and its application amongst researchers and clinicians.",Bioethics of syndrome diagnosis using 3D image analysis,10132648,U01DE028729,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Age', 'Authoritarianism', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioethics', 'Biometry', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computational Biology', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Journals', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient imaging', 'Performance', 'Privacy', 'Private Sector', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Sector', 'Race', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'craniofacial', 'disease diagnosis', 'facial recognition software', 'frontier', 'human data', 'intervention cost', 'new technology', 'professor', 'repository', 'sex', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2020,152200,-0.008721516274961226
"Automated Detection and Classification of Laryngeal Diseases Using Deep Neural Networks PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this project is to improve the care of patients with laryngeal disorders through development of automated diagnostic support for in-office flexible laryngoscopy. To accomplish this goal, we propose developing neural network-based algorithms to detect and classify structural laryngeal lesions in laryngoscopy images. An automated diagnostic tool for in-office laryngoscopy such as we propose will have several benefits: (1) It will improve access to care for patients with symptoms of laryngeal dysfunction living in communities with limited otolaryngology resources, (2) It will improve early detection of laryngeal cancers potentially reducing the morbidity of treatment, and (3) It will prove a valuable teaching tool for students and residents first learning to interpret laryngoscopic exams. Flexible laryngoscopy is a common in-office procedure performed by otolaryngologists to evaluate the upper aerodigestive tract in patients with symptoms of laryngeal dysfunction. Subtle differences in the appearance of laryngeal lesions enable otolaryngologists to differentiate benign lesions from suspected malignant ones. The expertise and clinical acumen to correctly interpret laryngoscopic findings requires years of training and therefore laryngoscopy is largely only performed in subspecialty otolaryngology clinics. The primary objective of this project is to develop neural network-based algorithms to detect and classify structural laryngeal lesions. Our hypothesis is that these algorithms can be trained using a large dataset of laryngeal images to accurately detect and classify structural laryngeal lesions on flexible laryngoscopic exam. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: (1) Generate a dataset of high-quality, labeled endoscopic laryngeal images corresponding to normal and structural lesions of the larynx, (2) Develop a location-aware anchor-based reasoning neural network for accurate detection of laryngeal lesions, and (3) Develop an adaptive network model for classification of structural laryngeal pathologies including papilloma, polyp, leukoplakia and suspected malignancy. With expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of laryngeal disorders and computer vision, including object detection and classification, our multidisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to complete this project. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to revolutionize in-office laryngoscopy through development of a deep neural network-based automated detection and classification system for diagnosis of structural diseases of the larynx. Currently, flexible laryngoscopy is only performed by expert subspecialists with years of experience because developing the expertise and clinical acumen to correctly interpret laryngoscopic findings requires years of training. Through development of deep neural network-based algorithms to detect and classify laryngeal lesions on in- office laryngoscopy, we will improve access to care for patients living in communities without subspecialty otolaryngology care and will develop an important teaching tool for clinicians learning to interpret laryngoscopic exams.",Automated Detection and Classification of Laryngeal Diseases Using Deep Neural Networks,10043172,R03CA253212,"['Aerodigestive Tract', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Benign', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hoarseness', 'Image', 'Improve Access', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Laryngeal Diseases', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Laryngoscopy', 'Larynx', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Leukoplakia', 'Location', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of larynx', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Network-based', 'Normal Range', 'Otolaryngologist', 'Otolaryngology', 'Papilloma', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plug-in', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vision research', 'Work', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'detector', 'digital', 'experience', 'feature extraction', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neural network', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2020,154375,-0.045585934862788925
"West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification Project Summary – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) is committed to the overall goals of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Initiative and specifically aims to largely improve small molecule identifications. Understanding metabolism is important to gain insight into biochemical processes and relevant to battle diseases such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. Compound identification in metabolomics is still a daunting task with many unknown compounds and false positive identifications. The major goal of the WCMC is therefore to develop processes and resources that accelerate and improve the accuracy of the compound identification workflow for experts and medical professionals. The WCMC for Compound Identification is structured in three different entities: the Administrative Core, the Computational Core and the Experimental Core. The Center is led by the Director Prof. Fiehn in close collaboration with quantum chemistry experts Prof. Wang and Prof. Tantillo, and metabolomics experts Dr. Barupal and Dr. Kind with broad support from mass spectrometry, computational metabolomics and programming experts. The Administrative Core will assist the Computational and Experimental Core to develop and validate large in-silico mass spectral libraries, retention time prediction models and innovative methods for constraining and ranking lists of isomers in an integrated process of cheminformatics tools and databases. The developed tools and databases will be made available to all Common Fund Metabolomics Consortium (CF-MC) members and professional working groups. The WCMC will also provide guidance for compound identification to the National Metabolomics Data Repository. The broad dissemination of developed compound identification protocols, training for compound identification workflows, databases and distribution of internal reference standard kits for metabolomic standardization will overall widely support the metabolomics community. Project Narrative – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) Understanding metabolism is relevant to find both markers and mechanisms of diseases and health phenotypes, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer.

"Big Flow Cytometry Data: Data Standards, Integration and Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Flow cytometry is a single-cell measurement technology that is data-rich and plays a critical role in basic research and clinical diagnostics. The volume and dimensionality of data sets currently produced with modern instrumentation is orders of magnitude greater than in the past. Automated analysis methods in the field have made great progress in the past five years. The tools are available to perform automated cell population identification, but the infrastructure, methods and data standards do not yet exist to integrate and compare non-standardized big flow cytometry data sets available in public repositories. This proposal will develop the data standards, software infrastructure and computational methods to enable researchers to leverage the large amount of public cytometry data in order to integrate, re-analyze, and draw novel biological insights from these data sets. The impact of this project will be to provide researchers with tools that can be used to bridge the gap between inference from isolated single experiments or studies, to insights drawn from large data sets from cross-study analysis and multi-center trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE The aims of this project are to develop standards, software and methods for integrating and analyzing big and diverse flow cytometry data sets. The project will enable users of cytometry to directly compare diverse and non-standardized cytometry data to each other and make biological inferences about them.

"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs.

"Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease ABSTRACT The purpose of this award is to provide Dr. Elsie Ross, Assistant Professor of Surgery (Vascular Surgery) and Medicine (Biomedical Informatics Research) at Stanford University, the support necessary to transition her from a junior investigator into an independent surgeon-scientist in translational biomedical informatics. Dr. Ross is a vascular surgeon with an advanced degree in health services research and postdoctoral training in biomedical informatics. Her long-term goal is to combine her interdisciplinary training to develop and implement machine learning tools that will enable the delivery of precise, high-value care to patients with cardiovascular diseases. Her career development activities focus on advancing her ability to translate informatics discoveries into viable clinical tools by 1) completing didactic courses to deepen and expand her knowledge of deep learning algorithms, clinical trials and implementation science, 2) designing and conducting her first independent human subjects clinical research study evaluating the performance of machine learning technology, 3) implementing and evaluating the effects of an electronic health record (EHR)-based screening tool to identify latent vascular disease, and 4) strengthening her previous training in cost-effectiveness analysis to enable her future aim of evaluating the associated costs and utility of pro-active, automated disease screening. The candidate has convened a mentorship team that includes Dr. Nigam Shah, a biomedical informatics expert who combines machine learning, text-mining and medical ontologies to enable a learning health care system; Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey a world-expert in cardiovascular clinical trials; and Dr. Paul Heidenreich, an expert in implementation sciences with a focus on the use of EHR interventions to improve care quality for cardiovascular patients and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new technologies. The research proposal builds on the candidate's prior work with using machine learning and EHR data to evaluate and predict cardiovascular disease outcomes. The candidate now proposes to characterize the performance of machine learning algorithms in identifying patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) using EHR data (Aim 1), evaluate whether learned classification models perform better than traditional risk factors for identification of undiagnosed PAD in a prospective patient cohort (Aim 2), and implement an EHR-based screening tool to identify patients with undiagnosed PAD and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment effects (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research will result in a novel, EHR-based screening tool for identification of undiagnosed vascular disease that can decrease PAD-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through earlier and more aggressive medical management. This research will also form the basis for an R01 application before the end of the award to conduct a multi-site randomized-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of EHR- based proactive PAD screening. ! ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripheral artery disease is a prevalent yet under-diagnosed condition that can lead to limb loss, stroke, heart attacks and/or premature death. Work proposed in this grant aims to develop technology using electronic health records and machine learning algorithms to automatically identify patients with undiagnosed peripheral artery disease and recommend treatment.

"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team. Through this career development plan, Dr. Shah will build upon her prior training in clinical cardiology and research methodology and lay a strong foundation for a high impact research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Atrial fibrillation affects six million US adults, and the prevalence is expected to double by 2030. As new drug and device treatments for stroke prevention emerge, patients and providers increasingly need accurate methods to monitor and improve patient safety.",Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification,9899862,K08HL136850,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulants', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Competence', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vital Status', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'advanced analytics', 'aging population', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'mortality', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'stroke risk', 'stroke therapy', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2020,163080,-0.011718653591562602
"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infants born prematurely experience some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity and are among the most expensive patients in all of pediatrics. Now, with the availability of large sources of healthcare data from insurance claims databases and electronic health records, there is an opportunity to better understand prematurity and its predictors using computational techniques. We propose leveraging state of the art deep learning models built using data from hospitals and insurers to both predict which pregnancies will result in preterm birth and to predict which preterm infants will experience severe cardiac and pulmonary morbidity.",Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning,9850130,K01HL141771,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Accounting', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Boston', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cardiac', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Graduate Degree', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Human Pathology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatology', 'Outcome', 'Patent Ductus Arteriosus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Premature Labor', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'education planning', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'peer', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'social', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'structured data']",NHLBI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2020,166320,0.001559919801361212
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,9853783,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2020,167900,0.002003007232997597
"The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate for this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award aims to become an international leader in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel health care interventions and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis that is diagnosed in utero but that persists after birth, or postnatally persistent hydronephrosis (PNH). The proposed mentored research and career development plan lays the foundation for this career and the eventual development of a standardized management strategy for PNH by generating the evidence needed to support its development and creating an ultrasound (U/S) grading tool needed to implement it in routine clinical practice. Kidney U/Ss are the main test to monitor PNH, but U/S reports are heterogeneously formatted and contain synonymous and ambiguous terms that complicate their interpretation. Another major obstacle in the field is a need to predict those at risk for worsening disease and to better understand the natural history of PNH. Aim 1 will develop a Natural Language Processing algorithm to automatically translate free-text U/S reports into structured data providing the PNH grade. Aim 2 will use baseline U/S and renal scan data to predict the PNH grade at 2 years. Aim 3 will use growth curves to simulate PNH’s natural history and provide the time and frequency of disease resolution/improvement, stability, and progression. The candidate brings to this proposal experience as a pediatric urological surgeon at a large tertiary care children’s hospital and core research skills in epidemiology and biostatistics. An integral part of his career development will be a continued relationship with an outstanding multidisciplinary mentoring team with complementary strengths. The candidate’s primary mentor is Rachel Hess, MD, MS. Dr. Hess is a world renown expert in implementing interventions in routine clinical care and has an exemplary track record of mentorship. Flory Nkoy, MD, MS, MPH, the candidate’s co-mentor, is an expert in bioinformatics and internationally recognized for developing, disseminating, and implementing pioneering approaches to treat chronic disease in children. Advisors include Jeffrey Ferraro, PhD, and Wendy Chapman, PhD (bioinformatics), Angela Presson, PhD (biostatistics), Patrick Cartwright, MD (pediatric urology), and Mark Ebert, MD (pediatric radiology). The proposed research and training plan will establish the candidate’s solid foundation in bioinformatics, augment his prior epidemiology and biostatistics training, and provide extraordinary training in dissemination and implementation science. This will provide him with the skills and experience necessary for a career as a successful independent researcher focused on developing, implementing, and disseminating novel management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Hydronephrosis diagnosed in utero but persisting after birth (PNH) affects tens of thousands of infants each year in the United States, but its management is complicated by ambiguous reporting of hydronephrosis severity and a relatively limited understanding of predictors of disease outcome and knowledge of the disease’s natural history. The proposed research uses the largest known pediatric hydronephrosis cohort to develop a tool to translates free-text ultrasound reports into coded PNH grades, predict the 2-year outcome using 3-month baseline data, and apply sophisticated modeling techniques to simulate the disease’s natural history. Taken together, results from this proposal will lead to the development of a standardized management strategy for PNH and facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent research career in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel treatment and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, beginning with pediatric hydronephrosis.",The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH),9892829,K08DK119535,"['2 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Image', 'Infant', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obstruction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Radiology', 'Performance', 'Predictive Factor', 'Pregnancy', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Renal pelvis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Selection Bias', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologic Surgeon', 'Urology', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'in utero diagnosis', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatrician', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prognostic', 'research and development', 'skills', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urinary', 'urologic']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2020,168411,-0.016709911092420218

"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,9882206,K23AR075070,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calcium Pyrophosphate', 'Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diuretics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Female', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vascular calcification', 'Vascularization', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bisphosphonate', 'calcium indicator', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'crystallinity', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'sex', 'side effect', 'stem', 'structured data', 'targeted treatment', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2020,176541,0.003065839548463128
"Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The emergence of electronic medical records, large data registries and readily accessible, protected servers have resulted in an explosion of digital information with potentially high clinical impact for improving patient management and outcomes. Big data warehouses that capture standardized information within the scope of clinical practices allow trained scientists to not only engage in traditional hypothesis testing, but to also uncover new hypotheses, refine existing theories and apply new discoveries to health assessments and interventions. Despite the accessibility and potential impact of these data platforms, clinician scientists have traditionally directed experiments that incorporate relatively small sample sizes and data from individual laboratories, and have not been trained in big data analytics or in engaging appropriate team scientists who work in this space, such as computer scientists, biostatisticians and engineers. The overarching goal of this proposal is to mentor early patient oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analytics and to mentor and involve early data science scholars in communication and swallowing research. The PI proposes four primary mentorship and research goals in this K24 renewal proposal: 1. Train a cadre of early stage communication and swallowing scientists in data science methods, including machine learning, by an expert, interdisciplinary, collaborative data science team, 2. Engage and introduce early career data scientists from fields of biostatistics, computer science and engineering to communication and swallowing sciences, and respective data sets, toward facilitating interdisciplinary data science teams and research productivity, 3. Apply novel data science methods to identify phenotypes of swallowing impairment and severity classifications in patient groups known to be at high risk for nutritional and health complications related to dysphagia, and 4. Develop a new area of research in machine learning applications toward improving reliability of physiologic swallowing assessment. The data science theme of the career development and research plan directly align with NIDCD's Strategic Plan for Data Science which lists as its mission: Storing, managing, standardizing and publishing the vast amounts of data produced by biomedical research. NIDCD recognizes that accessible, well-organized, secure and efficiently operated data resources are critical to modern scientific inquiry…and by maximizing the value of data generated through NIH-funded efforts, the pace of biomedical discoveries and medical breakthroughs for better health outcomes can be accelerated. PROJECT NARRATIVE The emergence of electronic health records exposes clinicians to massive amounts of information about the millions of patients who suffer from communication and swallowing disorders, yet most clinical scientists do not have the training or skill to apply meaning to the data toward improving patient care. The overarching mentorship goal of this proposal is to train early, patient-oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analyses, including computer machine learning approaches. The research project will uncover distinct patterns and severity of swallowing impairments in large groups of patients with high risk medical diagnoses, which will have high impact on patient care planning and identification of treatments that directly target these impairments for improved outcomes.",Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders,9892671,K24DC012801,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Barium swallow', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'data registry', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'human error', 'impression', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'uptake']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,K24,2020,183209,0.007945882332214377
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. In carrying out the research outlined in the following proposal, we plan to develop and apply machine learning methods to better identify subpopulations of individuals who have similar forms of COPD, potentially enabling better, targeted therapies.",Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD,9948018,K25HL130637,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cachexia', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Mass', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Scheme', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'career development', 'cigarette smoke', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'flexibility', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'particle', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K25,2020,189000,-0.06120475283458491
"Developing Machine Learning-Driven Prediction Models and Therapeutic Strategies for Circulatory Shock in Critically-ill Patients K23 Abstract This application is for a K23 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award entitled “Developing Machine Learning-Driven Prediction Models and Therapeutic Strategies for Circulatory Shock in Critically-ill Patients”. I am a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of Pittsburgh.

"Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  We propose to develop an automated critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) screening algorithm using machine learning techniques to combine non-invasive measurements of perfusion and oxygenation. Oxygen saturation (SpO2)-based screening is the current standard for CCHD screening, however it fails to detect up to 50% of asymptomatic newborns with CCHD or nearly 900 newborns in the United States annually. The majority of newborns missed by SpO2 screening have defects with aortic obstruction, such as coarctation of the aorta (CoA), that do not result in deoxygenated blood entering circulation. Non-invasive measurements of perfusion such as perfusion index (PIx) and pulse oximetry waveform analysis is expected to improve the detection of newborns with defects such as CoA, which is currently the most commonly missed CCHD by SpO2 screening. Both PIx and pulse oximetry waveforms can be measured non-invasively and with the same equipment used for SpO2 screening.  Members of our team recently showed that the addition of PIx, a non-invasive measurement of pulsatile blood flow, has the potential to improve CCHD detection otherwise missed by SpO2 screening. However, variability of PIx over brief time periods (seconds) and human error in its interpretation limit its clinical capabilities. Additionally, human error in interpretation of the current SpO2 screening algorithm leads to missed diagnoses and inappropriate testing in healthy newborns. Therefore, an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm is needed to both simplify the screening process, and improve detection of defects that are missed with SpO2 screening. In order to achieve that, we will identify the optimal PIx waveforms to create a metric that discriminates between newborns with and without CCHD. We will perform pulse oximetry waveform analysis to identify other non-invasive components with discriminatory capacity for newborns with CCHD. Additionally, we will apply supervised machine learning techniques to automate the algorithm interpretation.  The proposed research is significant because an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm could save the lives of hundreds of newborns with CCHD that are not diagnosed by SpO2 screening. Additionally, this is innovative as it will be the first automatic interpretation of PIx measurement among newborns with CCHD and merging of automated PIx and SpO2, which will allow for easy implementation at later steps. Through collaboration with four pediatric cardiac centers, we will establish the infrastructure and necessary multidisciplinary relationships to conduct future multicenter studies to evaluate this novel combined SpO2-PIx algorithm on a large scale involving thousands of newborns. Improving the detection of CCHD will require a multidisciplinary approach among all the individuals involved in the care and screening of newborns with CCHD. Additionally, collaboration with engineering and computer sciences will be necessary to automate the SpO2-PIx CCHD screening algorithm. PROJECT NARRATIVE A screening approach that improves earlier detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction is critically necessary. This application seeks to develop a screening algorithm that will combine the current screening standard, oxygen saturation, with non-invasive measurements of perfusion. This high risk, high reward approach is fundamentally different from other approaches as it will use machine learning techniques, and is expected to improve the detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction and automate the interpretation of the screening results.","Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets",10018507,R21HD099239,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Aortic coarctation', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Critical Congenital Heart Defects', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal Screening', 'New York', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obstruction', 'Oxygen', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulsatile Flow', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research', 'Savings', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'aortic arch', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'congenital heart disorder', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'human error', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infant death', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'screening', 'supervised learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2020,192195,-0.03937725758165887
"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development award will: a) Lead to the development and validation of a pediatric-specific Environmental Enteropathy (EE) Deep Learning Net for small intestinal structure which is urgently needed to standardize the diagnosis, care, and research of EE worldwide; b) Employ computational methods to correlate Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing morphological EE features with multiomic data to provide comprehensive diagnostic and predictive criteria for EE, and c) Validation of promising circulating biomarkers against intestinal biopsies, the diagnostic gold standard for enteropathies.

"Automated Data Collection on Antimicrobial Use in Dogs and Cats in a Tertiary Hospital and Private Practices Judicious antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine is important because improper antimicrobial use can contribute to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens, which makes subsequent use of these drugs less effective in both human and veterinary medicine. There is very little on-the-ground information about veterinary clinicians’ antimicrobial use (AMU) practices in companion animal practice in the US. veterinary medicine. To improve our understanding of antimicrobial use in dogs and cats, we propose to create a nationwide digital surveillance system to collect critical AMU data using existing electronic practice information management systems (PIMS) in collaboration with veterinary industry partners. The system will automatically harvest AMU and patient data from digital PIMS. The proposed system will harvest data collected in routine veterinary examinations from existing PIMS systems and therefore will not require any additional effort from practitioners to participate in the program. Natural language processing, a machine learning method used to classify unstructured text, will be used to review electronic medical records to determine patients’ diagnosis. We aim to prototype the system in our native digital PIMS at North Carolina State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine Teaching hospital. We will then enroll additional private veterinary practices, including general practice, specialty hospitals, and emergency clinics, as sentinels and collect the same detailed PIMS data from a more representative set of clinics. Working closely with the sentinel clinics will provide a deep understanding of how our system operates in private clinics, and in the final stage we aim to expand the fully automated system to PIMS nationwide. The combination of sentinel clinics with the nationwide survey of clinics will create a powerful broad and deep surveillance system for antimicrobial use in veterinary clinics. A broad suite of AMU parameters will be estimated from this data, and the results reported to the FDA in an annual report. Additionally, we will share the data with other researchers through an web-based portal and GitHub repositories. This system will provide the critical data and analysis to understand veterinary AMU in the US. NARRATIVE Veterinarians play a central role in protecting animal and human health by preserving the efficacy of the antibiotics that their use for their patients. We have created a partnership among a public university, private veterinary hospitals, and a leading industry partner to collect information on how antibiotics are being used in cat and dog practices across the country with no disruption to the participating hospitals. The data will support FDA’s commitment to promoting antimicrobial stewardship.",Automated Data Collection on Antimicrobial Use in Dogs and Cats in a Tertiary Hospital and Private Practices,10166402,U01FD007057,[' '],FDA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,U01,2020,199999,0.017361821898006762
"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream infections caused by Staph- ylococcus aureus in the Veterans Health Administration.",Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections,9951022,K08DA048163,"['Acute suppurative arthritis due to bacteria', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embolism', 'Endocarditis', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV risk', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C Transmission', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Predisposition', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'blood treatment', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health administration', 'heroin use', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'injection drug use', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid injection', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid user', 'overdose death', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'prescription opioid', 'responsible research conduct', 'screening', 'skin microbiota', 'time interval', 'treatment services', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2020,203040,-0.008432672751153482
"Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with over 30,000 new HPV-related-cancers are diagnosed annually. Although HPV vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2006 and recommended for routine vaccination for school-age girls and boys, vaccination rates remain low. One reason that has contributed to low vaccination rates is incorrect “risk perceptions” around HPV vaccines such as the high perceived risks of adverse events or side effects from the HPV vaccine. Incorrect risk perceptions are often rooted in the false information about HPV vaccines that people are exposed to in their daily life, including social media. The impact of social media on health information is substantial. Negative social-media HPV-vaccine information has been found to have an association with low vaccination coverage. Given the negative consequences of false information, there is a need to develop a robust and scalable way to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it propagates and negatively impacts behavior. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to build a model to identify false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter, demonstrate its impact on individual risk perceptions and measure its underlying mechanisms on risk perception formation. We propose a novel approach to leverage machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, crowdsourcing/expert data annotation, psycholinguistic analysis and statistical modeling to investigate the false HPV-vaccine information collectively (in terms of its detection and propagation patterns) and individually (in terms of its impact and underlying cognitive mechanisms). Our study will first build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter. By modeling the domain-specific HPV- vaccine related text content, information-veracity related linguistic features, individual and collective user behaviors, and dissemination patterns, our model will be able to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it gets verified and spreads widely. We will then investigate the impact of false HPV-vaccine information on risk perceptions around HPV vaccination operationalized by natural language processing methods and a developed HPV-vaccine Risk Lexicon. We will further conduct psycholinguistic analysis on the false HPV-vaccine information and use statistical modeling to uncover the underlying mechanism of risk perceptions. Our study will make a critical and timely contribution to identifying the false HPV-vaccine information and its impact, which has the potential to be applied to other health topics. This proposed project will also address the National Cancer Institute priorities in promoting HPV vaccines and combating misinformation in cancer prevention and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE The uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in part because of incorrect perceptions of vaccination risks, which has been linked to the spread of false HPV-vaccine information. The proposed study seeks to build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on social media (Twitter) and determine its impact on risk perceptions of the HPV vaccine. The findings will provide important contributions to understand the impact of false health information on HPV vaccination behavior and could be expanded to other health topics.",Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions,9954963,R21CA237483,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Individual', 'Information Dissemination', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Politics', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'School-Age Population', 'Semantics', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Text', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'boys', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer prevention', 'combat', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'girls', 'high risk', 'information model', 'information processing', 'multilevel analysis', 'news', 'novel strategies', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'risk perception', 'side effect', 'social media', 'theories', 'uptake']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,211659,-0.007067311868908116
"An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning Abstract: The next generation of science and health care professionals will need to understand the foundational concepts of physics. While textbooks play a critical role in science learning, these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. Unfortunately, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current physical science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with interactive texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned force and motion (NGSS PS2A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing and developing science learning games (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content in both English and Spanish to address 9 additional NGSS standards (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive learning technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning disabilities. This Fast-Track project will produce a bilingual, digital platform to support students’ understanding of Physical Science, which will allow students to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages, play science learning games, and receive personalized content. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students, develop teacher support materials, and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning",10006915,R44GM137622,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Books', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'physical science', 'reading ability', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2020,231500,0.017633857841052408
"SCH: INT: Computational Tools for Avoidaint/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder  Intellectual Merit: This project will for the first time provide the fundamental tools to integrate unique multimodal data toward screening, diagnosis, and intervention in eating disorders, with an initial focus on children with ARFID and related developmental and health disorders. This work is critical for enriching the understanding of healthy development and for broadening the foundations of behavioral data science. ARFID ·motivates the development of new computer vision and data analysis tools critical for the analysis of multidimensional behavioral data. The main aims are: 1. Develop and user individualized and integrated continuous facial affect coding from videos to discern affective motivations for food avoidance, critical due to the unique sensory aspects of eating disorders, and resulting from active stimulation via friendly and carefully designed images/videos and real food presentation; 2. Use data analysis and machine learning to derive sensory profiles based on patterns of food consumption and preference from existing unique datasets of selective eaters; and 3. Translate the tools developed in Aims 1 and 2 into the clinic and home to assess the capacity of these tools to define a threshold of clinically significant food avoidance, to detect change in acceptability of food with repeated presentations, and to examine and modify the accuracy of our food suggestion algorithms. Broader Impacts: The impact of this application comprises two broad domains. First is the derivation of processes, tools, and strategies to analyze very disparate data across multiple levels of analysis and to codify those strategies to inform similar future work, in particular incorporating automatic behavioral coding. Second is the exploitation of these tools to address questions about the emergence of healthy/unhealthy food selectivity across the lifespan, including recommendation delivery via apps and at-home recordings. The health impact of even partial success in this project is very broad and significant. Undergraduate students will be involved in this project via the 6-weeks summer research program at the Information Initiative at Duke, a center dedicated to the fundamentals of data science and its applications; via the co-Pl's research lab devoted to eating disorders; and via the Pl's project dedicated to training undergraduate students to address eating disorders of their friends via an anonymous app. Outreach and dissemination will follow the broad use of the developed app, both in the clinic and the general population, including the Pl's connections with low-income and under-represented bi-lingual preK. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Eating disorders are potentially life-threatening mental illnesses affecting the general population; -90% of individuals never receive treatment, in part due to lack of awareness and access. Individuals with eating disorders experience a diminished quality of life, high mental and physical illness comorbidities, and an existence marked by profound loneliness and isolation. Combining expertise in eating disorders with computer vision and machine learning, we bring for the first time data science to this health challenge.

"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,10118580,R00NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncology', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2020,248966,0.002259862034992947
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder.

"Sleep metrics from machine learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnostics PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is responsive to NIH solicitation PA-17-089 for projects involving secondary analysis of pre-existing geriatric datasets. While presently there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, existing literature indicates that early diagnosis in the preclinical stage, i.e., before the onset of clinical symptoms, will be key to treatments. There is a pressing need for noninvasive predictors of cognitive decline that can enable early identification of individuals at Alzheimer’s disease risk. A mounting body of scientific evidence suggests that sleep disturbances (including microarchitectural disruptions to non-rapid-eye-motion sleep and decline in sleep quality) might be the earliest observable symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. On-the-go sleep and activity monitoring could address the need for noninvasive indicators of cognitive decline in subjects who are in the (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic) preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we will build on preliminary results that reveal a set of sleep features derived from polysomnography (PSG) that are predictive of cognitive performance. We are proposing to perform secondary analysis of sleep and cognition data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort using state-of-the-art deep learning tools to enable sleep-based prediction of cognitive impairment for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease. While PSG is the gold standard for sleep measurement, it is not well- suited for routine, day-to-day use. In comparison, wrist-based measurements (e.g. actigraphy, heart rate, ECG, and pulse oximetry) obtained from wearable devices allow “on-the-go” sleep monitoring. The combination of these on-the-go measures with the latest artificial intelligence tools is a feasible route to early Alzheimer’s diagnostics. We will use attention-guided long short-term memory autoencoders to identify overt and latent characteristics of the raw time-series datasets, which will allow us to more effectively mine the rich MESA data resource. Our deep learning framework will also take into account sociodemographic variables, indicators of health status, and medications. To ensure scientific rigor, secondary validation of the MESA-trained deep learning models will be performed on PSG and actigraphy data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, which is a longitudinal study designed to further our understanding of what differentiates normal aging from preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. To address any concern about the “black-box” nature of deep learning models, we will compare the learned feature set with sleep microarchitectural features previously computed using classical statistical techniques. Previous data suggests that a subject’s apolipoprotein ε4 (ApoE4) allele carrier status influences the degree to which their sleep patterns impact their cognitive abilities. We will verify this by incorporating ApoE4 status as an additional input to the deep learning model. Literature shows that over 60% of patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease have at least one clinical sleep disorder. The on-the-go prediction paradigm using noninvasive sleep measurements to be validated in this project will have a significant impact on early Alzheimer’s diagnostics and facilitate ongoing clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sleep disturbances are a common feature of dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease before the onset of symptoms would be critically important for disease management and therapeutics. In this R21 Exploratory Analyses Grant, we propose to develop and validate state-of-the-art deep learning tools to discover novel sleep-based predictors for Alzheimer’s disease through secondary analysis of sleep, activity, and cognitive data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort of human subjects.",Sleep metrics from machine learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnostics,10042952,R21AG068890,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Apolipoproteins', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Heart Rate', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Polysomnography', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research Design', 'Route', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'aging brain', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'carrier status', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'long short term memory', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sleep pattern', 'sleep quality', 'sociodemographic variables', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R21,2020,256922,-0.07174297706639636
"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements (DS) and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); our ability to readily identify interactions between DS with prescription medications is currently very limited. To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored. Our long-term goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate its findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support systems. The objective of this application is to develop an informatics framework to enable the discovery of DSIs by creating a DS terminology and mining scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. Towards these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Compile a comprehensive DS terminology using online resources; and (2) Discover potential DSIs from the biomedical literature. The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel informatics paradigm and resources for identifying most clinically significant DSI signals and their biological mechanisms.

"Validation of a lab-free low-cost screening test for prevention of cervical cancer: automated visual evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize medicine by improving productivity, reducing human error, and assisting with diagnosis and treatment. Image classification algorithms can be used to develop automated visual evaluation (AVE): a potential game-changer for cervical cancer prevention in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). AVE technology reads digital photographs of a cervix to provide diagnosis and treatment recommendations in seconds. AVE is a true point of care test, low cost and does not require a laboratory. AVE could be used either for stand-alone primary screening, or to triage HPV-positive women. We will compare AVE to common screening methods in LMICs: visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and conventional cytology. Enhanced Visual Assessment (EVA) System by MobileODT is a cloud-connected mobile colposcope on a smartphone platform. It is FDA cleared and used in 42 countries. MobileODT is uniquely poised to integrate AVE into the EVA System. Our aim is to validate and commercialize AVE on the EVA platform. Phase I aims will adapt AVE to run on the EVA system using an optimal neural network architecture, running either directly on the phone or as a cloud- based service. Phase II is a prospective clinical trial of 10,000 patients recruited at ministry of health sites in El Salvador. All screen-positive patients, and 10% of negative patients, will undergo colposcopy with biopsy. Sensitivity of AVE as a primary screening test will be compared to cytology and to VIA. In HPV-positive women, AVE will be compared to VIA as a triage test. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposal involves developing and testing a cervical cancer screening test: automated visual evaluation (AVE) based on an image classification algorithm that runs on smartphone-based colposcope. Included are both technical development to integrate AVE to a mobile phone application (Phase I), and a prospective validation on a screening population of 10,000 women in El Salvador (Phase II). AVE will be compared to standard tests (conventional cytology and visual inspection with acetic acid: VIA) for primary screening, and against VIA triage in an HPV+ population.",Validation of a lab-free low-cost screening test for prevention of cervical cancer: automated visual evaluation,10008280,R44CA247137,"['Acetic Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biopsy', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colposcopes', 'Colposcopy', 'Country', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'El Salvador', 'Guidelines', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Oncogenic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'ROC Curve', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recommendation', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Speed', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'World Health Organization', 'automated visual evaluation', 'base', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'data quality', 'deep learning algorithm', 'digital', 'human error', 'improved', 'innovation', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mobile application', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'overtreatment', 'phase II trial', 'primary endpoint', 'product development', 'programs', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'screening', 'screening program', 'secondary analysis', 'secondary endpoint', 'tool']",NCI,"MOBILEODT, INC.",R44,2020,297844,-0.029898367913826888
"Antibody isotyping for discrimination of disease stage and diagnosis of early Lyme disease. ABSTRACT More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease (LD). While the CDC conventional standard two-tier (CSTT) approach for serodiagnosis of LD has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement. Of a number of weaknesses associated with the supplemental immunoblot of the CSTT the most significant is low reproducibility due to the subjective visual interpretation of results. To overcome these weaknesses the CDC recently updated its recommendations based on a modified STT (MSTT) in that a second EIA can replace the immunoblot. The major goal of this project is to develop an objective, quantitative, multiplex EIA that can detect four antibody isotypes (IgM/D/G/A) and all four IgG subclasses (IgG1/2/3/4) to leverage acquisition of simultaneous antibody profile information on multiple B. burgdorferi antigens to build an assay that can discriminate Lyme disease stage with increased overall sensitivity without incurring in loss of specificity. The novelty of this study relies on: 1) evaluation of B. burgdorferi antigen-specific antibody isotypes and IgG subclasses that can be correlated with Lyme disease stage; and 2) development of new diagnostic tools using machine learning techniques to train and integrate all data and produce an objective result to discriminate early Lyme from early disseminated/late Lyme disease. We expect this Phase I SBIR to allow us to develop a new EIA for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease (isoEIAplex-Ld) and to further an ongoing collaboration with DCN diagnostics for the adaptation of our biomarkers to a new rapid Lateral Flow Assay (see Letter of Support) for a follow up Phase II SBIR .

"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,9924432,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Beds', 'Bypass', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Practices', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Head Start Program', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Preschool Child', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data mining', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'sensor', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment group', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,298890,0.0002410193597453033
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9935103,R01HD092239,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'acute care', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'post stroke', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,302394,-0.0012640970268326431
"Statistical Methods in Trans-Omics Chronic Disease Research Project Summary The broad, long-term objectives of this research are the development of novel and high-impact statistical methods for medical studies of chronic diseases, with a focus on trans-omics precision medicine research. The speciﬁc aims of this competing renewal application include: (1) derivation of efﬁcient and robust statistics for integrative association analysis of multiple omics platforms (DNA sequences, RNA expressions, methylation proﬁles, protein expressions, metabolomics proﬁles, etc.) with arbitrary patterns of missing data and with detection limits for quantitative measurements; (2) exploration of statistical learning approaches for handling multiple types of high- dimensional omics variables with structural associations and with substantial missing data; and (3) construction of a multivariate regression model of the effects of somatic mutations on gene expressions in cancer tumors for discovery of subject-speciﬁc driver mutations, leveraging gene interaction network information and accounting for inter-tumor heterogeneity in mutational effects. All these aims have been motivated by the investigators' applied research experience in trans-omics studies of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The proposed solutions are based on likelihood and other sound statistical principles. The theoretical properties of the new statistical methods will be rigorously investigated through innovative use of advanced mathematical arguments. Computationally efﬁcient and numerically stable algorithms will be developed to implement the inference procedures. The new methods will be evaluated extensively with simulation studies that mimic real data and applied to several ongoing trans-omics precision medicine projects, most of which are carried out at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Their scientiﬁc merit and computational feasibility are demonstrated by preliminary simulation results and real examples. Efﬁcient, reliable, and user-friendly open-source software with detailed documentation will be produced and disseminated to the broad scientiﬁc community. The proposed work will advance the ﬁeld of statistical genomics and facilitate trans-omics precision medicine studies of chronic diseases.

"Sample-specific Models for Molecular Portraits of Diseases in Precision Medicine A fundamental challenge in precision medicine is to understand the patterns of differentiation between individuals. To address this challenge, we propose to go beyond the traditional `one disease--one model' view of bioinformatics and pursue a new view built upon personalized patient models that facilitates precision medicine by leveraging both commonalities within a patient cohort as well as signatures unique to every individual patient. With the emergence of large-scale databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), which collect multi-omic data on many different diseases, a new “pan-omics” and “pan-disease” paradigm has emerged to jointly analyze all patients in a disease cohort while accounting for patient-specific effects. An example of this is the recently released Pan-Cancer Atlas. At the same time, next generation statistical tools to accurately and rigorously draw the necessary inferences are lacking. In this project we propose a series of mathematically rigorous, statistically sound, and computationally feasible approaches to infer sample-specific models, providing a more complete view of heterogeneous datasets. By bringing together ideas from the machine learning, statistics, and mathematical optimization communities, we provide a rigorous framework for precision medicine via sample-specific statistical models. Crucially, we propose to analyze this framework and prove strong theoretical guarantees under weak assumptions--this dramatically distinguishes our framework from much of the existing literature. Towards these goals, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: Discovery of new molecular profiles with sample-specific statistical models. We propose a general framework for inferring sample-specific models with low-rank structure based on the novel concept of distance-matching. This allows us to infer statistical models at the level of a single patient without overfitting, and is general enough to be applied for prediction, classification, and network inference as well as a variety of diseases and phenotypes. Aim 2: Multimodal approaches to personalized diagnosis--contextually interpretable models for actionable clinical decision support. In order to translate these models into practice, we propose a novel interpretable predictive model that supports complex, multimodal data types such as images and text combined with high-level interpretable features such as SNP data, gender, age, etc. This framework simultaneously boosts the accuracy of clinical predictions by exploiting sample heterogeneity while providing human-digestable explanations for the predictions being made. Aim 3: Next-generation precision medicine--algorithms and software for personalized estimation. To put our models into practical use, we will develop new algorithms for interpretable prediction of personalized clinical outcomes and visualization of personalized statistical models. All of our tools will be combined into a user-friendly software package called PrecisionX that will be freely available to researchers and clinicians everywhere. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Personalization with data is a critical challenge whenever decisions must be made at scale, and has applications that go beyond precision medicine; businesses, educational institutions, and financial institutions are among the many players that have acknowledged a stake in this complex problem. We expect the proposed work to provide a rigorous foundation for personalization with large and high-dimensional datasets, finding use throughout the broader scientific community as well as with industry and educational institutions. Alongside our collaboration with Pitt/UPMC, we will work with physicians and data scientists for practical feedback as well as provide training in the methods developed. n/a",Sample-specific Models for Molecular Portraits of Diseases in Precision Medicine,10133782,R01GM140467,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Bioinformatics', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'International', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Portraits', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Text', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'individual patient', 'large-scale database', 'molecular modeling', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'sound', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,305566,-0.01096883749362443
"Image-guided Biocuration of Disease Pathways From Scientific Literature Realization of precision medicine ideas requires an unprecedented rapid pace of translation of biomedical discoveries into clinical practice. However, while many non-canonical disease pathways and uncommon drug actions, which are of vital importance for understanding individual patient-specific disease pathways, are accumulated in the literature, most are not organized in databases. Currently, such knowledge is curated manually or semi-automatically in a very limited scope. Meanwhile, the volume of biomedical information in PubMed (currently 28 million publications) keeps growing by more than a million articles per year, which demands more efficient and effective biocuration approaches.  To address this challenge, a novel biocuration method for automatic extraction of disease pathways from figures and text of biomedical articles will be developed.  Specific Aim 1: To develop focused benchmark sets of articles to assess the performance of the biocuration pipeline.  Specific Aim 2: To develop a method for extraction of components of disease pathways from articles’ figures based on deep-learning techniques.  Specific Aim 3: To develop a method for reconstruction of disease-specific pathways through enrichment and through graph neural network (GNN) approaches.  Specific Aim 4: To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the pipeline.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop a computer-based automatic biocuration ecosystem for rapid transformation of free-text biomedical literature into a machine-processable format for medical applications.  The overall impact of the proposed project will be to significantly improve health outcomes in individualized patient cases by efficiently bringing the latest biomedical discoveries into a precision medicine setting. It will especially benefit cancer patients for which up-to-date knowledge of newly discovered molecular mechanisms and drug actions is critical.

These mechanisms will be stored in a database for further querying to assist in medical diagnosis and treatment.",Image-guided Biocuration of Disease Pathways From Scientific Literature,9987133,R01LM013392,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Selection Criteria', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'drug action', 'image guided', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge curation', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'reconstruction', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2020,313495,0.002033317295858535
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,9872178,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'data analysis pipeline', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,314000,-0.015003055904396705
"Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis Project Summary Clinical trials are foundational to evidence-based medicine, but results reporting from trials is incomplete and frequently delayed. It is estimated that as many as half of clinical trials are not published and as many as half of published trials underreport or misreport outcomes. This type of results reporting distorts the evidence available to clinicians—particularly when it comes to assessing the safety of interventions like drugs and devices—and may place patients at unnecessary risk. There is a critical need for novel methods to identify and monitor drug safety data. Through the infrastructure provided by ClinicalTrials.gov, structured trial results (including safety findings) are now becoming available for an increasing number of trials in a comprehensive and timely fashion. However, access and use of these data in evidence synthesis tasks remain limited. ClinicalTrials.gov is the largest single registry for clinical studies worldwide and includes more than 260,000 registered studies. Of the 108,941 completed trials registered with the site, 20% have uploaded results data for a total of 7.85 million participants. Results data reported on ClinicalTrials.gov have the potential to fill gaps created by delays and biases in published articles and provide an earlier and more complete overview of available trial evidence. We propose to develop novel informatics approaches based on combinations of information retrieval and machine learning methods to facilitate access and analysis of trial results reported in this registry. Focusing on trials testing drug interventions in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and oncology, we perform this work in three specific aims: 1) Develop semi-automated trial screening for identifying and aggregating trials relevant to a clinical intervention; 2) Extract adverse event and safety outcomes data from results reported in the registry; and 3) Perform validation studies to assess detection of adverse events and performance of semi- automated meta-analyses of safety outcomes. Methods developed in this project will facilitate timely, broad- scale use of trial results reported on ClinicalTrials.gov in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data. All methods will be made publicly available in order to support adverse event monitoring and systematic reviews of drug interventions. Project Narrative The availability of results from clinical trials is frequently incomplete or delayed, limiting the evidence available to clinicians making treatment decisions. When results on the safety of interventions, such as drugs, are not properly disseminated, patients may be exposed to harm. National policies require comprehensive and timely reporting of trial results in trial registries (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov), representing a novel data type that could be used for drug safety surveillance. However, the use of these data has remained limited to date. We propose innovative informatics methods to enable access and analysis of this emerging data source in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data.",Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis,9882529,R01LM012976,"['Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Bibliographic Databases', 'Bibliography', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consumption', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug usage', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse event monitoring', 'base', 'cluster trial', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'drug testing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medication safety', 'novel', 'rosiglitazone', 'safety outcomes', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'trial design', 'validation studies', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,328000,-0.03494224028183452
"Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository Three-dimensional anatomic modeling and simulation (3D M&S) in cardiovascular (CV) disease have become a crucial component of treatment planning, medical device design, diagnosis, and FDA approval. Comprehensive, curated 3-D M&S databases are critical to enable grand challenges, and to advance model reduction, shape analysis, and deep learning for clinical application. However, large-scale open data curation involving 3-D M&S present unique challenges; simulations are data intensive, physics-based models are increasingly complex and highly resolved, heterogeneous solvers and data formats are employed by the community, and simulations require significant high-performance computing resources. Manually curating a large open-data repository, while ensuring the contents are verified and credible, is therefore intractable. We aim to overcome these challenges by developing broadly applicable automated curation data science to ensure model credibility and accuracy in 3-D M&S, leveraging our team’s expertise in CV simulation, uncertainty quantification, imaging science, and our existing open data and open source projects. Our team has extensive experience developing and curating open data and software resources. In 2013, we launched the Vascular Model Repository (VMR), providing 120 publicly-available datasets, including medical image data, anatomic vascular models, and blood flow simulation results, spanning numerous vascular anatomies and diseases. The VMR is compatible with SimVascular, the only fully open source platform providing state-of-the-art image-based blood flow modeling and analysis capability to the CV simulation community. We propose that novel curation science will enable the VMR to rapidly intake new data while automatically assessing model credibility, creating a unique resource to foster rigor and reproducibility in the CV disease community with broad application in 3D M&S. To accomplish these goals, we propose three specific aims: 1) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of anatomic patient-specific models built from medical image data, 2) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of 3D blood flow simulation results, 3) Disseminate the data curation suite and expanded VMR. The proposed research is significant and innovative because it will 1) enable rapid expansion of the repository by limiting curator intervention during data intake, leveraging compatibility with SimVascular, 2) increase model credibility in the CV simulation community, 3) apply novel supervised and unsupervised approaches to evaluate anatomic model fidelity, 4) leverage reduced order models for rapid assessment of complex 3D data. This project assembles a unique team of experts in cardiovascular simulation, the developers of SimVascular and creator of the VMR, a professional software engineer, and radiology technologists. We will build upon our successful track record of launching and supporting open source and open data resources to ensure success. Data curation science for 3D M&S will have direct and broad impacts in other physiologic systems and to ultimately impact clinical care in cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular anatomic models and blood flow simulations are increasingly used for personalized surgical planning, medical device design, and the FDA approval process. We propose to develop automated data curation science to rapidly assess credibility of anatomic models and 3D simulation data, which present unique challenges for large-scale data curation. Leveraging our open source SimVascular project, the proposed project will enable rapid expansion of the existing Vascular Model Repository while ensuring model credibility and reproducibility to foster innovation in clinical and basic science cardiovascular research.",Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository,10016840,R01LM013120,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Basic Science', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Engineering', 'Source Code', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'computing resources', 'data curation', 'data format', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gigabyte', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'online repository', 'open data', 'open source', 'repository', 'respiratory', 'shape analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'stem', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'supervised learning', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'unsupervised learning', 'web portal']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,330502,-0.01008001813503518
"N3C & All of Us Research Program Collaborative Project Project Summary/Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented clinical and public health challenges. Though institutions collect large amounts of clinical data about COVID-19 cases, these datasets individually might not be diverse enough to draw population level conclusions. Also, statistical, machine learning, and causal analyses are most successful with large-scale data beyond what is available in any given organization. To tackle this problem, NCATS introduced the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science, community-based initiative to share patient level data for analysis. The initiative requires participating institutions to share information about their COVID-19 patients in a standard-driven way, including demographics, vital signs, diagnoses, laboratory results, medications, and other treatments. The data from multiple institutions will be merged and consolidated, and access will be provided to investigators through a centralized analytical platform. The COVID-19 data sharing collaboration with the N3C initiative offers a mechanism to initiate collaborations with other NIH sponsored data sharing programs, such as the All of Us Research Program (AoURP). This administrative supplement will support efforts to clean and standardize data at VCU, and to transfer it to the N3C data repository. The supplement will also assist in introducing new services at the Wright Center to support our investigators to use the N3C resources. It will also enable collaboration with the AoURP by establishing a pipeline to collect and transmit consented patients' EHR data and by building on existing community outreach pathways to recruit additional participants for the AoURP. The project will be overseen by the PI/Executive Committee and supervised by the Director of Research Informatics. Procedures and services developed at our local CTSA hub will be shared and disseminated to the CTSA network. Project Narrative NIH/NCATS has been working on the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), which aims to build a centralized national data resource to be used by the research community to study the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential treatments as the pandemic continues to evolve. The COVID-19 data sharing collaboration with the N3C initiative also offers a mechanism to initiate collaborations with the All of Us Research Program (AoURP).

"Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Researchers are increasingly working to “mine” health data to derive new medical knowledge. Unlike experimental data that are collected per a research protocol, the primary role of clinical data is to help clinicians care for patients, so the procedures for its collection are not often systematic. Thus, missing and/or biased data can hinder medical knowledge discovery and data mining efforts. Existing efforts for missing health data imputation often focus on only cross-sectional correlation (e.g., correlation across subjects or across variables) but neglect autocorrelation (e.g., correlation across time points). Moreover, they often focus on modeling incompleteness but neglect the biases in health data. Modeling both the incompleteness and bias may contribute to better understanding of health data and better support clinical decision making. We propose a novel framework of Bias-Aware Missing data Imputation with Cross-sectional correlation and Autocorrelation (BAMICA), and leverage clinical notes to better inform the methods that will otherwise rely on structured health data only. In addition to evaluating its imputation accuracy, we will apply the proposed framework to assist in downstream tasks such as predictive modeling for multiple outcomes across a diverse range of clinical and cohort study datasets. Aim 1 introduces the MICA framework to jointly consider cross-sectional correlation and auto-correlation. In Aim 2, we will augment MICA to be bias-aware (hence BAMICA) to account for biases stemmed from multiple roots such as healthcare process and use them as features in imputing missing health data. This augmentation is achieved by a novel recurrent neural network architecture that keeps track of both evolution of health data variables and bias factors. In Aim 3, we will supplement unstructured clinical notes to structured health data for modeling incompleteness and biases using a novel architecture of graph neural network on top of memory network. We will apply graph neural networks to process clinical notes in order to learn proper representations as input to the memory networks for imputation and downstream predictive modeling tasks. Depending on the clinical problem and data availability, not all modules may be needed. Thus our proposed BAMICA framework is designed to be flexible and consists of selectable modules to meet some or all of the above needs. In summary, our proposal bridges a key knowledge gap in jointly modeling incompleteness and biases in health data and utilizes unstructured clinical notes to supplement and augment such modeling in order to better support predictive modeling and clinical decision making. We will demonstrate generalizability by experimenting on four large clinical and cohort study datasets, and by scaling up to the eMERGE network spanning 11 institutions nationwide. We will disseminate the open-source framework. The principled and flexible framework generated by this project will bring significant methodological advancement and have a direct impact on enhancing discovery from health data.

"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9889134,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computational suite', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,356625,-0.00033272829342562827
"Center for Machine Learning in Urology PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to establish an Exploratory Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Benign Urology at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), the central mission of which is to apply machine learning to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and prediction of treatment responses of benign urological disease among children and adults. The proposed CHOP/Penn Center for Machine Learning in Urology (CMLU) addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede the development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. Structurally, urologic research occurs in silos, with little interaction among investigators that study different diseases or different populations (e.g. pediatric and adult). Scientifically, analysis of imaging and other types complex data is limited by inter-observer variability, and incomplete utilization of available information. This proposal overcomes these barriers by applying cutting-edge approaches in machine learning to analyze CT images that are routinely obtained for evaluation of individuals with kidney stone disease. Central to the CHOP/Penn CMLU is the partnership of urologists and experts in machine learning, which will bring a new approach to generating knowledge that advances research and clinical care. In addition, the CMLU will expand the urologic research community by providing a research platform and standalone machine learning executables that could be applied to other datasets. The Center’s mission will be achieved through the following Aims, with progress assessed through systematic evaluation: Aim 1. To expand the research base investigating benign urological disease. We will establish a community with the research base, particularly with the KURe, UroEpi programs, other P20 Centers, and O’Brien Centers. We will build this community by providing mini-coaching clinics to facilitate application of machine learning to individual projects, developing an educational hub for synchronous and asynchronous engagement with the research base, and making freely available all source codes and standalone executables for all machine learning tools. Aim 2. To improve prediction of ureteral stone passage using machine learning of CT images. The CMLU has developed deep learning methods that segment and automate measurement of urinary stones and adjacent renal anatomy. In the Research Project, we will compare these methods to existing segmentation methods and the current gold standard of manual measurement. We will then extract informative features from thousands of CT scans to predict the probability of spontaneous passage of ureteral stones for children and adults evaluated in the CHOP and Penn healthcare systems. Aim 3. To foster collaboration in benign urological disease research across levels of training and centers through an Educational Enrichment Program. We will amplify interactions across institutions and engage investigators locally and nationally by providing summer research internships, and interinstitutional exchange program, and an annual research symposium. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed CHOP/Penn O’Brien Center for Machine Learning in Urology addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan.

"Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance, impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,” given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and interpretation. Preliminary data including drug screening, modeling morphological changes in cancer, cardiac image reconstruction, modeling subcellular organization, and others are discussed. Mathematical data analysis algorithms have enabled great advances in technology for building predictive models from biological data which have been useful for learning about cells and organs, as well as for stratifying patient subgroups in different diseases, and other applications. Given their lack to fundamental biophysics properties, the modeling approaches in current existence (e.g. numerical feature engineering, artificial neural networks) have significant short-comings when applied to biological data analysis problems. The project describes a new mathematical data analysis approach, rooted on transport and related phenomena, which is aimed at greatly enhance our ability to extract meaning from diverse biomedical datasets, while augmenting the accuracy of predictions.",Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science,9874005,R01GM130825,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cartilage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Visualization', 'absorption', 'algorithm development', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biophysical properties', 'brain morphology', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'effectiveness testing', 'electric impedance', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'gray matter', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mathematical theory', 'microscopic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'neural network', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,360227,-0.00761278682954207

"Machine Learning Clinical Order Recommendations for Specialty Consultation Care Summary: Machine Learning Clinical Order Recommendations for Specialty Consultation Care  A future vision of clinical decision support must transcend constraints in scalability, maintainability, and adaptability. The shortage of 100,000 physicians by 2030 reflects unmet (and unlimited) demand for the scarcest healthcare resource, clinical expertise. Over 25 million in the US alone have deficient access to medical specialty care, with delays contributing to 20% higher mortality. There is no quality without access.  Our goal is to develop a radically different paradigm for outpatient specialty consultations by inductively learning clinical workups embedded in clinical data. We focus on predicting the concrete clinical orders for medications and diagnostic tests that result from specialty consultations. This can power a tier of fully automated guides that will enable clinicians to initiate care that would otherwise await in-person specialty visits, opening access for more patients.  The major scientific barriers are advances in data science and decision support methods for collating clinical knowledge, with continuous improvement through clinical experience, crowdsourcing, and machine learning. Our innovative approach is inspired by collaborative filtering algorithms that power “Customers like you also bought this...” recommender systems with the scalability to answer unlimited queries, maintainability through statistical learning, and adaptability to respond to evolving clinical practices.  Our team uniquely combines expertise in clinical medicine, electronic medical records, clinical decision support, statistics and machine learning to enhance medical specialty consultations through aims that seek to: (1) Develop methods to generate clinical decision support by predicting the clinical orders that will result from Endocrinology and Hematology specialty consultations; (2) Evaluate and iteratively design clinical collaborative filtering prototypes based on clinical user input on usability and acceptability; and (3) Determine which consult clinical order patterns are associated with better results through reinforcement learning and causal inference frameworks. Completion of these aims will yield a sustained, powerful impact on clinical information retrieval and knowledge discovery for synthesizing clinical practices from real-world data. By addressing grand challenges in clinical decision support, adoption of these methods will fulfill a vision that empowers clinicians to practice to the top of their license, making healthcare more scalable in reach, responsiveness, and reproducibility Project Narrative There can be no quality without access, and over 25 million in the US alone have deficient access to the scarcest healthcare resource: Human medical expertise. Building on methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed research will automatically learn practice patterns from electronic medical records.

"Sleep Health Profiles in Middle-aged Workers in Relation to Cardiovascular and Cognitive Health Middle-aged workers are vulnerable to having poor sleep, which is a public concern as it may lead to decreased productivity at work and increased risks of health problems over time. Most studies have associated one aspect of sleep (often focusing on sleep duration) with work or health-related variables, lacking a comprehensive understanding of how the combinations of multiple dimensions of sleep within individuals are associated with work-related stress and health outcomes. For example, a combination of sufficient sleep duration, regular sleep/wake, efficient sleep, and no insomnia symptom may be more predictive of concurrent and later cardiovascular and cognitive health than sleep duration alone. We propose to use multidimensional sleep health profiles that measure “which” and “how many” sleep problems co-occur within individuals. Harmonizing two independent project data sets from the Midlife in the United States Study (MIDUS) and Work, Family & Health Study (WFHS), the proposed study aims at examining the relationships between work-to-nonwork conflict (work stress carried over to and interfering with family and personal activities including sleep), sleep health profiles, and cardiovascular and cognitive health. Aim 1 will identify sleep health profiles in middle-aged workers and examine the associations of work-to-nonwork conflict with the sleep health profiles. Using extensive measures of self- reported and actigraphy-measured sleep, we will identify a priori-defined and empirically-derived sleep health profiles in diverse forms and will evaluate reproducibility of sleep health profiles across MIDUS and WFHS samples. Aim 2 will examine the associations of the sleep health profiles with cardiovascular health outcomes. Taking advantage of two cohorts in MIDUS that were sampled before and after the U.S. Great Recession period (2007-2009), we will also examine the health impacts of a macro- level stressor, whether those who were exposed to the economic recession exhibit a stronger link between sleep health profiles and cardiovascular outcomes than a propensity-matched sample who were not exposed to the recession but otherwise equal on all observables. Aim 3 will further examine the associations of the sleep health profiles with cognitive outcomes, leveraging MIDUS longitudinal cognitive data that include objectively measured episodic memory and executive functioning. We will also explore (1) whether sleep health profiles mediate the relationships between work-related stress (work-to-nonwork conflict) and cardiovascular and cognitive health, (2) potential moderation by sex and race, and (3) daily characteristics that predict optimal sleep health nights (using machine-learning). The proposed sleep health profiles can be broadly used to improve prediction accuracy in health screening tools. Focusing on middle-aged workers will contribute to decreasing health disparities in the workforce and promoting work productivity and healthy aging. Findings will inform the development of sleep-focused interventions to improve sleep and health among middle-aged workers who are in greater need. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of sleep health profiles among U.S. middle-aged workers is expected to increase understanding of how the combinations of multiple sleep characteristics relate to work-related stress and cardiovascular and cognitive health. The identified sleep health profile can be broadly used to improve prediction accuracy in health screening tools and can provide a basis for developing population-level sleep health interventions.

"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,10024094,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Body part', 'Cannabidiol', 'Carbamazepine', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clonazepam', 'Clonus', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Face', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phenytoin', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Specificity', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Valproic Acid', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'comorbidity', 'drug use screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'selective expression', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,422740,-0.005142827672479182
"Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach PROJECT ABSTRACT The potential for artificial intelligence applications, specifically machine learning, to prevent, predict, and help manage disease sparks immense hope not only for the individuals affected, but also for the overall health of populations. Particularly exciting examples of these novel computing strategies are increasingly found in the development of deep learning algorithms for medical use. Already embedded in our daily lives, algorithms have begun to impact human-decision making, from recruitment and hiring of employees to criminal sentencing. Outside of medicine, recognition of the ways algorithms may reflect, reproduce, and perpetuate bias has led to an explosion of theoretical and empirical research on the subject. There is an increasing awareness of potential algorithmic weaknesses, including some that raise concerns about fundamental issues of fairness, justice, and bias. The need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues in algorithmic medicine is time- sensitive. As health care systems increasingly utilize algorithms for patient identification, diagnosis, and treatment direction, the consequences of algorithmic bias yield real and significant costs. Numerous stakeholders are responsible for the development, application and interpretation of algorithms in medicine, and yet there has been very little engagement of stakeholders most affected by these learning systems and tools. The overarching goal of this empirical and hypothesis driven project is to articulate the landscape of ethical concerns and the issues emerging in the context of the development, refinement, and application of machine learning in algorithmic medicine. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in the development, refinement, and application of machine learning, by querying the perspectives of a diverse array of stakeholders involved—machine learning researchers, clinicians, ethicists, and patients. Using the new insights generated from the first half, we will conduct an evidence-based, information-sharing vignette survey to understand the impact of the contexts of algorithms on the ethically salient perspectives of physicians—those poised to implement such innovation in their own decision-making for the care of patients. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional machine learning research conducted at Stanford University, including work by NIH-funded investigators, and provides extensive, systematically collected data on ethical issues encountered and anticipated throughout the development and implementation of algorithms. Finally, the project develops and refines an evidence-informed information-sharing survey for use in better understanding how physicians react to intelligent systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Machine learning-driven algorithmic medicine now faces an urgent need to anticipate and address emerging ethical issues. For machine learning applications in algorithmic medicine, the failure to examine ethical issues from the perspective of stakeholders will inevitably limit the ecological validity and utility of the algorithms and threaten society's future embrace of these innovations. A hypothesis-driven, empirical study is needed to anticipate and address ethical concerns, and provide clinicians, machine learning researchers, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical application and translation of algorithms in medicine.",Stakeholder Guidance to Anticipate and Address Ethical Challenges in Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Algorithmic Medicine: a Novel Empirical Approach,10099785,R01TR003505,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disclosure', 'Disease Management', 'Effectiveness', 'Empirical Research', 'Employee', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethicists', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Familiarity', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Justice', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'court', 'deep learning algorithm', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool']",NCATS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,429327,0.01570121734756568
"Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Over 5.4 million cases of keratinocyte cancers (basal and squamous cell) are diagnosed annually and incidence of melanoma has increased 3% each year for the past 30 years. In the 2014 Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer, the U. S. Surgeon General included strategies for coordinating messages on sun safety and physical activity, recognizing the need for sun safety among populations that engage in physical activity outdoors. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer; individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn. Melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Strava, a tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of mobile technologies for logging physical activity and providing social feedback on activities by other Strava users. The goal of this R21 research is to test the feasibility of interfacing with the Strava website and its mobile app to develop an algorithm that a) predicts when individuals are likely to be engaged in physical activity outdoors in the sun when ultraviolet radiation is high and b) delivers sun safety advice tailored to the time, location, and personal risk (e.g., skin sun sensitivity) of the Strava users. Concept focus groups with Strava users (n=16) and non-users (n=16) will provide input on the feasibility, content, and functions in the Strava Sun (SS) intervention. The algorithm that predicts future outdoor exercise will be developed using machine learning modeling on activity data provided by Strava users (n=1000). The SS intervention will be programmed to deliver ecologically-valid sun safety advice through Strava's open-source Applications Programming Interface (API) via email and comments in the Strava interface. The sun safety advice will be tailored to location, time, season and user's personal risk, employing advice algorithms we developed for a sun safety mobile app, sunZapp, and a social media message library in our Go Sun Smart intervention for outdoor recreation resorts. SS will be tested for usability (n=30 Strava users) prior to conducting a pilot field trial to establish feasibility of SS in practice (n=226 Strava users). The project is significant and innovative. A sun protection interface for the Strava platform will provide individuals who engage in regular physical activity personalized, ecologically-valid advice to help them practice sun safety during outdoor activities. It will contain a novel machine learning algorithm that predicts future high-risk behavior, i.e., outdoor physical activity, to provide precision prevention advice. The intervention will be delivered over an established and popular technology platform with over 42 million registered users. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer and individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn, a proximal biomarker of melanoma risk, perhaps explaining why melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Mobile technology for tracking physical activity has become increasingly prevalent and Strava, an activity tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of these technologies. This research will test the feasibility of delivering location-based, ecologically-valid sun safety advice to Strava users at times when they are predicted to be engaged in outdoor physical activity, by utilizing Strava's public open-source Applications Programming Interface.",Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava,10057198,R21CA241637,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Basal Cell', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cancer Control', 'Cessation of life', 'Colorado', 'Connecticut', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Electronic Mail', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'High Prevalence', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Photosensitivity', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protective Clothing', 'Published Comment', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Self Efficacy', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Social Network', 'Software Engineering', 'Squamous Cell', 'Sun Exposure', 'Sunburn', 'Sunscreening Agents', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'United States', 'anticancer research', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'data access', 'data format', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'forgetting', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'interest', 'keratinocyte', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'melanoma biomarkers', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'safety practice', 'skill acquisition', 'skin cancer prevention', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'sun protection', 'sun safety', 'usability', 'web site', 'willingness']",NCI,"KLEIN BUENDEL, INC.",R21,2020,444313,-0.03150329738001716
"Next generation machine vision for automated behavioral phenotyping of knock-in ALS-FTD mouse models Project Summary Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia FTD are devastating neurodegenerative disorders that lie on a genetic and mechanistic continuum. ALS is a disease of motor neurons that that is almost uniformly lethal within only 3-5 years of diagnosis. FTD is a heterogeneous, rapidly progressing syndrome that is among the top three causes of presenile dementia. About 10% of ALS cases are caused by dominantly transmitted gene defects. SOD1 and FUS mutations cause aggressive motor neuron pathology while TDP43 mutations cause ALS-FTD. Further, wild type FUS and TDP43 are components of abnormal inclusions in many FTD cases, suggesting a mechanistic link between these disorders. Early phenotypes are of particular interest because these could lead to targeted interventions aimed at the root cause of the disorder that could stem the currently inexorable disease progression. Elucidating such early, potentially shared characteristics of these disorders should be greatly aided by: 1) knock-in animal models expressing familial ALS-FTD genes; 2) sensitive, rigorous and objective behavioral phenotyping methods to analyze and compare models generated in different laboratories. In published work the co-PIs applied their first-generation, machine vision-based automated phenotyping method, ACBM ‘1.0’ (automated continuous behavioral monitoring) to detect and quantify the earliest-observed phenotypes in Tdp43Q331K knock-in mice. This method entails continuous video recording for 5 days to generate >14 million frames/mouse. These videos are then scored by a trained computer vision system. In addition to its sensitivity, objectivity and reproducibility, a major advantage of this method is the ability to acquire and archive video recordings and to analyze the data at sites, including the Cloud, remote from those of acquisition. We will use Google Cloud TPUs supercomputers that have been designed from the ground up to accelerate cutting-edge machine learning workloads, with a special focus on deep learning. We will analyze this data using Bayesian hierarchical spline models that describe the different mouse behaviors along the circadian rhythm. The current proposal has two main goals: 1) Use deep learning to refine and apply a Next Generation ACBM - ‘2.0’ - that will allow for more sensitive, expansive and robust automated behavioral phenotyping of four novel knock-in models along with the well characterized SOD1G93A transgenic mouse. 2) To establish and validate procedures to enable remote acquisition of video recording data with cloud-based analysis. Our vision is to establish sensitive, robust, objective, and open-source machine vision-based behavioral analysis tools that will be widely available to researchers in the field. Since all the computer-annotated video data is standardized in ACBM 2.0 and will be archived, we envision a searchable ‘behavioral database’, that can be freely mined and analyzed. Such tools are critical to accelerate the development of novel and effective therapeutics for ALS-FTD. Narrative ALS and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are devastating, rapidly progressing diseases and current treatments are of limited value. In this proposal a neuroscientist and a computer scientist have teamed up to develop a new machine vision-based method for behavioral analysis novel mouse models of ALS-FTD. The ultimate goal is to reveal early phenotypes in ALS-FTD models that can be used in understanding disease pathology and in the development of new therapeutic targets.",Next generation machine vision for automated behavioral phenotyping of knock-in ALS-FTD mouse models,9979408,R21NS112743,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Expression Profiling', 'Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Paralysed', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Presenile Dementia', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Paralysis', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'TensorFlow', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cloud based', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'design', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'interest', 'knockin animal', 'machine vision', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'protein TDP-43', 'stem', 'supercomputer', 'superoxide dismutase 1', 'tool']",NINDS,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,446875,-0.013168179800585204
"Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data Project Summary This project develops novel statistical inference procedures for biomedical big data (BBD), including data from diverse omics platforms, various medical imaging technologies and electronic health records. Statistical inference, i.e., assess- ing uncertainty, statistical signiﬁcance and conﬁdence, is a key step in computational pipelines that aim to discover new disease mechanisms and develop effective treatments using BBD. However, the development of statistical inference procedures for BBD has lagged behind technological advances. In fact, while point estimation and variable selection procedures for BBD have matured over the past two decades, existing inference procedures are either limited to simple methods for marginal inference and/or lack the ability to integrate biomedical data across multiple studies and plat- forms. This paucity is, in large part, due to the challenges of statistical inference in high-dimensional models, where the number of features is considerably larger than the number of subjects in the study. Motivated by our team's extensive and complementary expertise in analyzing multi-omics data from heterogenous studies, including the TOPMed project on which multiple team members currently collaborate, the current proposal aims to address these challenges. The ﬁrst aim of the project develops a novel inference procedure for conditional parameters in high-dimensional models based on dimension reduction, which facilitates seamless integration of external biological information, as well as biomedical data across multiple studies and platforms. To expand the application of this method to very high-dimensional models that arise in BBD applications, the second aim develops a data-adaptive screening procedure for selecting an optimal subset of relevant variables. The third aim develops a novel inference procedure for high-dimensional mixed linear models. This method expands the application domain of high-dimensional inference procedures to studies with longitu- dinal data and repeated measures, which arise commonly in biomedical applications. The fourth aim develops a novel data-driven procedure for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), which facilitates the integration of evidence from multiple BBD sources, while minimizing the false negative rate (FNR) for optimal discovery. Upon evaluation using ex- tensive simulation experiments and application to multi-omics data from the TOPMed project, the last aim implements the proposed methods into easy-to-use open-source software tools leveraging the R programming language and the capabilities of the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments for BBD methods and tools. Public Health Relevance Biomedical big data (BBD), including large collections of omics data, medical imaging data, and electronic health records, offer unprecedented opportunities for discovering disease mechanisms and developing effective treatments. However, despite their tremendous potential, discovery using BBD has been hindered by computational challenges, including limited advances in statistical inference procedures that allow biomedical researchers to investigate uncon- founded associations among biomarkers of interest and various biological phenotypes, while integrating data from multiple BBD sources. The current proposal bridges this gap by developing novel statistical machine learning methods and easy-to-use open-source software for statistical inference in BBD, which are designed to facilitate the integration of data from multiple studies and platforms.",Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data,9969887,R01GM133848,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Galaxy', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Linear Models', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'R programming language ', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'computational pipelines', 'data integration', 'design', 'diverse data', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,456980,0.004754086865359984
"Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP Project Summary  Natural language processing (NLP) technology is now widespread (e.g. Google Translate) and has several important applications in biomedical research. We propose a new target for NLP: extraction of scientific questions stated in publications. A system that automatically captures and organizes scientific questions from across the biomedical literature could have a wide range of significant impacts, as attested to in our diverse collection of support letters from researchers, journal editors, educators and scientific foundations. Prior work focused on making binary (or probabilistic) assessments of whether a text is hedged or uncertain, with the goal of downgrading such statements in information extraction tasks—not computationally capturing what the uncertainty is about. In contrast, we propose an ambitious plan to identify, represent, integrate and reason about the content of scientific questions, and to demonstrate how this approach can be used to address two important new use cases in biomedical research: contextualizing experimental results and enhancing literature awareness. Contextualizing results is the task of linking elements of genome-scale results to open questions across all of biomedical research. Literature awareness is the ability to understand important characteristics of large, dynamic collections of research publications as a whole. We propose to produce rich computational representations of the dynamic evolution of research questions, and to prototype textual and visual interfaces to help students and researchers explore and develop a detailed understanding of key open scientific questions in any area of biomedical research. Project Narrative The scientific literature is full of statements of important unsolved questions. By using artificial intelligence systems to identify and categorize these questions, the proposed work would help other researchers discover when their findings might address an important question in another scientific area. This work would also make it easier for students, journal editors, conference organizers and others understand where science is headed by tracking the evolution of scientific questions.",Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP,10069773,R01LM013400,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Biomedical Research', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Information Retrieval', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Students', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Work', 'design', 'dynamical evolution', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'journal article', 'news', 'novel', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prototype', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,462393,0.016780635855701165
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples and directly translating this ‘omics data into useful biological inference.

"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,9979940,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative treatment', 'data streams', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'national surveillance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,485987,0.011498520927176084
"Predicting Human Olfactory Perception from Molecular Structure PROJECT SUMMARY Modern technology makes it possible to capture a visual scene as a photograph, alter it, send it to another country nearly instantaneously, and store it without concern for degradation. None of this is currently possible in olfaction. Although perfumers and flavorists are adept at mixing odorous molecules to produce a desired perceptual effect, the rules underlying this process are poorly understood at a quantitative level. Current methods for displaying odors to a subject are akin to requiring a Polaroid of every visual stimulus of interest. A more efficient method for probing the olfactory system would be to use a set of 'primary odors'—some limited number of odors from which all other complex odors could be reproduced by appropriate mixtures. Both auditory and visual stimuli have been digitized, and this will eventually be possible in olfaction as well. Predicting odor from chemical structure has been a problem in the field since its inception, but recent advances in machine learning algorithms have made great progress in analogous problems, such as facial recognition. The research proposed here will combine these machine learning techniques with high quality human psychophysics to understand how to predict the smell of a molecule or mixture of odorants, which will ultimately help improve our understanding of disease diagnosis using odors as well as eating-related health and illness. HEALTH RELEVANCE The sense of smell plays a critical role in preferences and aversions for specific foods. The proposed research will combine machine learning techniques with high quality human psychophysics to create a model that can predict the smell of odorous molecules. This model will allow us to describe and control odors, which will increase our understanding of food preference and eating-related health and wellness.",Predicting Human Olfactory Perception from Molecular Structure,9887973,R01DC017757,"['Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-linear Models', 'Numerical value', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'auditory stimulus', 'base', 'computer monitor', 'disease diagnosis', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in silico', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'novel', 'physical property', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'preference', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'single molecule', 'visual stimulus']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,R01,2020,496911,-0.02203282776685944
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders.

"CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare Project Summary Wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to huge clinical databases, which enable the rapid growth of healthcare analytics market. One particular challenge for analyzing EHRs data is that much detailed patient information is embedded in clinical documents and not directly available for downstream analysis. Therefore, clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information embedded in clinical narratives, have received great attention, with an estimated global market of $2.65 billion by 2021 . In our previous work, we have developed CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing), a clinical NLP tool with demonstrated superior performance through multiple international NLP challenges and a large user community (over 1,500 downloads by users from over 700 organizations). Commercialization of CLAMP by Melax Technologies Inc. has been successful (i.e., with a dozen licensed customers now); but it also reveals its limitations as a desktop application in the Cloud era. Therefore, we propose to extend CLAMP to a new Cloud- based, Service-oriented platform (called CLAMP-CS), which will address the identified challenges by: 1) improving clinical NLP performance and reducing annotation cost by leveraging the state-of-the-art algorithms such as deep learning, active learning and transfer learning and making them accessible to less experienced users; 2) following new service-oriented architectures to make CLAMP-CS available via SaaS and PaaS, ready for Cloud-based development and deployment; and 3) improving CLAMP-CS interoperability with downstream applications following two widely used standard representations: HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP CMD (Common Data Model), to support the use cases in clinical operations and research respectively. With these advanced features, we believe CLAMP-CS will be a leading clinical NLP system in the market and it will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical/translational research. Project Narrative In this study, we plan to develop a new clinical natural language processing (NLP) tool based on the existing widely used CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing) system, to support enterprise development and deployment of NLP solutions in healthcare. We believe that the new generation of Cloud- based, service-oriented NLP tool will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical and translational research.","CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare",10011177,R44TR003254,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Belief', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Administration', 'International', 'Language', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Operations Research', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Records', 'Research', 'Services', 'System', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'language training', 'learning algorithm', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid growth', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NCATS,"MELAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2020,503546,0.022271866684936442
"Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data Abstract Eysz, Inc. is developing an algorithm and software solutions to reliably and affordably detect seizures in an ambulatory setting using existing smart glass technologies. In a proof-of-concept study, Eysz was able to detect >75% of all absence seizures longer than 10 s in duration using only oculometric variables (e.g., pupil size, pupil location, eccentricity, blink frequency) detected using off-the-shelf eye-tracking technology. Eysz seeks to build on this finding by developing and commercializing highly sensitive and specific seizure detection algorithms using eye-movement data as input, with eventual expansion to additional seizure types. This technology has the potential to transform the detection and treatment of seizures for those with epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Timely treatment can reduce the chance of additional seizures by half, making early detection and treatment critical. Unfortunately, detection and diagnosis can be difficult using current technologies, especially in types of epilepsy with few observable symptoms such as absence seizures. The gold standard for detecting and characterizing seizure activity is electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with video and subsequent review by a trained clinician, but this does not translate well to the outpatient setting. While attempts to develop ambulatory EEGs have been made, these have significant drawbacks, including poor patient acceptability, poor detection capability, and continued reliance on asynchronous review. Additional non-EEG- based motion detection devices are limited to tonic-clonic seizures, which are responsible for a small fraction of all seizure activity. Thus, there is a critical need to reliably detect seizures outside of the clinic to provide physicians with necessary information to guide therapeutic decision making. To address this need, Eysz is developing a digital health platform that leverages existing eye tracking technology to meet this significant unmet gap in the market and is technically feasible, capital-efficient, robust, and innovative. Eysz plans to use existing smart glass technology to export the necessary oculometric data to be analyzed by our seizure detection algorithm. We will also build out databases, software systems, and user interfaces enabling the resulting data to be stored in the cloud and visualized/analyzed by physicians. In this Phase I SBIR, Eysz will advance the development of the seizure detection algorithms by: 1) obtaining oculometric video and EEG data on ≥100 absence seizures from multiple patients, and 2) using ML and statistical methods to optimize an algorithm for identifying absence seizures using eye-tracking data, with a target sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%. Lessons learned from this study will be applied (with different training sets) to additional seizures types, such as focal impaired awareness (formerly called complex partial) seizures, the most prevalent seizure type in adults. This work is of critical importance to the field, as demonstrated by support from the Epilepsy Foundation and receipt of both the judges' and people's choice awards in the Epilepsy Foundation's 8th Annual Shark Tank Competition. Narrative More than 70 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition that results in significant disability and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Seizure detection and characterization is critical to choosing an appropriate treatment regimen, and appropriate anticonvulsants can decrease seizures by 50%. Eysz's proposed seizure detection solution will provide unobtrusive, objective, automated detection of seizure activity in an outpatient setting in near real time, improving medical decision- making, decreasing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and ultimately improving quality of life for those with epilepsy.",Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data,10153499,R43NS119015,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Blinking', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Epilepsy', 'Eye Movements', 'Focal Seizure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Shark', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tonic - clonic seizures', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'commercialization', 'digital', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'premature', 'prospective', 'software systems', 'statistical and machine learning', 'visual tracking', 'wearable device']",NINDS,"EYSZ, INC.",R43,2020,511154,-0.013793158997159976
"Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study ABSTRACT When life stresses are especially intense, chronic, or overwhelming, deleterious health effects can occur, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, disability, depression, low quality of life, and dementia. In this context, resilience can be defined as the ability to maintain a healthy aging trajectory despite adverse conditions of stress. American Indians (AI) have a unique history and ongoing experience of trauma and disparities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions, which amplify daily stresses and contribute to health risks. Despite these adverse circumstances, remarkable resilience has been described in AI populations. Recent work by our group suggests that social support and alignment with Native culture correlate with lower levels of stress, negativity, anger, hostility, depression, mortality, and cardiovascular disease. However, our findings on cultural alignment are limited, and none has yet explored associations of resilience and social support. It remains an open question whether neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) can result from chronic stress, or whether individual psychosocial characteristics such as resilience can mediate such risk. We propose to address these knowledge gaps by efficiently leveraging an existing effort funded by the NHLBI in the Strong Heart Study, a longitudinal cohort of AI adults from 13 tribal communities across the US. The existing contract covers recruitment, consenting, and basic clinical examination of 3,000 eligible participants in 2022-2024; we propose to augment the limited protocol by administering additional psychosocial and neuropsychological instruments on resilience, social support, cultural identity and alignment, and cognition. Our Specific Aims are to: describe associations of individual resilience among AI adults with identity and self-regard, social support, and cultural alignment, by age and sex; evaluate resilience, social support, and cultural features in relation to ADRD; and use machine learning to develop explanatory models of resilience and dementia. Our study has the potential to advance epidemiologic knowledge of modifiable psychosocial conditions in a vulnerable, underserved population, and consequently to offer a clearer picture of the relative contributions of psychosocial, behavioral, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors related to ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic stress can result in negative health effects, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); American Indian (AI) populations have endured excess stresses and traumas, but have also shown remarkable psychosocial resilience, which may be related to robust social support, community environment, cultural identity. It is unclear which of these psychosocial features may be most predictive of psychosocial resilience in AI adults, or whether any is protective against neurodegeneration and ADRD. A search on NIH Reporter uncovered many projects focused on cognitive reserve—sometimes also called resilience—but none on psychosocial resilience or its related features as protective health characteristics in adult AIs. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap with novel data collection and analysis on trait-based psychosocial resilience, related features, cognitive function, and ADRD in 3000 adult AIs as part of the ongoing Strong Heart Study.","Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study",10126397,R01AG070822,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American Indians', 'Anger', 'Anthropology', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hostility', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Navajo', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Persons', 'Philosophy', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Spirituality', 'Stress', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Tribes', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'base', 'bullying', 'clinical examination', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohort', 'disability', 'eligible participant', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'instrument', 'intergenerational', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimism', 'practical application', 'psychosocial', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'trait', 'tribal community']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,521320,-0.024979636670901053
"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9977220,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data dissemination', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,550000,0.0003399656103933519
"A Transfer Learning Framework for Creating Subject-Specific Musculoskeletal Models of the Hand PROJECT SUMMARY Restoring hand function remains an elusive goal for many clinical conditions, including stroke, osteoarthritis, tetraplegia, amputation, and traumatic injury. The hand’s anatomical complexity makes restoring hand function particularly challenging because altering any one parameter in the hand can have cascading effects that are difficult to predict, but essential to control. In this proposal, as a critical step toward informing personalized treatments for the hand, we will study how subject-specific differences influence hand function. Completion of this proposal will rely on collection of three datasets that are designed to provide varying levels of biomechanical detail and require varying levels of effort to collect. Briefly, these datasets include (1) a simulation dataset containing 500,000 simulations fully describing all musculoskeletal parameters involved in hand force production, (2) a dense, biomechanical datasets that describes the kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity required for hand force production in 30 adults, and (3) a sparse, clinically-inspired dataset that describes demographics, anthropometrics, and clinical metrics of hand function in 1000 adults. In Aim 1, we will leverage the first two datasets to design a data-driven analysis framework that identifies the most important biomechanical parameter(s) and maps how those parameters influence hand force production. Completion of this aim will elucidate the biomechanical mechanisms that modulate hand force production and evaluate the ability to use simulation data, instead of experimental data, to identify these mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will leverage all three datasets to create a transfer learning framework capable of efficiently and accurately predicting subject-specific muscle force-generating parameters from easy to collect clinical data. We specifically focus on muscle force- generating parameters because these parameters remain challenging to quickly and accurately estimate, are known to vary across the population, and are highly related to functional metrics like strength. Completion of this aim will provide a new approach for rapidly estimating subject-specific musculoskeletal parameters, thereby enabling efficient creation of subject-specific models and potentially catalyzing use of such models in a clinical setting. Overall, the results from this study could enhance our ability to provide personalized diagnoses and prognoses for individuals suffering from hand impairments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to understand the biomechanical mechanisms underlying force production in the hand. Specifically, we utilize machine learning methods to examine how subject-specific differences influence hand force production and create subject-specific computer models from easy to obtain clinical data. The results, which integrate modeling with an individual’s clinical data, could enhance our ability to provide personalized diagnoses and prognoses for individuals suffering from hand impairments.",A Transfer Learning Framework for Creating Subject-Specific Musculoskeletal Models of the Hand,10040078,R21EB030068,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amputation', 'Anatomy', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diagnostic', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand Strength', 'Hand functions', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Production', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quadriplegia', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Stroke', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Testing', 'Traumatic injury', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'bone', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'design', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'hand dysfunction', 'hand rehabilitation', 'individual patient', 'kinematics', 'machine learning method', 'motor control', 'neural network', 'neuromuscular', 'novel strategies', 'open-access repositories', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'random forest', 'simulation', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2020,560939,-0.005377254867883685
"Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks to develop a resource for the preservation of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This insect is a foundational model organism for biological research. Over a century of work, an enormous number of fly strains harboring different mutant alleles or transgenic constructs have been generated. However, one limitation of working with flies is that there is as yet no practical method for cryopreservation of Drosophila strains. Conventional methods of vitrifying Drosophila were developed in the early 1990s and were never widely adopted due to the difficulty in performing the protocols. This is a problem from a practical perspective since all these strains need to be individually maintained in continuous culture at substantial cost and labor, and also from a scientific perspective, since in the process of continuous culture mutations can accumulate and contamination can occur, degrading the value of these resources for future experiments. A novel approach for cryopreservation of Drosophila is proposed for this R24 resource center. Isolated embryonic nuclei, rather than intact embryos, will be cryopreserved and then nuclear transplantation via microinjection will be used to create clones derived from the cryopreserved nuclei. This approach avoids the issues associated with the impermeability of embryonic membranes that have prevented the use of conventional cryopreservation approaches that have been used with other organisms. Embryonic nuclei will be cryopreserved using a naturally inspired approach. Diverse biological systems (plants, insects, etc.) survive dehydration, drought, freezing temperatures and other stresses through the use of osmolytes. On an applied level, the proposed investigation has the potential to transform preservation of Drosophila lines by 1) preserving subcellular components (specifically nuclei) as opposed to embryos; and 2) automating much of the workflow. In the long- term, the goal of this resource center is to develop a robust and scalable protocol for cryopreservation of Drosophila, thus reducing the cost and improving the quality of long-term strain maintenance. PROJECT NARRATIVE The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a very important model organism for biomedical research. The goal of this resource center is to develop effective methods of preserving fruit flies in order to lower the costs and improve the quality of stock maintenance. The approach leverages recent scientific advances to develop a new, highly automated approach for preserving fruit flies.",Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster,9935719,R24OD028444,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Asses', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Cryopreservation', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Droughts', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Organism', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cold temperature', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'individual response', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nuclear transfer', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'tool']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R24,2020,599090,-0.0005844284097140469
"Development and Deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Driven Methods to Enable Chest X-ray Radiography as an Alternative Diagnostic Method for COVID-19 Pneumonia ABSTRACT In this competitive revision, within the same scope of developing and deploying algorithms to make a quantum leap in clinical diagnosis as that in our current U01EB021183, we would like to revise the original aims to add a new Aim to leverage our expertise in the areas of algorithm development and clinical translation to make immediate contributions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine The application of new computerized methods of data analysis to vast collections of medical, biological, and other data is emerging as a central feature of a broad vision of precision medicine (PM) in which systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) assist clinicians in treatment, diagnosis, or prognosis. The use of AI to analyze big data for clinical decision-making opens up a new domain for ELSI inquiry to address a possible future when the implications of genetics and genomics become embedded into algorithms, pervasive yet implicit and difficult to identify. Thus, an important target of inquiry is the development and developers of these algorithms. There are three distinctive features of the application of AI, and in particular machine learning (ML), to the domain of PM that create the need for ELSI inquiry. First, the process of developing ML-based systems for PM goals is technically and organizationally complex. Thus, members of development teams will likely have different expertise and assumptions about norms, responsibilities, and regulation. Second, machine learning does not solely operate through predetermined rules, and is thus difficult to hold accountable for its conclusions or reasoning. Third, designers of ML systems for PM may be subject to diverse and divergent interests and needs of multiple stakeholders, yet unaware of the associated ethical and values implications for design. These distinctive features of ML in PM could lead to difficulties in detecting misalignment of design with values, and to breakdown in responsibility for realignment. Because machine learning in the context of precision medicine is such a new phenomenon, we have very little understanding of actual practices, work processes and the specific contexts in which design decisions are made. Importantly, we have little knowledge about the influences and constraints on these decisions, and how they intersect with values and ethical principles. Although the field of machine learning for precision medicine is still in its formative stage, there is growing recognition that designers of AI systems have responsibilities to ask such questions about values and ethics. In order to ask these questions, designers must first be aware that there are values expressed by design. Yet, there are few practical options for designers to learn how to increase awareness. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 To map the current state of ML in PM by identifying and cataloging existing US-based ML in PM  projects and by exploring a range of values expressed by stakeholders about the use of ML in PM through  a combination of multi-method review, and interviews of key informants and stakeholders. Aim 2 To characterize decisions and rationales that shape ML in PM and explore whether and how  developers perceive values as part of these rationales through interviews of ML developers and site visits. Aim 3 To explore the feasibility of using design rationale as a framework for increasing awareness of the  existence of values, and multiple sources of values, in decisions about ML in PM through group-based  exercises with ML developers from academic and commercial settings. The overall goal of this project is to understand how to encourage and enable people who are developing artificial intelligence for personalized health care to be aware of values in their daily practice. We will examine actual practices and contexts in which design decisions are made for precision medicine applications, and use this information to design group-based workshop exercises to increase awareness of values.",Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,9941090,R01HG010476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'new technology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized health care', 'precision medicine']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,605875,0.01820655418601596
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years. This work will advance translational science in SUD research and markedly reduce the gap between SUD research and clinical practice -- with a focus on scaling-up and sustaining best practices.",Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network,10161464,UG1DA040309,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Community Networks', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Drug abuse', 'Experimental Designs', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Fire - disasters', 'Funding', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Maine', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'National Clinical Trials Network', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New Hampshire', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Science', 'Security', 'Series', 'Strategic Planning', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vermont', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'chronic pain', 'clinical practice', 'cocaine use', 'college', 'community organizations', 'comorbidity', 'data privacy', 'design', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care settings', 'health data', 'high risk population', 'high school', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'marijuana use', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'personalized health care', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'randomized trial', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'research study', 'rural setting', 'scale up', 'screening', 'smart watch', 'social media', 'special interest group', 'telehealth', 'treatment disparity', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,UG1,2020,622500,-0.012013243826948006
"BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19 Abstract With South Carolina’s population already being vulnerable to poor health as evidenced by poor national health rankings, challenging rural geography and health professional shortages, the impact of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be long lasting in the state. Patient morbidity and mortality rates already continue to increase, with ongoing economic damage to health systems and businesses. The speed of transmission and geographical spread of COVID-19 across South Carolina and the United States is alarming, which combined with the novel nature of the disease justifies the need for accelerated research to combat this pandemic. As clinicians and frontline health workers battle to save lives, creating a data environment that accelerates research is key, and necessary to battle the disease. Access to such information will equip frontline health workers to continue the fight against the disease. This proposal will build the capacity for accelerated research and intelligence gathering by coalescing multiple state partners and leveraging relevant data for discoveries around COVID-19. To accomplish this, this proposal aims to (1) create a de-identified linked database system via REDCap and a mobile application (app) to collate surveillance, clinical, multi-omics and geospatial data on both COVID-19 patients and health workers treating COVID-19 patients in South Carolina; (2) examine the natural history of COVID-19 including transmission dynamics, disease progression, and geospatial visualization; and (3) identify important predictors of short- and long-term clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in South Carolina using machine learning algorithms. These aims will be accomplished through collaborations with multiple state agencies and stakeholders relevant to COVID-19 and the creation of a REDCap database and mobile app that allow for coalescing relevant data in a timely fashion, combined with leveraging of statewide integrated data warehouse capabilities. Project Narrative COVID-19 represents an opportunity to create and deploy a research system that allows accelerated research on any pandemic. While South Carolina is rural in nature, and has low health rankings, it has a powerful integrated health data infrastructure that allows for tracking short-and long-term clinical and health system impacts of pandemics like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The creation of multiple data sources at the individual level, coupled with innovative big data science techniques will advance important discoveries in disease surveillance, transmission, natural history and progression important for treatment and necessary for targeted intervention purposes in South Carolina.","BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19",10136980,R01AI127203,"['2019-nCoV', 'Active Learning', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Common Cold', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality of Patient Information', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Sources', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Partners', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rural', 'SARS coronavirus', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Source', 'South Carolina', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Virus', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'big-data science', 'combat', 'data infrastructure', 'data management', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene therapy', 'health data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data sources', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'patient privacy', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'systems research', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'virology']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2020,626275,0.0006413656478034727
"NorthStar Node of the Clinical Trials Network Since joining the NIDA National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) in 2015, the NorthStar Node has made significant contributions to the objectives and priorities of the CTN. The NorthStar Node and its investigators have led or co-led five CTN protocols, served as a research site for seven CTN studies, co- chaired the CTN Steering Committee and the Data Science Work Group, served on the Research Development Committee, and contributed to several special interest groups. The NorthStar Node's research portfolio includes traditional randomized controlled trials (CTN-0068), pragmatic comparative effectiveness research (CTN-0098A and CTN-0099), implementation science (CTN-0074, CTN-0098B, and CTN-0099), community-based participatory research (CTN-0096), data science (CTN-0076 and CTN-0087), and health services research (CTN-0070). In this application, the NorthStar Node has seven guiding objectives (POLARIS): 1) generating evidence that informs Policy and clinical guidelines; 2) evaluating models addressing co-Occurring SUD and medical and psychiatric conditions; 3) using principals of a Learning health system to conduct pragmatic trials; 4) using Artificial intelligence and other data sciences approaches to enhance SUD research and care; 5) Reaching understudied populations to ensure SUD research is relevant to diverse populations; 6) using Implementation science to test the integration of evidence-based SUD practices into general medical settings; and 7) testing innovative Strategies for SUD treatment. Potential studies to meet these objectives include 1) a novel therapeutic intervention for methamphetamine use disorder; 2) development of machine learning algorithms in the electronic health record to target substance use screening and enhance substance use disorder diagnoses; 3) precision/personalized medicine studies using population pharmacokinetics to better define and refine medication dosing strategies that improve treatment outcome; and 4) testing collaborative care models to address co-occurring chronic medical illnesses in specialty addiction treatment settings. Our expertise spans multi-site clinical trials, implementation science, community-based participatory research, EHR-based interventions, machine learning and natural language processing, and health services research.

"Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer Abstract FreeSurfer is a tool for the analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that has proven to be a flexible and powerful technology for quantifying the effects of many conditions, including numerous neurological disorders, on human brain anatomy, connectivity, vasculature, chemical composition, physiology and function. In the past 20 years, these open source tools have been developed to accurately and automatically segment an array of brain structures and have become the core analysis infrastructure for the Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative (ADNI). In this project, we seek the resources to radically increase the speed, accuracy and flexibility of these tools, taking advantage of exciting new results in Deep Learning. This will enable us to more accurately quantify neuroanatomical changes that are critical to diagnosing, staging and assessing the efficacy of potential therapeutic interventions in diseases such as Alzheimer’s. This includes the generation of documentation, tutorials, unit tests, regression tests and system tests to harden the tools and make them usable by clinicians and neuroscientists, and finally the distribution and support of the data, manual labelings and tools to the more than 40,000 researchers that use FreeSurfer through our existing open source mechanism. In addition, we will analyze the entire Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative dataset and return it for public release, including a set of manually labeled data that can be used to optimize Deep Learning tools for Alzheimer’s Disease over the next decade. Relevance Successful completion of the proposed project will increase the usability and accuracy of our publicly available segmentation tools, and open up new possibilities, such as integrating them into the MRI scanner and rapidly detecting Alzheimer’s-related changes. These new capabilities well enable other studies to significantly increase their ability to detect AD and other disease effects in research settings as well as phase II and phase III clinical trials due to the radical increase in speed of the new tools, enabling them to be applied to a diverse set of MRI contrasts and much larger datasets, rapidly and accurately. Further, they will allow rapid application of cutting-edge analyses to the ongoing Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative dataset, improving the ability to extract early biomarkers of this devastating disease.",Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer,9970009,R01AG064027,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Licensing', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'early detection biomarkers', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'skills', 'spatial relationship', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability', 'web site', 'wiki']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,649026,-0.08019880284685503
"Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  The rate of substance use-related hospital visits in the US continues to increase, and now outpaces visits for heart disease and respiratory failure. The prevalence of substance misuse (nonmedical use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines, illicit drugs, and/or alcohol) in hospitalized patients is estimated to be 15%-25% and far exceeds the prevalence in the general population. With over 35 million hospitalized patients per year, tens of millions of patients are not screened for substance misuse during their stay. Despite the recommendation for self-report questionnaires (single-question universal screens, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT], Drug Abuse Screening Tool [DAST]), screening rates remains low in hospitals. Current screening methods are resource-intensive, so a comprehensive and automated approach to substance misuse screening that will augment current clinical workflow would therefore be of great utility.  In the advent of Meaningful Use in the electronic health record (EHR), efficiency for substance misuse detection may be improved by leveraging data collected during usual care. Documentation of substance use is common and occurs in 97% of provider admission notes, but their free text format renders them difficult to mine and analyze. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning are subfields of artificial intelligence (AI) that provide a solution to analyze text data in the EHR to identify substance misuse. Modern NLP has fused with machine learning, another sub-field of AI focused on learning from data. In particular, the most powerful NLP methods rely on supervised learning, a type of machine learning that takes advantage of current reference standards to make predictions about unseen cases  In our earlier version of an NLP and machine learning tool, our opioid and alcohol misuse classifiers successfully used data from clinical notes collected in the first 24 hours of hospital admission to reach a sensitivity and specificity above 75% for detecting alcohol or opioid misuse. We will improve the performance of our baseline, individual NLP single-substance classifiers for alcohol and opioid misuse by implementing multi-label and multi-task machine learning methods. These methods will take advantage of information shared across different types of substance misuse and better capture the state of a patient within a single model. The resulting classifier will be capable of jointly inferring all types of substance misuse (alcohol misuse, opioid misuse, and non-opioid illicit misuse) including polysubstance use, and cater to each individual patient’s substance use treatment needs.  We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over 35,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. The top performing classifier will then be tested prospectively to: (1) externally validate its screening performance in a hospital without established screening; and (2) test its effectiveness against usual care at a hospital with questionnaire-based substance misuse screening. We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal screening in hospitalized patients and guiding interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE We anticipate that the research proposed will provide novel and critically important tools in artificial intelligence for the detection of substance misuse from the electronic health record (EHR). Development and validation of the substance misuse classifier would enable a standardized approach to perform screening on all patient encounters on a daily basis in health systems. We will rigorously develop and test substance misuse classifier retrospectively and then examine its performance prospectively in both a naïve and mature screening program. This will serve as the first step towards a comprehensive universal screener that leverages available data in the EHR.",Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients,10026785,R01DA051464,"['Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Felis catus', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Care Sector', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intake', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Interviewer', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Social Work', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Substance Abuse Detection', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'comparison intervention', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interoperability', 'machine learning method', 'multitask', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'routine care', 'screening', 'screening program', 'substance misuse', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'trend', 'unstructured data']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,663889,-0.04018634730857132
"PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository The confluence of new machine learning (ML) data-driven approaches; increased computational power; and access to the wealth of electronic health records (EHRs) and other emergent types of data (e.g., omics, imaging, mHealth) are accelerating the development of biomedical predictive models. Such models range from traditional statistical approaches (e.g., regression) through to more advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., convolutional neural networks, CNNs), and span different tasks (e.g., biomarker/pathway discovery, diagnostic, prognostic). Two issues have become evident: 1) as there are no comprehensive standards to support the dissemination of these models, scientific reproducibility is problematic, given challenges in interpretation and implementation; and 2) as new models are put forth, methods to assess differences in performance, as well as insights into external validity (i.e., transportability), are necessary. Tools moving beyond the sharing of data and model “executables” are needed, capturing the (meta)data necessary to fully reproduce a model and its evaluation. The objective of this R01 is the development of an informatics standard supporting the requisite information for scientific reproducibility for statistical and ML-based biomedical predictive models; from this foundation, we then develop new computational approaches to compare models' performance. We begin by extending the current Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard to fully characterize biomedical datasets and harmonize variable definitions; to elucidate the algorithms involved in model creation (e.g., data preprocessing, parameter estimation); and to explain the validation methodology. Importantly, models in this PMML format will become findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (i.e., following FAIR principles). We then propose novel meth- ods to compare and contrast predictive models, assessing transportability across datasets. While metrics exist for comparing models (e.g., c-statistics, calibration), often the required case-level information is not available to calculate these measures. We thus introduce an approach to simulate cases based on a model's reported da- taset statistics, enabling such calculations. Different levels of transportability are then assigned to the metrics, determining the extent to which a selected model is applicable to a given population/cohort (i.e., helping answer the question, can I use this published model with my own data?). We tie these efforts together in our proposed framework, the PREdictive Model Index & Exchange REpository (PREMIERE). We will develop an online portal and repository for model sharing around PREMIERE, and our efforts will include fostering a community of users to guide its development through workshops, model-thons, and other activities. To demonstrate these efforts, we will bootstrap PREMIERE with predictive models from a targeted domain (risk assessment in imaging-based lung cancer screening). Our efforts to evaluate these developments will engage a range of stakeholders (model developers, users) to inform the completeness of our standard; and biostatisticians and clinical experts to guide assessment of model transportability. PROGRAM NARRATIVE With growing access to information contained in the electronic health record and other data sources, the appli- cation of statistical and machine learning methods are generating more biomedical predictive models. However, there are significant challenges to reproducing these models for purposes of comparison and application in new environments/populations. This project develops informatics standards to facilitate the sharing and reproducibil- ity of these models, enabling a suite of comparative methods to evaluate model transportability.",PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository,10016297,R01EB027650,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FAIR principles', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Language', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproduction', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomarker discovery', 'case-based', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'comparative', 'computer aided detection', 'convolutional neural network', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'learning network', 'lung basal segment', 'lung cancer screening', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'software repository', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,673491,-0.00784407108512273
"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9739345,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'statistical learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,687210,-0.003779022733642808
"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers.

"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology.

"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support students’ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",9970958,R44GM133245,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Gametogenesis', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Spinal Cord', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'egg', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'reading ability', 'resource guides', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2020,750000,0.0161892967181315
"Mobilize Center: Models for Mobile Sensing and Precision Rehabilitation Limited mobility due to conditions like osteoarthritis (OA), cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s disease affects millions of individuals, at enormous personal and societal cost. Rehabilitation can dramatically improve mobility and function, but current rehabilitation practice requires in-person guidance by a skilled clinician, increasing expense and limiting access. Mobile sensing technologies are now ubiquitous and have the potential to measure patient function and guide treatment outside the clinic, but they currently fail to capture the characteristics of motion required to accurately monitor function and customize treatment. Millions of low-cost mobile sensors are generating terabytes of data that could be analyzed in combination with other data, such as images, clinical records, and video, to enable studies of unprecedented scale, but machine learning models for analyzing these large-scale, heterogeneous, time-varying data are lacking.  To address these challenges, we will establish a Biomedical Technology Resource Center —The Mobilize Center. Through the leadership of an experienced scientific team, we will create and disseminate innovative tools to quantify movement biomechanics with mobile sensors.  Specifically, we will:  1. Push the bounds of what we can measure via wearable sensors using models that compute muscle  and joint forces and metabolic cost of locomotion. These models, based on biomechanical and machine  learning models, will be disseminated via our newly created OpenSense software, which will be used  by thousands of researchers to gain new insights into patient biomechanics using mobile sensors.  2. Meet the need for tools that analyze data about movement dynamics and develop machine learning  models to analyze and generate insights from unstructured, high-dimensional data, including time-  series (e.g., from mobile sensors), images (e.g., MRI), and video (e.g., smartphone video of a patient’s gait).  3. Provide tools needed to intervene in the real-world. We will develop algorithms to accurately quantify  kinematics outside the lab for long durations using data from inertial measurement units (IMUs). We will  also build behavioral models to adapt and personalize goal setting, drawing on movement records from  6 million individuals, as well as health goals and exercise for 1.7 million people.  Through intensive interactions with our Collaborative Projects, we will focus on improving rehabilitation outcomes for individuals with limited mobility due to osteoarthritis, obesity, Parkinson’s disease, and cerebral palsy. The Center’s tools and services will enable researchers to revolutionize how we diagnose, monitor, and treat mobility disorders, providing tools needed to deliver precision rehabilitation at low cost and on a massive scale in the future.

"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,9863048,R01HL149948,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Device Safety', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'surveillance study', 'systems research', 'tool']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,828534,0.0005707617055850232
"Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The purpose of this proposal is to develop two strategies, natural language processing (NLP) and automated speech analysis (ASA), to enable automated identification of patients with cognitive impairment (CI), from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) in clinical settings. The number of older adults in the United States with MCI and ADRD is increasing and yet the ability of clinicians and researchers to identify them at scale has advanced little over recent decades and screening with clinical assessments is done inconsistently. Alternative strategies using available data, like analysis of diagnostic codes in the clinical record or insurance claims, have very low sensitivity. NLP and ASA used with machine learning are technologies that could greatly increase ability to detect MCI and ADRD in clinical contexts. NLP automatically converts text in the electronic health record (EHR) into structured concepts suitable for analysis. Thus, clinicians’ documentation of signs and symptoms or orders of tests and services that reflect or address cognitive limitations can be efficiently captured, possibly long before the clinician uses an ADRD-related diagnostic code. ASA directly measures cognition by recognizing different features of cognition captured in speech. Extracting features through both NLP and ASA could thus provide a unique measure of cognition and its impact on the individual and their caregivers. Early detection of MCI and ADRD can help researchers identify appropriate patients for research and help clinicians and health systems target patients for preventive care and care coordination. For these reasons, more efficient, highly scalable strategies are needed to identify people with MCI and ADRD. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to (1) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from the EHR with NLP to identify patients with CI, (2) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from ASA of audio recordings of patient-provider encounters during routine primary care visits to identify patients with CI, (3) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using both NLP and ASA extracted features to create an integrated CI diagnostic algorithm. We will develop machine learning algorithms using NLP and ASA extracted features trained against neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validate them in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. In secondary analyses we will train ML algorithms to identify MCI and its subtypes. This project will be the most rigorous development of NLP, ASA, and ML algorithms for CI yet performed, the first to test ASA in primary care settings, and the first to test NLP and ASA feature extraction strategies in combination. The multi-disciplinary team of clinicians, health services researchers, and neurocognitive and data scientists will apply machine learning to develop these highly scalable, automated technologies for identification of MCI and ADRD. 1 Project Narrative The ability of clinicians, health systems and researchers to identify patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) is limited. This project will apply machine learning to natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health record data and automated speech analysis (ASA) of patient-doctor conversations during primary care visits to identify patients with MCI and ADRD using automated and scalable procedures. The analytic algorithms will be developed with neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validated in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. 1",Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment,9998610,R01AG066471,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'New York City', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'adverse event risk', 'aging population', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'care coordination', 'clinical encounter', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'falls', 'feature extraction', 'financial incentive', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental state', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'screening', 'secondary analysis', 'structured data', 'success', 'testing services', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'unstructured data']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,855710,-0.0561307685432473
"An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis Project Summary  Improved methods for the bedside diagnosis and evaluation of neuromuscular disorders are needed. One technology that is finding increasing use for this purpose is electrical impedance myography (EIM). In EIM, a very weak, high frequency electrical current is passed through a muscle of interest and the resulting surface voltages are measured. Disease associated alterations in the composition and microstructural features of the muscle produce characteristic changes that can be used to help classify specific conditions and grade disease severity. To date, most studies using EIM analysis have utilized a fairly limited data set for disease assessment. While effective, this approach ignores a great deal of information locked within the impedance data, including those values that can assist in predicting specific muscle features (such as myofiber diameter) and the presence of pathological change (e.g., fat or connective tissue deposition). In addition, as it stands, the data set is challenging for the clinician to understand without a detailed knowledge of impedance theory. Myolex, Inc is a small business concern located in Boston, MA has as its main focus the development of EIM technologies for clinical use. Myolex recently completed a Phase 1 SBIR that demonstrated the potential capability of machine learning based classification algorithms to effectively discriminate healthy muscle from diseased and to discriminate one disease from another. In this proposed work, we will greatly advance this concept by embodying classification algorithms into a powerful new software suite for Myolex’s current EIM system, the mView. Our underlying hypothesis is that EIM data analysis can be automated to the point that classification systems can provide data on disease diagnosis as well as disease severity for improved ease-of-use. We propose to study this hypothesis via 2 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will design a software suite capable of assisting with artifact-free data collection to be incorporated into our current EIM system, the mViewTM. Then using classification paradigms based on a prodigious amount of previous collected data, we will develop an automated data analysis tool to help provide data on disease category as well as microscopic features, muscle based on the impedance data alone using Microsoft’s Azure Cloud platform. In Specific Aim 2, we will test this developed software suite in a total of180 adult and pediatric neuromuscular disease patients and healthy participants evaluated at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (adults) and Boston Children’s Hospital (children). During this data collection period, the Ohio State and Boston Children’s researchers will have real- time access to Myolex staff to provide feedback and have questions/problems answered and addressed. The user interface will continue to be refined and classification algorithms improved. At the conclusion of this work, a new diagnostic tool will be developed for potential 510(k) FDA approval. It will serve as the basis for a continuously self-refining system as additional data sets are collected by end-users employing them in regular clinical use. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a valuable technique to assist with the evaluation of a variety of conditions affecting nerve and muscle. However, to date, only simplistic EIM outcomes have been utilized to assess muscle condition. In this proposed work, we will develop a software platform using machine learning to be incorporated into current EIM technology to allow for automated diseased classification and characterization using the entire large EIM data set collected with each muscle measurement. This will serve as the basis for a new, powerful and convenient tool for neuromuscular diagnosis that will continue to advance over time.",An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis,10002324,R44NS113756,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Technology', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Nerve', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercialization', 'complex data ', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'feature extraction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric patients', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'sarcopenia', 'software development', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'voltage']",NINDS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R44,2020,869698,0.00375785951469254
"Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope Abstract This SBIR Phase II project will develop a deep learning-based clinical decision support algorithm for detecting and diagnosing valvular heart disease based on heart sounds recorded using the Eko Core and Eko Duo Digital Stethoscopes. This screening tool will help to decrease the number of patients with valvular heart disease that remain undertreated simply because their condition is not diagnosed. Auscultation is commonly the method by which valvular heart disease is first detected, but cases often fail to be referred to echocardiography for diagnosis because clinicians fail to detect heart murmurs, particularly in noisy or rushed environments. To address this challenge, Eko had developed the Core, a digital stethoscope attachment that can be added in-line to a clinician’s existing stethoscope that amplifies heart sounds and Duo, a digital stethoscope in a handheld form factor with built-in single lead electrocardiogram. Both devices are designed to stream digitized phonocardiograms to a smartphone, tablet or personal computer. There, the signal can be analyzed with the decision support algorithm we will develop as part of this project. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to collect a database with condition- specific recording labels to enable deep learning for heart sounds though clinical data collection at six clinical sites, and (2) to develop and evaluate a collection of deep convolutional neural network-based algorithms trained on the database. These algorithms will (2a) distinguish between systolic, diastolic and continuous murmurs, (2b) classify aortic stenosis (AS), mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and innocent murmurs (2c) assess the severity of AS, MR and TR. By integrating these deep learning algorithms into Eko's mobile and cloud software platform, currently used by clinicians at over 1000 institutions worldwide, we anticipate this algorithm will enable more accurate screening for valvular heart disease in adult patients, leading to earlier diagnosis and better patient outcomes. Public Health Relevance Valvular heart disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent manifestation of poor cardiovascular health in both the developed and developing world. A highly-accurate clinical decision support algorithm that is able to detect and classify valvular heart disease will impact public health by reducing unnecessary referrals for echocardiography and promoting early and accurate diagnosis in underserved areas with limited access to specialty care.",Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope,10079904,R44HL144297,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Auscultation', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Eko', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart murmur', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm training', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'clinically significant', 'cloud software', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sound']",NHLBI,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R44,2020,938347,-0.0034667306562383
"West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification Project Summary – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) is committed to the overall goals of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Initiative and specifically aims to largely improve small molecule identifications. Understanding metabolism is important to gain insight into biochemical processes and relevant to battle diseases such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. Compound identification in metabolomics is still a daunting task with many unknown compounds and false positive identifications. The major goal of the WCMC is therefore to develop processes and resources that accelerate and improve the accuracy of the compound identification workflow for experts and medical professionals. The WCMC for Compound Identification is structured in three different entities: the Administrative Core, the Computational Core and the Experimental Core. The Center is led by the Director Prof. Fiehn in close collaboration with quantum chemistry experts Prof. Wang and Prof. Tantillo, and metabolomics experts Dr. Barupal and Dr. Kind with broad support from mass spectrometry, computational metabolomics and programming experts. The Administrative Core will assist the Computational and Experimental Core to develop and validate large in-silico mass spectral libraries, retention time prediction models and innovative methods for constraining and ranking lists of isomers in an integrated process of cheminformatics tools and databases. The developed tools and databases will be made available to all Common Fund Metabolomics Consortium (CF-MC) members and professional working groups. The WCMC will also provide guidance for compound identification to the National Metabolomics Data Repository. The broad dissemination of developed compound identification protocols, training for compound identification workflows, databases and distribution of internal reference standard kits for metabolomic standardization will overall widely support the metabolomics community. Project Narrative – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) Understanding metabolism is relevant to find both markers and mechanisms of diseases and health phenotypes, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer.

"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices. Project Narrative The proposed activities of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for substance use disorders (SUD). These activities reflect a vision for the next iteration of the CTN in the next 5 years. This work will advance translational science in SUD research and markedly reduce the gap between SUD research and clinical practice -- with a focus on scaling-up and sustaining best practices.",Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network,10056244,UG1DA040309,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Community Networks', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Drug abuse', 'Experimental Designs', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Fire - disasters', 'Funding', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Maine', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'National Clinical Trials Network', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New Hampshire', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Science', 'Security', 'Series', 'Strategic Planning', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vermont', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'chronic pain', 'clinical practice', 'cocaine use', 'college', 'community organizations', 'comorbidity', 'data privacy', 'design', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care settings', 'health data', 'high risk population', 'high school', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'marijuana use', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'personalized health care', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'randomized trial', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'research study', 'rural setting', 'scale up', 'screening', 'smart watch', 'social media', 'special interest group', 'telehealth', 'treatment disparity', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,UG1,2020,1022375,-0.012013243826948006
"Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt Founded in 1965 as one of the original Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Research Centers (IDDRC), the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC serves as the central nexus across Vanderbilt for interdisciplinary research, communication, and training in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The VKC IDDRC serves as a trans-institutional institute that brings together over 200 faculty from 38 departments in 10 schools at Vanderbilt. The VKC’s mission to facilitate discoveries that inform best practices to improve the lives of people with IDD and their families. This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions across the VKC’s federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a “Center culture” wherein research and discovery permeates the VKC’s broader training and service activities, thus enhancing the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator- authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20). Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high- impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRC’s work. Aim 1 provides core services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes, mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3) incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70 research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHD’s vision of applying newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a group, intellectual and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, have dramatic effects on affected people’s and their caregiver’s lives. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of understanding about what causes these disabilities and, critically, how to treat them with targeted therapies. The Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center serves as the hub for Vanderbilt’s research efforts focusing on improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by understanding the causes of these disorders and developing and testing therapies tailored to each individual’s precise needs.",Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt,10085550,P50HD103537,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Affect', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Down Syndrome', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Research', 'Prevention', 'Problem behavior', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinical translation', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug-induced weight gain', 'experience', 'image processing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'translational neuroscience', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P50,2020,1387605,-0.015481834636364404
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined.

"Eavesdropping on heart-brain conversations during sleep for early detection and prevention of fatal cardiovascular disease ABSTRACT  The intimate link between the heart, brain and sleep is central to our well-being and ability to meet the demands of life. A majority of cardiovascular (CV) deaths occur in the early waking hours from sleep. For example, sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), an extremely prevalent and devastating condition, claims more lives (>350,000/year) in the USA than all disease-related causes of death combined. A defibrillator can prevent SCA, but current clinical strategies are grossly inadequate, both in terms of identifying people at risk and importantly, monitoring and controlling the CV risk. To address this major gap, we are proposing an entirely novel approach for studying heart-brain interactions during sleep. To our knowledge, our compelling new preliminary data and innovative strategy are unprecedented.  In robust preliminary studies of animals and humans, we have identified unique signatures of evolving, potentially fatal, CV disease within electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms that otherwise cannot be detected by current clinical methods and conventional statistics. Our powerful new tools reveal these “hidden” signatures during sleep (i.e., as conscious activity decreases and autonomic control of the heart becomes prominent). This missing link we have identified between the heart, brain, spontaneous intrinsic arousals, and critical CV disease is independent (in multivariate analyses) of sleep disordered breathing (e.g., apnea) and established risk factors. Our novel and highly promising findings may account for the high incidence of CV deaths associated with sleep and have potential for broad application, ranging from animal models to improved reclassification of individuals currently consid- ered “low”, “moderate” or “high” risk in contemporary clinical practice. This is important because asymptomatic individ- uals without advanced CV disease comprise the majority of SCA victims. They also are the ones “missed” by current risk stratification methods and the most challenging to identify. Further, our fundamental new approach to EEG and ECG analysis will add new, clinically valuable, prognostic insight for patients with advanced CV disease (e.g., heart failure). This robust, inexpensive, personalized strategy for identifying who will and will not need lifesaving therapy will also avoid unnecessary procedures and complications, and thus, will provide substantial socioeconomic benefits.  This paradigm-shifting application for a NIH Director’s New Innovator Award incorporates clinical cardiac electro- physiology, critical care and sleep medicine with engineering, mathematics, artificial intelligence, statistical dynamical systems, and molecular, cellular and clinical research to enable early diagnosis and therapy of critical CV disease. Our unique approach for gaining novel mechanistic insight into CV pathology and risk during sleep is likely to spawn new avenues in collaborative multidisciplinary research. Because our new paradigm can be seamlessly incorporated into existing technology readily available in hospitals and clinics, we expect our findings to rapidly transform contem- porary clinical practice in multiple fields. Importantly, the ability to identify and decode “hidden” EEG and ECG signa- tures of early onset of fatal, subclinical CV illness, including SCA, the leading cause of death in the industrialized world, has extraordinary implications for human health and the potential for broad worldwide application. NARRATIVE  The treatment of heart disease after clinical presentation has limited success. Irreversible organ system damage often initiates by the time the patient presents clinically. We seek to introduce, understand and validate a completely new approach for analyzing heart and brain signals to reveal information about evolving critical disease in an individual that otherwise would remain undetected by current clinical methods until catastrophic clinical presentation. If validated, this new paradigm will have extraordinary implications for human health and the potential to open new avenues in research and therapy.",Eavesdropping on heart-brain conversations during sleep for early detection and prevention of fatal cardiovascular disease,10002962,DP2HL157941,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Apnea', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Pathology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Conscious', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Defibrillators', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'body system', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'dynamic system', 'early onset', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized strategies', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,DP2,2020,2407500,-0.0006366343567540118
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined.

"Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine Project Summary Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice. NARRATIVE Clinical trials are a critical step in translating discoveries into better treatments for people burdened by cardiac disorders. Such trials typically require cooperation and coordination among a broad range of investigators, patients, government agencies, and industry partners. The objective of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical research through shared infrastructure for important trials that will advance therapy for patients suffering from cardiac disease.",Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine,9914111,U01HL088942,"['Address', 'Administrative Coordination', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Ancillary Study', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Management Resources', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Secure', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical center', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'electronic data', 'electronic data capture system', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'international center', 'large datasets', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'performance site', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research data dissemination', 'screening', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable sensor technology']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2020,7231781,0.004406298891781224
"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research. The conference brings together national experts on a host of topics ranging from bioethics to bioinformatics to biomedical informatics to speak and lead workshops on timely challenges posed in translating complex genomic and health data into clinical practice. The conference series also serves to promote diversity in the biomedical workforce.

"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia.

"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,9673231,K99NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2019,90185,0.002259862034992947
"Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records ABSTRACT: There are nearly 7,000 diseases that have a prevalence of only one in 2,000 individuals or less. Yet, such rare diseases are estimated to collectively affect over 300 million people worldwide, representing a significant healthcare concern. Although rare diseases have predominantly genetic origins, nearly half of them do not manifest symptoms until adulthood and frequently confound discovery and diagnosis. Even in the case of early onset disorders, the sheer number of possible diagnoses can often overwhelm clinicians. As a result, rare diseases are often diagnosed with delay, misdiagnosed or even remain undiagnosed, not only disrupting patient lives but also hindering progress on our understanding of such diseases. Data science methods that mine large-scale retrospective health record data for phenotypic information will aid in timely and accurate diagnoses of rare diseases, especially when combined with additional data types, thus, having significant real- world impact. This proposal will integrate electronic health record (EHR) data sets with publicly available vocabularies and ontologies, and genomic data for the improved identification and characterization of patients with rare diseases, using approaches from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and basic bioinformatics. The work has three specific aims and will be carried out in two phases. During the mentored phase, the principal investigator (PI) will develop data-driven methods to extract standardized concepts related to rare diseases from clinical notes and infer the occurrence of each disease (Aim 1). He will also develop data science approaches to compare and contrast longitudinal patterns associated with patients' journeys through the healthcare system when seeking a diagnosis for a rare disease, and aid in clinical decision-making by leveraging these patterns (Aim 2). During the independent phase (Aim 3), computational methods will be developed for the integrated modeling and analysis of genotypic (from Aim 3) and phenotypic information (from Aims 1 and 2). Cohorts to be sequenced will cover diseases for which causal genes or disease definitions are unclear (discovery), as well as those for which these are well known (validation). This work will be carried out under the mentorship of four faculty members with complementary expertise in biomedical informatics, data science, NLP, and rare disease genomics at the University of Washington, the largest medical system in the Pacific Northwest (four million EHRs), world-renowned researchers in medical genetics, and a robust data science environment. In addition, under the direction of the mentoring team, the PI will complete advanced coursework, receive training in translational bioinformatics and clinical research informatics, submit manuscripts, and seek an independent research position. This proposal will yield preliminary results for subsequent studies on data-driven phenotyping and enable the realization of the PI's career goals by providing him with the necessary training to build on his machine learning and basic bioinformatics expertise to transition into an independent investigator in biomedical data science. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare genetic diseases are estimated to affect the lives of 25 to 30 million Americans and their families, and present a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Currently, our knowledge of the broad spectrum of the 7,000 observed rare diseases is limited to a few well-studied ones, hindering our ability to make correct and timely diagnoses. The objective of this study is to improve the identification of patients with rare diseases in healthcare systems by developing data science approaches that automatically recognize rare disease-related patterns in patient health records and correlate them with genomic data, thus, aiding in diagnosis and discovery.",Integrative data science approaches for rare disease discovery in health records,9645433,K99LM012992,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Washington', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'causal variant', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease phenotype', 'early onset disorder', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'member', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'rare condition', 'rare genetic disorder', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,92070,-0.01343462897466498
"Real-time Non-Rigid 3D Reconstruction and Registration for Laparoscopic-guided Minimally Invasive Liver Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Liver deformation leads to difficulties in tumor localization during minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS). The goal of this proposal is to develop an efficient surgical navigation tool for MILS by compensating for liver deformation and mapping preoperative data to the patient’s anatomy. Specifically, we will develop a non-rigid simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) approach to estimate the deformation of liver surface from stereo laparoscopy videos. We will develop machine-learning methods to detect landmarks and perform non- rigid registration. The algorithms will be implemented on a GPU to achieve real-time. Preliminary data has demonstrated the feasibility. During the R00 phase, we will mainly address the clinical needs and develop novel ways to provide intraoperative guidance. This project will greatly improve the tumor resection accuracy in MILS. The candidate for this award Dr. Haoyin Zhou is a postdoc at Surgical Planning Laboratory (SPL), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). Dr. Zhou has extensive experience and expertise in computer vision, machine learning and their applications in medicine. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. National Center for Image Guided Therapy, and Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided Operating (AMIGO) suite will greatly support this research. Dr. Zhou’s long-term research goal is to develop and apply advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of medical image processing and image-guided therapy. To achieve these goals, Dr. Zhou plans to receive more education and training in the following four areas: (1) Critical training in conducting translational research in the hospital environment with surgeons and radiologists, (2) knowledge in the development of technologies for surgical guidance, (3) training in machine learning and its applications in medicine, and (4) training on writing grant applications independently and seeking funding. Dr. Zhou will participate in formal courses selected from Harvard, Harvard Catalyst, MIT CSAIL and Stanford Courses. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH, HMS and MIT.

"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples and directly translating this ‘omics data into useful biological inference. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples on which we will develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation of free-text sample-level metadata.

"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9663961,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,127308,-0.003149710853832814
"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied.

"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements (DS) and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); our ability to readily identify interactions between DS with prescription medications is currently very limited. To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored. Our long-term goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate its findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support systems. The objective of this application is to develop an informatics framework to enable the discovery of DSIs by creating a DS terminology and mining scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. Towards these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Compile a comprehensive DS terminology using online resources; and (2) Discover potential DSIs from the biomedical literature. The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel informatics paradigm and resources for identifying most clinically significant DSI signals and their biological mechanisms. This information is critical to subsequent efforts aimed at improving patient safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The results from this study are imperative in order to achieve the ultimate goal of reducing an individual’s risk of potential DSIs. n/a",An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions,9882672,R01AT009457,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Failure', 'Food', 'Ginkgo biloba', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Herbal supplement', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Products', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Postoperative Hemorrhage', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Targeted Research', 'Terminology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'drug testing', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'screening', 'tool']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,149810,-0.008479295070637126
"Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes ABSTRACT Patterns (e.g. frequency, amount, etc.) of dietary intake and daily physical activity have each been independently linked with an increasing prevalence of obesity. Yet, connecting these patterns to obesity and chronic disease through the integration of time has not been previously considered. Given the strong evidence for independent linkages between each of these patterns and obesity, there is a critical need to determine the potential synergistic correlation of these patterns of behavior within the framework of a relationship with health. In the absence of such insights, opportunities for early detection of behavioral patterns that predispose obesity and chronic disease will be missed, and our long-term research goal to create these early detection strategies will not be met. The central hypothesis of this project is based on the analytical framework and methodology that was previously developed by the investigators: that daily patterns of energy intake, when integrated with physical activity, will be associated with health in a representative sample of U.S. adults 20 to 65 y (NHANES 2003-2006). The objectives in this R21 application include the development of data patterning methodology that can be used to create distinct dietary intake and physical activity patterns and then successfully integrate these patterns to identify population temporal pattern clusters. Next, the investigators will evaluate the cluster relationships with obesity and health outcomes and compare the integrated clusters to the un-integrated dietary and activity pattern clusters. The working hypotheses are firstly, that novel distance measures based on dynamic time warping for the dietary and physical activity data can be integrated to produce meaningful clustering related to health, and secondly, that a population cluster which exhibits a pattern of evenly spaced eating occasions, moderate energy consumption and moderate physical activity patterns in a 24 hour day will be associated with normal weight and without chronic disease, and that relationships with health outcomes will be stronger for the integrated temporal pattern clusters compared with un-integrated temporal dietary clusters and physical activity clusters. The rationale for this research is that its successful completion is expected to create data reduction methods that classify temporal lifestyle patterns linked to disease, further, the expectation is that these analytical techniques will integrate multidimensional temporal dietary and physical activity data. These outcomes are expected to have a significant positive impact, not only in developing/evaluating new analytic methods but in laying the groundwork for data based preventative interventions. This proposed research is potentially significant because results will provide a starting point for understanding the importance of the timing of dietary and physical activity patterns to the prevention of obesity and disease with potentially broad translational  RELEVANCE TO NIH The proposed research is relevant to public health because preventative time-based dietary and physical activity patterns will be identified among the US population, which are expected to open new research horizons for evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because individualized early detection of lifestyles supporting health or linked with disease may be attainable through the development of analytical techniques integrating multiple layers of data. Such strategies could be applied to utilize the increasing information from personal electronic monitoring devices and to detect patterns associated with positive and negative health outcomes.",Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes,9702773,R21CA224764,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic Disease', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Energy Intake', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moderate Exercise', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data reduction', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'expectation', 'health data', 'healthy lifestyle', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'modifiable behavior', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'prevent', 'speech processing', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'waist circumference']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,156798,-0.003734251348853303
"Detecting Middle Ear Fluid Using Smartphones PROJECT SUMMARY Otitis media is one of the most common childhood diseases in developing countries; many of its complications are preventable if middle ear fluid is detected early. We propose an accessible and accurate smartphone-based screening tool that (i) sends a soft acoustic chirp into the ear canal using the smartphone speaker, (ii) detects reflected sound from the eardrum using the smartphone microphone, and (iii) employs a machine learning model to classify these reflections and predict middle ear fluid status in realtime. Given the ubiquity of smartphones and the inaccuracy of visual otoscopy, the system we propose has the potential to be the default screening tool used in developing countries by healthcare providers and caregivers at home. PROJECT NARRATIVE Otitis media is one of the most common childhood diseases in developing countries affecting over 1.23 billion people in 2013 and can lead to complications such as hearing loss, developmental delay, meningitis, mastoiditis, and death. Many of these complications are preventable if middle ear fluid is detected early. However, the absence of an accurate and accessible method to detect middle ear fluid has led to high misdiagnosis rates. The consequence is associated hearing and speech impairment rates greater than any other pediatric condition and growing microbial resistance as a result of antibiotic over-prescription. Currently, the technique of choice for detecting middle ear fluid by primary care providers is visual otoscopy, which has a diagnostic accuracy as low as 51%. Although more accurate methods like tympanometry and pneumatic otoscopy exist, they require significant expertise and referral to a specialist. Commercial acoustic reflectometers and smartphone-mounted otoscopes require specialized hardware. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need for an accurate, rapid and easily accessible method for resource-limited healthcare providers and caregivers to detect middle ear fluid. This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using the speakers and microphones on existing smartphones to detect middle ear fluid by assessing eardrum mobility. Our proposed system would operate by (i) sending a soft acoustic chirp into the ear canal using the smartphone speaker, (ii) detecting reflected sound from the eardrum using the smartphone microphone, and (iii) employing a machine learning model to classify these reflections and predict middle ear fluid status. No additional attachments would be required beyond a paper funnel, which acts as a speculum to reduce waveform variability and can be constructed with printer paper, scissors, and tape. This technique is the first software-based screening tool for middle ear fluid detection that uses off-the-shelf smartphones which does not require hardware attachments or visual interpretation. Using data from our existing preliminary clinical study we aim to develop signal processing and machine learning algorithms to optimize sensitivity and specificity. We plan to develop a bench testing technique that enables previously unsupported smartphones to to run our test and prospectively validate our optimized algorithm clinically in parallel testing with an acoustic reflectometer. Further we aim to develop a user interface and improved funnel design. These new designs will undergo usability testing in physician and parent populations. Given the ubiquity of smartphones, our app has the potential to be the default screening tool used in developing countries by healthcare providers and caregivers at home.",Detecting Middle Ear Fluid Using Smartphones,9906782,R43DC018434,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Earwax', 'Environment', 'External auditory canal', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Galaxy', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hearing', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Industry Standard', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mastoiditis', 'Measures', 'Meningitis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Obstruction', 'Otitis Media', 'Otoscopes', 'Otoscopy', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Speculums', 'Speech', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tympanic membrane', 'Tympanometry', 'Visual', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'microbial', 'microphone', 'middle ear', 'prospective', 'screening', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'urgent care', 'usability']",NIDCD,"WAVELY DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2019,157842,-0.0077523348038065105
"Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease ABSTRACT The purpose of this award is to provide Dr. Elsie Ross, Assistant Professor of Surgery (Vascular Surgery) and Medicine (Biomedical Informatics Research) at Stanford University, the support necessary to transition her from a junior investigator into an independent surgeon-scientist in translational biomedical informatics. Dr. Ross is a vascular surgeon with an advanced degree in health services research and postdoctoral training in biomedical informatics. Her long-term goal is to combine her interdisciplinary training to develop and implement machine learning tools that will enable the delivery of precise, high-value care to patients with cardiovascular diseases. Her career development activities focus on advancing her ability to translate informatics discoveries into viable clinical tools by 1) completing didactic courses to deepen and expand her knowledge of deep learning algorithms, clinical trials and implementation science, 2) designing and conducting her first independent human subjects clinical research study evaluating the performance of machine learning technology, 3) implementing and evaluating the effects of an electronic health record (EHR)-based screening tool to identify latent vascular disease, and 4) strengthening her previous training in cost-effectiveness analysis to enable her future aim of evaluating the associated costs and utility of pro-active, automated disease screening. The candidate has convened a mentorship team that includes Dr. Nigam Shah, a biomedical informatics expert who combines machine learning, text-mining and medical ontologies to enable a learning health care system; Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey a world-expert in cardiovascular clinical trials; and Dr. Paul Heidenreich, an expert in implementation sciences with a focus on the use of EHR interventions to improve care quality for cardiovascular patients and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new technologies. The research proposal builds on the candidate's prior work with using machine learning and EHR data to evaluate and predict cardiovascular disease outcomes. The candidate now proposes to characterize the performance of machine learning algorithms in identifying patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) using EHR data (Aim 1), evaluate whether learned classification models perform better than traditional risk factors for identification of undiagnosed PAD in a prospective patient cohort (Aim 2), and implement an EHR-based screening tool to identify patients with undiagnosed PAD and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment effects (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research will result in a novel, EHR-based screening tool for identification of undiagnosed vascular disease that can decrease PAD-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through earlier and more aggressive medical management. This research will also form the basis for an R01 application before the end of the award to conduct a multi-site randomized-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of EHR- based proactive PAD screening. ! ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripheral artery disease is a prevalent yet under-diagnosed condition that can lead to limb loss, stroke, heart attacks and/or premature death.

"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs.

"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team. Through this career development plan, Dr. Shah will build upon her prior training in clinical cardiology and research methodology and lay a strong foundation for a high impact research career.

"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infants born prematurely experience some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity and are among the most expensive patients in all of pediatrics. Now, with the availability of large sources of healthcare data from insurance claims databases and electronic health records, there is an opportunity to better understand prematurity and its predictors using computational techniques. We propose leveraging state of the art deep learning models built using data from hospitals and insurers to both predict which pregnancies will result in preterm birth and to predict which preterm infants will experience severe cardiac and pulmonary morbidity.",Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning,9928552,K01HL141771,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Accounting', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Boston', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cardiac', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Graduate Degree', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Human Pathology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatology', 'Outcome', 'Patent Ductus Arteriosus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Premature Labor', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'education planning', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'peer', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'social', 'statistics']",NHLBI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2019,166320,0.001559919801361212
"Genomic sequencing to aid diagnosis in pediatric and prenatal practice: Examining clinical utility, ethical implications, payer coverage, and data integration in a diverse population. PROJECT SUMMARY I propose to gain experience in what are becoming the next big topics in genomic medicine – the integration of “big data” using data science in order to achieve “precision health” – what could be summed up as “data science of the future”. These topics emerge from - but go beyond - the narrower concept of “precision medicine” as the use of genetic information for treatment decisions. The goal is to develop experience in data science and precision health so that my work can serve as a bridge between my field of economics and these fields - and begin to prepare for the future challenges as they emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both data science and precision health will be critical components of future health care interventions and impact patients, providers, and society. “Big Data” using data science includes the aggregation and analysis of data across platforms (includes information from, e.g. genetic testing, biosensors, wearables, and electronic health records, with such data analyzed using, e.g. artificial intelligence and machine learning). Precision Health uses a “big data” approach to focus on disease prevention and detection throughout one’s lifetime.","Genomic sequencing to aid diagnosis in pediatric and prenatal practice: Examining clinical utility, ethical implications, payer coverage, and data integration in a diverse population.",9929780,U01HG009599,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biosensor', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Patients', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Precision Health', 'Provider', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Sum', 'Work', 'data integration', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'formal learning', 'genetic information', 'informal learning', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U01,2019,166973,-0.009342468430148618
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,9645854,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2019,169440,0.002003007232997597

"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,9717330,K23AR075070,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calcium Pyrophosphate', 'Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diuretics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Female', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Structure', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vascular calcification', 'Vascularization', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bisphosphonate', 'calcium indicator', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'crystallinity', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'sex', 'side effect', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2019,176541,0.003065839548463128
"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9749154,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,178606,0.02036707161011284
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. In carrying out the research outlined in the following proposal, we plan to develop and apply machine learning methods to better identify subpopulations of individuals who have similar forms of COPD, potentially enabling better, targeted therapies.",Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD,9704042,K25HL130637,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cachexia', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Mass', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Scheme', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career development', 'cigarette smoke', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'flexibility', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'particle', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K25,2019,189000,-0.06120475283458491
"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development award will: a) Lead to the development and validation of a pediatric-specific Environmental Enteropathy (EE) Deep Learning Net for small intestinal structure which is urgently needed to standardize the diagnosis, care, and research of EE worldwide; b) Employ computational methods to correlate Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing morphological EE features with multiomic data to provide comprehensive diagnostic and predictive criteria for EE, and c) Validation of promising circulating biomarkers against intestinal biopsies, the diagnostic gold standard for enteropathies. Successful completion of this work will channel our improved understanding of the gut's critical role in childhood stunting pathways towards effective interventions to improve nutrition and health in at risk populations.",Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy,9666310,K23DK117061,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Asia', 'Bangladeshi', 'Bile Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Celiac Disease', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Duodenum', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gluten', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human Pathology', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lactulose', 'Lamina Propria', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lymphocytosis', 'MS4A1 gene', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Multiomic Data', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Virginia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'enteric pathogen', 'imaging approach', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'intraepithelial', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrition', 'oral vaccine', 'patient oriented', 'socioeconomics', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,K23,2019,194052,-0.012998355421343527
"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"Auto-Scope Software-Automated Otoscopy to Diagnose Ear Pathology ABSTRACT Acute infections of the middle ear (acute otitis media - AOM), are the most commonly treated childhood disease. Treatment is fueled by concern for complications and effects on children's cognitive and language development. The financial burden of AOM is estimated at more than $5 billion per year. Because AOM is so common, a major societal problem is the over-diagnosis and over-treatment of this disease, as a result of two factors: First, accurately diagnosing AOM is difficult, even for experienced primary care or ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physicians. Second, with a growing shortage of primary care physicians in the US, more Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants serve as first-line clinicians in primary care settings, but lack extensive training in otoscopy (i.e. clinical examination of the eardrum). Consequently, practitioners often err on the side of making a diagnosis of AOM and prescribing oral antibiotics. Over 8 million unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed annually, contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and creating the largest number of pediatric medication-related adverse events. Many children with inaccurate diagnoses of AOM are referred to ENTs for surgical placement of ear tubes, and up to 70% of these cases are not indicated. Diagnosing AOM still depends on clinician subjectivity, based on a brief glimpse of the eardrum. This diagnostic subjectivity creates a critical barrier to progress in society's goal of decreasing healthcare costs and reducing over-diagnosis and over-treatment of AOM. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2013, devices are needed to assist in more accurate, consistent, and objective diagnosis of AOM. A simple and objective method of analyzing an image of a patient's ear to diagnose or rule out AOM would drastically reduce over-treatment. This project will fill that gap, by developing computer-assisted image analysis (CAIA) software that provides objective information to a clinician by analyzing eardrum images collected using currently available hardware. Based on previous work in applying similar methods to improve clinician performance in radiology and surgical pathology, our overarching hypothesis is that the incremental implementation of enhanced images, automated identification of abnormalities, and retrieval of similar cases will result in improved clinician diagnostic accuracy. In our preliminary work, we developed software, called Auto-Scope, which labels eardrums as “normal” versus “abnormal.” In this study, we propose two Specific Aims to improve diagnostic performance: Specific Aim #1: Create an enhanced composite image of the eardrum. Specific Aim #2: Use machine learning approaches for clinical decision support. The proposed research is relevant to public health because we are generating new methods aimed at improving diagnostic quality and reducing inter-observer variability, which will ultimately enable more accurate diagnosis and personalized therapeutic approaches for ear abnormalities. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission pertaining to the application of novel strategies that may improve human health, and NIDCD's mission of improving diagnosis and treatment of ear diseases, particularly otitis media.",Auto-Scope Software-Automated Otoscopy to Diagnose Ear Pathology,9790958,R21DC016972,"['Academy', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesteatoma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Cyst', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Ear Diseases', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hair', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nose', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otolaryngologist', 'Otoscopes', 'Otoscopy', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physician Assistants', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Side', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Tympanic membrane', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'acute infection', 'base', 'central database', 'clinical decision support', 'cognitive development', 'computerized', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'digital video recording', 'effusion', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'middle ear', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overtreatment', 'personalized therapeutic', 'primary care setting', 'prototype', 'software development']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,199142,-0.018760057136935192
"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream infections caused by Staph- ylococcus aureus in the Veterans Health Administration.",Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections,9721752,K08DA048163,"['Acute suppurative arthritis due to bacteria', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embolism', 'Endocarditis', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV risk', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C Transmission', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Predisposition', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'blood treatment', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health administration', 'heroin use', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'injection drug use', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid injection', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'prescription opioid', 'responsible research conduct', 'screening', 'skin microbiota', 'time interval', 'treatment services', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2019,203040,-0.008432672751153482

"Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections Abstract COMBiNATi will work with Stanford University to bring the world’s first integrated ID+AST UTI diagnostic platform to the market by combining COMBiNATi’s “one-click” cost-effective dPCR platform with Stanford’s pathogen identification (ID) HRMA algorithm for broad detection, deep characterization and absolute quantification of UTI pathogens. By the end of the Phase 1 project, we will deliver the prototype instrument for ID and AST, scale-ready consumables for dPCR + HRM and culture + qPCR, machine-learning software algorithm for melt curve analysis, and prove the feasibility by identifying and quantifying the top two urinary tract infection bacteria. We will first develop two consumables: an 100k partition ID chip and a 32-lane, 10k partition per lane AST plate based on the micro-injection molding design rules established by COMBiNATi. An integrated system with thermal control and imaging capability will then be developed for HRM and qPCR processes. The prototype system will then be transferred to Stanford University where mock samples including both isolated bacteria and contrived urine samples will be tested on the platform for integrated pathogen ID and AST determination. Narrative Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the most common community-acquired bacterial infection. However, like other bacterial infections, standard culture-based diagnosis of UTI requires at least 2-3 days from sample acquisition to result reporting. Despite technological advancements, the process remains time- consuming and requires significant technical expertise. Automated instruments remain bulky and still require clonal isolation of the pathogens from the body fluid samples prior to AST. Additionally, the lack of definitive microbiological diagnosis that is rapid enough to achieve evidence-based treatment has driven the over- and misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We believe the proposed integrated ID + AST platform has the potential to enable deep genetic analyses of clinical samples to provide rapid precision UTI triage and MIC determination in a timely and cost-efficient manner to positively impact patient care as well as promote the use of narrow spectrum antibiotics to favorably impact antibiotic resistance profiles.",Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections,9777415,R41AI145604,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Ampicillin', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Fluids', 'Ceftriaxone', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Genomic DNA', 'Gentamicins', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microfluidics', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Molecular', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Uropathogen', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'digital', 'genetic analysis', 'imaging capabilities', 'instrument', 'melting', 'microbial', 'operation', 'pathogen', 'prototype', 'response', 'scale up', 'screening', 'success']",NIAID,"COMBINATI, INC.",R41,2019,224658,-0.003948333809483687
"Adaptive & Individualized AAC The heterogeneity of the more than 1.3% of Americans who suffer from severe physical impairments (SPIs) preclude the use of common augmentative or alternative communication (AAC) solutions such as manual signs, gestures or dexterous interaction with a touchscreen for communication. While efforts to develop alternative access methods through eye or head tracking have provided some communication advancements for these individuals, all current technologies suffer from the same fundamental limitation: existing AAC devices require patients to conform to generic communication access methods and interfaces rather than the device conforming to the user. Consequently, AAC users are forced to settle for interventions that require excessive training and cognitive workload only to deliver extremely slow information transfer rates (ITRs) and recurrent communication errors that ultimately deprive them of the fundamental human right of communication. To meet this health need, we propose the first smart-AAC system designed using individually adaptive access methods and AAC interfaces to accommodate the unique manifestations of motor impairments specific to each user. Preliminary research by our team of speech researchers at Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital (Communication Center Lab) and Boston University (STEPP Lab), utilizing wearable sensors developed by our group (Altec, Inc) have already demonstrated that metrics based on surface electromyographic (sEMG) and accelerometer measures of muscle activity and movement for head-mediated control can be combined with optimizable AAC interfaces to improve ITRs when compared with traditional unoptimized AAC devices. Leveraging this pilot work, our team is now proposing a Phase I project to demonstrate the proof-of-concept that a single sEMG/IMU hybrid sensor worn on the forehead can provide improvements in ITR and communication accuracy when integrated with an AAC interface that is optimized through machine learning algorithms. The prototype system will be tested and compared to a conventional (non-adaptable) interface in subjects with SPI at a collaborative clinical site. Assistance by our speech and expert-AAC collaborators will ensure that all phases of technology development are patient-centric and usable in the context of clinical care. In Phase II we will build upon this proof-of-concept to design a smart-AAC system with automated optimization software that achieves dynamic learning which adapts to intra-individual changes in function through disease progression or training as well as inter-individual differences in motor impairments for a diverse set of users with spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, ALS, and other SPIs. The innovation is the first and only AAC technology that combines advancements in wearable-sensor access with interfaces that are autonomously optimized to the user, thereby reducing the resources and training needed to achieve effective person-centric communication in SPI, through improved HMI performance and reduced workload.

"Development of an adaptive machine learning platform for automated analysis of biomarkers in biomedical images ABSTRACT Manual analysis of biomedical images by researchers and pathologists has the potential to introduce bias and error that compromise the reliability of research and clinical findings. These problems are significant barriers to delivering the most beneficial evidence-based medicine, developing effective medical treatments, and promoting confidence in scientific inquiry. Identification of biomarkers and cellular targets following microscopy requires manual analysis of biomedical images, which is time intensive, difficult, and prone to bias and errors. Unintentional bias and attentional limitations during analysis of biomarkers can underlie poor reproducibility of findings in biomedical research and potentially introduce error in clinical diagnostics. We recently developed a “beta” software package designed to improve automation and standardization of image analysis, called “PIPSQUEAK” (Perineuronal net Intensity Program for the Standardization and Quantification of Extracellular matrix Analysis Kit). Since its publication in 2016, PIPSQUEAK beta has amassed approximately 1,300 users worldwide who use it to quantify the intensity and number of perineuronal nets and other neural markers in the brain. This technology significantly increases data reliability between image raters and decreases the time required for analysis by more than 100-fold. However, PIPSQUEAK beta currently uses target detection algorithms that require high-contrast images to automatically identify neurons as clusters of bright pixels on dark backgrounds. A significant current limitation to PIPSQUEAK beta, and other available imaging programs, is that detection of biomarkers can be difficult unless image conditions are ideal. Suboptimal conditions, like high background staining, off-target structures, overlapping or clustered biomarkers, and atypical morphologies, can lead to artifacts and consequently to inaccurate results and erroneous conclusions. Here, we propose to develop a user-friendly artificial intelligence (AI) platform for the automated detection of targeted biomarkers in digital microscopy that reduces this error by learning to distinguish between true cellular biomarkers and artifacts. We propose to integrate AI capabilities into our PIPSQUEAK technology to produce an adaptive, high-throughput, biomedical image analysis platform that quickly and accurately identifies biomarker targets from bench to bedside. A key advantage is that this AI program will be user friendly and available online, making it highly accessible to basic researchers and to technicians and clinicians identifying human pathologies. Thus, successful development of our AI program has a high translational potential. The goal of this proposal is 1) to develop and validate a machine learning model that is capable of detecting common histological marker morphologies in digital microscopy, and 2) to test the feasibility of adapting our AI platform to new biomarker datasets with minimal additional supervised training. Our end goal is to advance the reliability and speed of research findings and clinical diagnoses by making this technology widely available to researchers and clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Manual analysis of biomedical images by researchers and pathologists has the potential to introduces bias and error that compromise the reliability of research and clinical findings; problems which are significant barriers to delivering the most beneficial evidence-based medicine and developing effective medical treatments.

"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support students’ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",9778578,R44GM133245,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Gametogenesis', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Spinal Cord', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'egg', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'reading ability', 'resource guides', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2019,225000,0.0161892967181315
"Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  We propose to develop an automated critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) screening algorithm using machine learning techniques to combine non-invasive measurements of perfusion and oxygenation. Oxygen saturation (SpO2)-based screening is the current standard for CCHD screening, however it fails to detect up to 50% of asymptomatic newborns with CCHD or nearly 900 newborns in the United States annually. The majority of newborns missed by SpO2 screening have defects with aortic obstruction, such as coarctation of the aorta (CoA), that do not result in deoxygenated blood entering circulation. Non-invasive measurements of perfusion such as perfusion index (PIx) and pulse oximetry waveform analysis is expected to improve the detection of newborns with defects such as CoA, which is currently the most commonly missed CCHD by SpO2 screening. Both PIx and pulse oximetry waveforms can be measured non-invasively and with the same equipment used for SpO2 screening.  Members of our team recently showed that the addition of PIx, a non-invasive measurement of pulsatile blood flow, has the potential to improve CCHD detection otherwise missed by SpO2 screening. However, variability of PIx over brief time periods (seconds) and human error in its interpretation limit its clinical capabilities. Additionally, human error in interpretation of the current SpO2 screening algorithm leads to missed diagnoses and inappropriate testing in healthy newborns. Therefore, an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm is needed to both simplify the screening process, and improve detection of defects that are missed with SpO2 screening. In order to achieve that, we will identify the optimal PIx waveforms to create a metric that discriminates between newborns with and without CCHD. We will perform pulse oximetry waveform analysis to identify other non-invasive components with discriminatory capacity for newborns with CCHD. Additionally, we will apply supervised machine learning techniques to automate the algorithm interpretation.  The proposed research is significant because an automated SpO2-PIx screening algorithm could save the lives of hundreds of newborns with CCHD that are not diagnosed by SpO2 screening. Additionally, this is innovative as it will be the first automatic interpretation of PIx measurement among newborns with CCHD and merging of automated PIx and SpO2, which will allow for easy implementation at later steps. Through collaboration with four pediatric cardiac centers, we will establish the infrastructure and necessary multidisciplinary relationships to conduct future multicenter studies to evaluate this novel combined SpO2-PIx algorithm on a large scale involving thousands of newborns. Improving the detection of CCHD will require a multidisciplinary approach among all the individuals involved in the care and screening of newborns with CCHD. Additionally, collaboration with engineering and computer sciences will be necessary to automate the SpO2-PIx CCHD screening algorithm. PROJECT NARRATIVE A screening approach that improves earlier detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction is critically necessary. This application seeks to develop a screening algorithm that will combine the current screening standard, oxygen saturation, with non-invasive measurements of perfusion. This high risk, high reward approach is fundamentally different from other approaches as it will use machine learning techniques, and is expected to improve the detection of critical congenital heart defects with systemic obstruction and automate the interpretation of the screening results.","Improving Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening and Detection of ""Secondary"" Targets",9805011,R21HD099239,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Aortic coarctation', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Critical Congenital Heart Defects', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal Screening', 'New York', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obstruction', 'Oxygen', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pulsatile Flow', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research', 'Savings', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'aortic arch', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'congenital heart disorder', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'human error', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infant death', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'screening', 'supervised learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2019,240804,-0.03937725758165887
"Integrative Learning to Combine Evidence for Personalized Treatment Strategies. Project Summary:  Mental disorders represent immense healthcare burdens. Intense efforts and resources have been devoted to developing pharmacological and behavioral treatments for mental disorders, but no universally effective treatments are available. Considerable heterogeneity exists in treatment response among individuals with mental disorders, in part because an individual patient's psychosocial characteristics and/or biomarkers are not accounted for when selecting among available treatment options. Barriers to implement personalized treatments in clinical psychiatry include a lack of evidence-based, clinically interpretable, individualized treatment rules (ITRs), a lack of power to detect treatment modifiers from a single study, and a lack of reproducibility for treatment rules estimated from single studies. We propose analytic solutions to tackle these barriers. Specifically, we will provide integrative machine learning methods to build powerful, yet interpretable, individualized treatment strategies that can be easily applied in clinical practice. We will integrate evidence of ITRs identified in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to increase robustness and reproducibility. In Aim 1, we will provide piece-wise linear decision trees that are  transparent, interpretable, and that have guaranteed performance. Our decision trees will simultaneously identify the optimal treatment for a given patient (qualitative interaction) and subgroups of patients with large benefit  (quantitative interaction). In Aim 2, we propose a novel integrative analysis to synthesize evidence across trials and provide an integrative ITR that improves efficiency and reproducibility. Our method does not require all studies to collect common sets of variables and thus allows evidence to be combined from ITRs identified in recent RCTs that collected emerging biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging measures) with earlier RCTs that focused on clinical and  behavioral markers. In response to the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to center mental health research around “dimensional psychological constructs” shared across disorders, the methods will be applied to a wide range of RCTs that recruited patients with major depressive disorder and other co-morbid mental disorders. This strategy allows examination of ITRs for constructs shared across disorders and will increase generalizability. We will apply our methods to various RCTs, including data available from the  National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness. This research will bridge approaches for personalized medicine and integrative analysis in an effort to better understand the complex interplay between biomarkers and clinical manifestations in the context of selecting the best treatments for patients with mental disorders. Project Narrative:  Treatment responses for mental disorders are inadequate and considerable heterogeneity is observed, in part because an individual patient's clinical, psychosocial, and/or biological markers are not accounted for when select- ing treatments among available options.

"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder.

"SCH: INT: Computational Tools for Avoidaint/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder  Intellectual Merit: This project will for the first time provide the fundamental tools to integrate unique multimodal data toward screening, diagnosis, and intervention in eating disorders, with an initial focus on children with ARFID and related developmental and health disorders. This work is critical for enriching the understanding of healthy development and for broadening the foundations of behavioral data science. ARFID ·motivates the development of new computer vision and data analysis tools critical for the analysis of multidimensional behavioral data. The main aims are: 1. Develop and user individualized and integrated continuous facial affect coding from videos to discern affective motivations for food avoidance, critical due to the unique sensory aspects of eating disorders, and resulting from active stimulation via friendly and carefully designed images/videos and real food presentation; 2. Use data analysis and machine learning to derive sensory profiles based on patterns of food consumption and preference from existing unique datasets of selective eaters; and 3. Translate the tools developed in Aims 1 and 2 into the clinic and home to assess the capacity of these tools to define a threshold of clinically significant food avoidance, to detect change in acceptability of food with repeated presentations, and to examine and modify the accuracy of our food suggestion algorithms. Broader Impacts: The impact of this application comprises two broad domains. First is the derivation of processes, tools, and strategies to analyze very disparate data across multiple levels of analysis and to codify those strategies to inform similar future work, in particular incorporating automatic behavioral coding. Second is the exploitation of these tools to address questions about the emergence of healthy/unhealthy food selectivity across the lifespan, including recommendation delivery via apps and at-home recordings. The health impact of even partial success in this project is very broad and significant. Undergraduate students will be involved in this project via the 6-weeks summer research program at the Information Initiative at Duke, a center dedicated to the fundamentals of data science and its applications; via the co-Pl's research lab devoted to eating disorders; and via the Pl's project dedicated to training undergraduate students to address eating disorders of their friends via an anonymous app. Outreach and dissemination will follow the broad use of the developed app, both in the clinic and the general population, including the Pl's connections with low-income and under-represented bi-lingual preK. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Eating disorders are potentially life-threatening mental illnesses affecting the general population; -90% of individuals never receive treatment, in part due to lack of awareness and access. Individuals with eating disorders experience a diminished quality of life, high mental and physical illness comorbidities, and an existence marked by profound loneliness and isolation. Combining expertise in eating disorders with computer vision and machine learning, we bring for the first time data science to this health challenge.

"QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring Modern health monitoring devices at hospitals and wearable sensors in households generate a large amount of time series data at high rate, capturing the physiological status of patients in a real-lime fashion. The premise is that these technology advances enable a data-driven healthcare system that starts making fast, accurate, objective and inexpensive decisions based upon data, in addition to an individual physician's experience and preference. However, there is a significant gap in the mathematical theory and computational tools to promptly extract actionable information from multi-modal non-stationary time series data in a robust and tractable manner, which has become a serious roadblock to further utilize bigger data for better healthcare monitoring. The goal of this research program is to develop a mathematical framework for extracting time-frequency and geometric representations of multi-modal physiological data, in an online and robust manner, and use them to design machine learning algorithms to improve real-lime health monitoring. Specifically, we hypothesize that the development of time-series and geometric methods for large streaming multi-modal monitoring data will lead to more accurate diagnosis on various physiological monitoring applications, including detection and prediction of rare events such as seizure and arrhythmia, classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, and real-time artifact removal of physiological data. To achieve our goal, we plan to develop novel theoretical and computational tools for analyzing non-stationary multi-modal time series data with noise, corruption and missing data as well as real-time algorithms for filtering and event detection from such data. The tools and algorithms will be applied on clinical tasks at the Nationwide Children's Hospital. In addition, the real-time workflow will be implemented on Hadoop clusters with a mission of public sharing of both data and software. The development from the interdisciplinary team composed of mathematicians, biomedical informaticians as well as the hospital will not only transform the frontiers of mathematics knowledge, but also significantly impact clinical applications, data science education, and the development of the $11 O billion emerging market of wireless health. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel computational theory and software to extract physiological information from the large multi-modal data streams generated by modern health monitoring devices.

"Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Individual sleep disorders and characteristics are known to be associated with adverse health outcomes. However, few studies consider sleep in a multivariate context. Therefore, we propose a paradigmatic shift in sleep research towards sleep health. Conducting research through a sleep health lens can change health practice by clarifying which sleep characteristics are most important to treat, enhancing screening efforts, and facilitating the generalization of findings to all individuals, not just those with specific sleep disorders or complaints. Before achieving these long-term goals, however, the crucial first steps in the study of sleep health are to determine which sleep profiles predict health outcomes (Aim 1), and develop predictive algorithms that can identify individuals at risk of adverse health outcomes based on their sleep and other risk factors (Aim 2). These aims can only be achieved with an awareness of the statistical challenges related to the inherent multidimensionality of sleep health (e.g. multiple domains of sleep, multiple characteristics to represent each domain, multiple data sources, etc.). This multidimensionality generates substantial methodological barriers regarding variable and model selection and threatens researchers' abilities to develop transparent and reproducible models. In this R01, investigators will apply rigorous, sophisticated statistical methods to a large aggregated sample of adults aged >60 with self-report and polysomnographic characterization and over 10 years of longitudinal follow-up from three parent studies: Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Sleep Study (MrOS), Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). In Aim 1, investigators will determine which multidimensional sleep profiles predict time to mortality in older adults using Cox-proportional hazards models, tree-structured survival analysis, and clustering. In Aim 2, investigators will develop powerful machine learning algorithms that incorporate sleep and other risk factors to identify which older adults have the greatest risk for early mortality. Within each aim, the impact of sex and race will be rigorously investigated, and models will be internally validated in independent samples to ensure reproducibility. The Secondary Aim is to investigate generalizability to studies with different demographic profiles and sleep protocols (Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, Honolulu Asia Aging Study of Sleep America) and different data types (sleep diary, actigraphy). All models will be developed in the context of other important known risk factors, including but not limited to age, gender, race, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and BMI. Findings from Aim 1 will jumpstart subsequent mechanistic research focused on sleep-related causal factors of mortality, leading to identification of targeted treatments for sleep problems that could reduce risk of mortality and morbidity. Findings from Aim 2 will provide important preliminary evidence for enhanced screening tools that can more accurately identify which individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project initiates a paradigmatic research shift by studying multivariate sleep health in older adults. Cutting- edge statistical methods will be applied to a large, multi-cohort sample, and replicability of findings will be rigorously investigated. Achieving the proposed aims will improve health practice by: (1) determining which multivariate sleep profiles predict mortality in older adults, thereby jumpstarting subsequent mechanistic research on sleep-related causal factors of mortality and targeted treatments to reduce mortality; and (2) suggesting prediction algorithms that incorporate sleep to enhance health screening for adverse health outcomes in older adults.",Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods,9722990,R01AG056331,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Americas', 'Asia', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Vision', 'Wakefulness', 'Well in self', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'actigraphy', 'aged', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'diaries', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'health practice', 'improved', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prediction algorithm', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sex', 'sleep health', 'sleep pattern', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,260797,0.003640190643839921
"UC Davis Alzheimer's Core Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT As reflected in recent budget increases in the National Institutes of Health, and in line with the National Alzheimer’s Project Act, there is a need to enhance and leverage resources to decrease dementia disparities and change the trajectory of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. To fill this gap, we seek to enhance the University of California Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Center (UCD ADC), which contains a diverse ethnoracial cohort (having Hispanic, Black, and non-Hispanic White decedents), through implementation of digital pathology within our Neuropathology Core. This implementation will allow for rapid transmission of pathological data for consultation and collaborations, distribution of materials for educational purposes, tissue specimen archiving, and image analysis. In addition, by having a digital pathology with immunofluorescent capabilities will allow for viewing of the distribution (including overlap) of multiple proteins at one time within a tissue specimen. This can enhance biological studies by providing spatial relationships of proteins resulting in a deeper phenotype of disease. This supplement application is designed to support equipment and leverage and enhance infrastructure to allow the UCD ADC the ability to 1) purchase a whole slide image system to digitize existing and future histologically stained samples 2) leverage and enhance current servers and database systems to allow for storage and rapid retrieval of digital images and their data and 3) leverage and enhance hardware to develop and deploy pipelines for quantitative computational methodologies for pathologies found within a diverse ethnoracial cohort of Alzheimer’s disease brains. The UCD ADC continues to excel and expand in its research initiatives to collect and provide brain specimens and pathological data on a diverse population of individuals at various stages of cognitive ability and dementia risk. This supplement will further enable suitable infrastructure for enhancement of current collaborations and facilitate emerging collaborations by providing a means to share and analysis pathology on digitized whole slide images. PROJECT NARRATIVE Digital microscopy paired with machine learning algorithms has aided in diagnosis and provide more quantitative pathology data to unlock the secrets of diseases. These technologies are needed within the dementia field, specifically in diverse cohorts, as disease presentations may differ. By implementing state of the art imaging systems and analysis, the goals of this supplement are to enhance the ADC’s ability to provide greater access to high quality pathological data for educational, consultation and collaborative purposes, infrastructure to pursue digital solutions for more quantitative analysis, and safe secure storage of histologic specimens.",UC Davis Alzheimer's Core Center,9852188,P30AG010129,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Archives', 'Autopsy', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Budgets', 'California', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational Materials', 'Equipment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glass', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Knowledge', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Senile Plaques', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Thioflavin S', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'beta pleated sheet', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disease phenotype', 'histological specimens', 'histological stains', 'human tissue', 'imaging system', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuropathology', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'spatial relationship', 'synergism', 'transmission process', 'whole slide imaging']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P30,2019,289154,-0.052772639339521796
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9735365,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'post stroke', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,302394,-0.0012640970268326431
"Statistical Methods in Trans-Omics Chronic Disease Research Project Summary The broad, long-term objectives of this research are the development of novel and high-impact statistical methods for medical studies of chronic diseases, with a focus on trans-omics precision medicine research. The speciﬁc aims of this competing renewal application include: (1) derivation of efﬁcient and robust statistics for integrative association analysis of multiple omics platforms (DNA sequences, RNA expressions, methylation proﬁles, protein expressions, metabolomics proﬁles, etc.) with arbitrary patterns of missing data and with detection limits for quantitative measurements; (2) exploration of statistical learning approaches for handling multiple types of high- dimensional omics variables with structural associations and with substantial missing data; and (3) construction of a multivariate regression model of the effects of somatic mutations on gene expressions in cancer tumors for discovery of subject-speciﬁc driver mutations, leveraging gene interaction network information and accounting for inter-tumor heterogeneity in mutational effects. All these aims have been motivated by the investigators' applied research experience in trans-omics studies of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The proposed solutions are based on likelihood and other sound statistical principles. The theoretical properties of the new statistical methods will be rigorously investigated through innovative use of advanced mathematical arguments. Computationally efﬁcient and numerically stable algorithms will be developed to implement the inference procedures. The new methods will be evaluated extensively with simulation studies that mimic real data and applied to several ongoing trans-omics precision medicine projects, most of which are carried out at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Their scientiﬁc merit and computational feasibility are demonstrated by preliminary simulation results and real examples. Efﬁcient, reliable, and user-friendly open-source software with detailed documentation will be produced and disseminated to the broad scientiﬁc community. The proposed work will advance the ﬁeld of statistical genomics and facilitate trans-omics precision medicine studies of chronic diseases.

"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements (DS) and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); our ability to readily identify interactions between DS with prescription medications is currently very limited. To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored. Our long-term goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate its findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support systems. The objective of this application is to develop an informatics framework to enable the discovery of DSIs by creating a DS terminology and mining scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. Towards these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Compile a comprehensive DS terminology using online resources; and (2) Discover potential DSIs from the biomedical literature. The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel informatics paradigm and resources for identifying most clinically significant DSI signals and their biological mechanisms. This information is critical to subsequent efforts aimed at improving patient safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The results from this study are imperative in order to achieve the ultimate goal of reducing an individual’s risk of potential DSIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will address a critical and unmet need to conduct large-scale clinical research in drug-supplement interactions (DSIs) and improve evidence bases for healthcare practice.

"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,9705993,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,314000,-0.015003055904396705
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,9658873,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Beds', 'Bypass', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Practices', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Head Start Program', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Preschool Child', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data mining', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'sensor', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment group', 'wearable device']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,317858,0.0002410193597453033
"Common Fund Data Supplement: Integration of KOMP2 (IMPC) and PHAROS into MARRVEL 2.0 for machine learning-assisted rare variant prioritization Project Summary  This application is being submitted in response to NOT-RM-19-009 as a supplement to the parent award U54NS093793.  The Common Fund supports a number of resources that can significantly enhance gene and variant prioritization for study in the Model Organisms Screening Center of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network and beyond. To facilitate the use of these resources, we propose to create a tool that can be easily accessed by clinical geneticists and model organism scientists alike.  MARRVEL (Model organism Aggregated Resources for Rare Variant ExpLoration) was created two years ago because important data that is necessary for rare variant analysis for personalized medicine is spread throughout the internet in tens of different locations. To improve efficiency and streamline access to these data sources, we created a web-tool that allows users to query tens of data sources at once, including GTEx, and links to IMPC, the display portal for KOMP2.  In this proposal, our goal is to develop version 2 of MARRVEL to promote the use of Common Fund resources in the rare disease research community for manual and automated data analysis. This goal will be accomplished by developing MARRVEL 2.0 by integrating KOMP2 (IMPC) and PHAROS data and using the aggregated dataset to develop a machine-assisted gene and variant prioritization for diagnosis and animal model generation.  Our goals align with those of the NIH Common Fund to increase the utility of resources for broader use in the biomedical community. Project Narrative  We aim to promote the use of Common Fund resources and facilitate the diagnosis of rare diseases and the subsequent generation of animal models for the Undiagnosed Diseases Network and beyond.

"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9702876,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,328340,0.0022010223718931356
"Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository Three-dimensional anatomic modeling and simulation (3D M&S) in cardiovascular (CV) disease have become a crucial component of treatment planning, medical device design, diagnosis, and FDA approval. Comprehensive, curated 3-D M&S databases are critical to enable grand challenges, and to advance model reduction, shape analysis, and deep learning for clinical application. However, large-scale open data curation involving 3-D M&S present unique challenges; simulations are data intensive, physics-based models are increasingly complex and highly resolved, heterogeneous solvers and data formats are employed by the community, and simulations require significant high-performance computing resources. Manually curating a large open-data repository, while ensuring the contents are verified and credible, is therefore intractable. We aim to overcome these challenges by developing broadly applicable automated curation data science to ensure model credibility and accuracy in 3-D M&S, leveraging our team’s expertise in CV simulation, uncertainty quantification, imaging science, and our existing open data and open source projects. Our team has extensive experience developing and curating open data and software resources. In 2013, we launched the Vascular Model Repository (VMR), providing 120 publicly-available datasets, including medical image data, anatomic vascular models, and blood flow simulation results, spanning numerous vascular anatomies and diseases. The VMR is compatible with SimVascular, the only fully open source platform providing state-of-the-art image-based blood flow modeling and analysis capability to the CV simulation community. We propose that novel curation science will enable the VMR to rapidly intake new data while automatically assessing model credibility, creating a unique resource to foster rigor and reproducibility in the CV disease community with broad application in 3D M&S. To accomplish these goals, we propose three specific aims: 1) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of anatomic patient-specific models built from medical image data, 2) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of 3D blood flow simulation results, 3) Disseminate the data curation suite and expanded VMR. The proposed research is significant and innovative because it will 1) enable rapid expansion of the repository by limiting curator intervention during data intake, leveraging compatibility with SimVascular, 2) increase model credibility in the CV simulation community, 3) apply novel supervised and unsupervised approaches to evaluate anatomic model fidelity, 4) leverage reduced order models for rapid assessment of complex 3D data. This project assembles a unique team of experts in cardiovascular simulation, the developers of SimVascular and creator of the VMR, a professional software engineer, and radiology technologists. We will build upon our successful track record of launching and supporting open source and open data resources to ensure success. Data curation science for 3D M&S will have direct and broad impacts in other physiologic systems and to ultimately impact clinical care in cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular anatomic models and blood flow simulations are increasingly used for personalized surgical planning, medical device design, and the FDA approval process. We propose to develop automated data curation science to rapidly assess credibility of anatomic models and 3D simulation data, which present unique challenges for large-scale data curation. Leveraging our open source SimVascular project, the proposed project will enable rapid expansion of the existing Vascular Model Repository while ensuring model credibility and reproducibility to foster innovation in clinical and basic science cardiovascular research.",Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository,9859232,R01LM013120,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Basic Science', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Engineering', 'Source Code', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'computing resources', 'data format', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gigabyte', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'online repository', 'open data', 'open source', 'repository', 'respiratory', 'shape analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'stem', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'supervised learning', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'unsupervised learning', 'web portal']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,345016,-0.01008001813503518
"Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis Project Summary Clinical trials are foundational to evidence-based medicine, but results reporting from trials is incomplete and frequently delayed. It is estimated that as many as half of clinical trials are not published and as many as half of published trials underreport or misreport outcomes. This type of results reporting distorts the evidence available to clinicians—particularly when it comes to assessing the safety of interventions like drugs and devices—and may place patients at unnecessary risk. There is a critical need for novel methods to identify and monitor drug safety data. Through the infrastructure provided by ClinicalTrials.gov, structured trial results (including safety findings) are now becoming available for an increasing number of trials in a comprehensive and timely fashion. However, access and use of these data in evidence synthesis tasks remain limited. ClinicalTrials.gov is the largest single registry for clinical studies worldwide and includes more than 260,000 registered studies. Of the 108,941 completed trials registered with the site, 20% have uploaded results data for a total of 7.85 million participants. Results data reported on ClinicalTrials.gov have the potential to fill gaps created by delays and biases in published articles and provide an earlier and more complete overview of available trial evidence. We propose to develop novel informatics approaches based on combinations of information retrieval and machine learning methods to facilitate access and analysis of trial results reported in this registry. Focusing on trials testing drug interventions in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and oncology, we perform this work in three specific aims: 1) Develop semi-automated trial screening for identifying and aggregating trials relevant to a clinical intervention; 2) Extract adverse event and safety outcomes data from results reported in the registry; and 3) Perform validation studies to assess detection of adverse events and performance of semi- automated meta-analyses of safety outcomes. Methods developed in this project will facilitate timely, broad- scale use of trial results reported on ClinicalTrials.gov in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data. All methods will be made publicly available in order to support adverse event monitoring and systematic reviews of drug interventions. Project Narrative The availability of results from clinical trials is frequently incomplete or delayed, limiting the evidence available to clinicians making treatment decisions. When results on the safety of interventions, such as drugs, are not properly disseminated, patients may be exposed to harm. National policies require comprehensive and timely reporting of trial results in trial registries (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov), representing a novel data type that could be used for drug safety surveillance. However, the use of these data has remained limited to date. We propose innovative informatics methods to enable access and analysis of this emerging data source in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data.",Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis,9641903,R01LM012976,"['Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Bibliographic Databases', 'Bibliography', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consumption', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug usage', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse event monitoring', 'base', 'cluster trial', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'drug testing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medication safety', 'novel', 'oncology', 'rosiglitazone', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'trial design', 'validation studies', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,347250,-0.03494224028183452
"Big Flow Cytometry Data: Data Standards, Integration and Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Flow cytometry is a single-cell measurement technology that is data-rich and plays a critical role in basic research and clinical diagnostics. The volume and dimensionality of data sets currently produced with modern instrumentation is orders of magnitude greater than in the past. Automated analysis methods in the field have made great progress in the past five years. The tools are available to perform automated cell population identification, but the infrastructure, methods and data standards do not yet exist to integrate and compare non-standardized big flow cytometry data sets available in public repositories. This proposal will develop the data standards, software infrastructure and computational methods to enable researchers to leverage the large amount of public cytometry data in order to integrate, re-analyze, and draw novel biological insights from these data sets. The impact of this project will be to provide researchers with tools that can be used to bridge the gap between inference from isolated single experiments or studies, to insights drawn from large data sets from cross-study analysis and multi-center trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE The aims of this project are to develop standards, software and methods for integrating and analyzing big and diverse flow cytometry data sets. The project will enable users of cytometry to directly compare diverse and non-standardized cytometry data to each other and make biological inferences about them.

"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9608754,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computational suite', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,356625,-0.00033272829342562827
"Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance, impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,” given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and interpretation. Preliminary data including drug screening, modeling morphological changes in cancer, cardiac image reconstruction, modeling subcellular organization, and others are discussed. Mathematical data analysis algorithms have enabled great advances in technology for building predictive models from biological data which have been useful for learning about cells and organs, as well as for stratifying patient subgroups in different diseases, and other applications. Given their lack to fundamental biophysics properties, the modeling approaches in current existence (e.g. numerical feature engineering, artificial neural networks) have significant short-comings when applied to biological data analysis problems. The project describes a new mathematical data analysis approach, rooted on transport and related phenomena, which is aimed at greatly enhance our ability to extract meaning from diverse biomedical datasets, while augmenting the accuracy of predictions.",Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science,9642618,R01GM130825,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cartilage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'absorption', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'brain morphology', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'electric impedance', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'gray matter', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mathematical theory', 'microscopic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'neural network', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2019,375602,-0.00761278682954207

"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract In alignment with RFA-DA-19-008, this application seeks to establish the Great Lakes Node (GLN) of the NIDA-supported Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN). This node will draw on an experienced set of investigators who have active collaborations and represent all of the major academic medical centers in the Greater Chicago and Wisconsin areas. The node will serve as a vital Midwestern hub for the CTN and will expand on the success of the CTN approach. In addition, the GLN will bring substantial experience in adolescent/young adult research, seniors/aging research, digital & mobile technologies, opioid misuse, collaborative care/population health, telehealth, and electronic health record and systems-driven interventions and research methodologies. The GLN will support engagement with CTN protocols and also add the following: Aim 1: GLN will identify and recommend substance misuse research and intervention protocols focused on systems-based practice using hospital-based screening, collaborative care, and population approaches. Aim 2: We will establish a digital and computation health core that will leverage our expertise in these domains and serve as a conduit for studies in mHealth, eHealth, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and telehealth interventions. Aim 3: Our node will bring substantial expertise with youth/adolescent health and seniors/aging that will enable us to recommend studies to the CTN that examine the genesis of substance misuse and the potential for prevention strategies to mitigate these life-course pathways. Aim 4: In alignment with our team’s expertise, we plan to support work on substance and opioid misuse that focuses on health disparities including socioeconomic, geographic, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Aim 5: Leveraging our experience in professional education and practice-based learning, our node will rigorously test the impact of professional education on opioid and substance treatment. We have built on the ECHO model to develop methods to conduct high-quality distance education and supported training that are currently being trialed in Illinois with plans to expand these programs nationally. Aim 6: GLN will expand the pipeline of early investigators interested in substance misuse research. We will align this part of our program with our very successful CTSA-supported programs and build specific subprogramming that supports addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship.

"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,9862231,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Body part', 'Cannabidiol', 'Carbamazepine', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clonazepam', 'Clonus', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Face', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phenytoin', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Specificity', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Valproic Acid', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior test', 'drug use screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'selective expression', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,450365,-0.005142827672479182
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,9760006,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat', 'computational platform', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,501996,-0.005727284004059976
"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,9816009,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative treatment', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'national surveillance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,502815,0.011498520927176084
"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases users’ independence by responding to them without another person’s intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the user’s position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the user’s body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale. People who are essentially quadriplegic, with significant mobility impairments and limited to no upper extremity use, are dependent on others to maintain proper positioning for access to devices essential for their health, mobility and communication, such as eye gaze speech devices, call systems, phones, tablets, wheelchair controls, and hydration and suctioning tubes. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision to detect specific targets, such as facial features, to control a robotic mounting and positioning system; automatically repositioning devices for best access without assistance from others, even when their position changes. This technology enables continuous access to communication, maintains one’s ability to drive a wheelchair and allows a person to drink or suction themselves, providing good hydration, respiratory health and hygiene.",Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions,9750520,R44HD093467,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Hydration status', 'Hygiene', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lighting', 'Logic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Research Design', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Saliva', 'Self Care', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spastic Tetraplegia', 'Speech', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Suction', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tube', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Variant', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'body system', 'commercialization', 'communication device', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'manufacturability', 'meetings', 'product development', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'research and development', 'respiratory health', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"BLUE SKY DESIGNS, INC.",R44,2019,507856,-0.03853976920029012
"An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis Project Summary  Improved methods for the bedside diagnosis and evaluation of neuromuscular disorders are needed. One technology that is finding increasing use for this purpose is electrical impedance myography (EIM). In EIM, a very weak, high frequency electrical current is passed through a muscle of interest and the resulting surface voltages are measured. Disease associated alterations in the composition and microstructural features of the muscle produce characteristic changes that can be used to help classify specific conditions and grade disease severity. To date, most studies using EIM analysis have utilized a fairly limited data set for disease assessment. While effective, this approach ignores a great deal of information locked within the impedance data, including those values that can assist in predicting specific muscle features (such as myofiber diameter) and the presence of pathological change (e.g., fat or connective tissue deposition). In addition, as it stands, the data set is challenging for the clinician to understand without a detailed knowledge of impedance theory. Myolex, Inc is a small business concern located in Boston, MA has as its main focus the development of EIM technologies for clinical use. Myolex recently completed a Phase 1 SBIR that demonstrated the potential capability of machine learning based classification algorithms to effectively discriminate healthy muscle from diseased and to discriminate one disease from another. In this proposed work, we will greatly advance this concept by embodying classification algorithms into a powerful new software suite for Myolex’s current EIM system, the mView. Our underlying hypothesis is that EIM data analysis can be automated to the point that classification systems can provide data on disease diagnosis as well as disease severity for improved ease-of-use. We propose to study this hypothesis via 2 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will design a software suite capable of assisting with artifact-free data collection to be incorporated into our current EIM system, the mViewTM. Then using classification paradigms based on a prodigious amount of previous collected data, we will develop an automated data analysis tool to help provide data on disease category as well as microscopic features, muscle based on the impedance data alone using Microsoft’s Azure Cloud platform. In Specific Aim 2, we will test this developed software suite in a total of180 adult and pediatric neuromuscular disease patients and healthy participants evaluated at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (adults) and Boston Children’s Hospital (children). During this data collection period, the Ohio State and Boston Children’s researchers will have real- time access to Myolex staff to provide feedback and have questions/problems answered and addressed. The user interface will continue to be refined and classification algorithms improved. At the conclusion of this work, a new diagnostic tool will be developed for potential 510(k) FDA approval. It will serve as the basis for a continuously self-refining system as additional data sets are collected by end-users employing them in regular clinical use. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a valuable technique to assist with the evaluation of a variety of conditions affecting nerve and muscle. However, to date, only simplistic EIM outcomes have been utilized to assess muscle condition. In this proposed work, we will develop a software platform using machine learning to be incorporated into current EIM technology to allow for automated diseased classification and characterization using the entire large EIM data set collected with each muscle measurement. This will serve as the basis for a new, powerful and convenient tool for neuromuscular diagnosis that will continue to advance over time.",An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis,9846955,R44NS113756,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Technology', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Nerve', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercialization', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric patients', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'sarcopenia', 'software development', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'voltage']",NINDS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R44,2019,621318,0.00375785951469254
"Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine The application of new computerized methods of data analysis to vast collections of medical, biological, and other data is emerging as a central feature of a broad vision of precision medicine (PM) in which systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) assist clinicians in treatment, diagnosis, or prognosis. The use of AI to analyze big data for clinical decision-making opens up a new domain for ELSI inquiry to address a possible future when the implications of genetics and genomics become embedded into algorithms, pervasive yet implicit and difficult to identify. Thus, an important target of inquiry is the development and developers of these algorithms. There are three distinctive features of the application of AI, and in particular machine learning (ML), to the domain of PM that create the need for ELSI inquiry. First, the process of developing ML-based systems for PM goals is technically and organizationally complex. Thus, members of development teams will likely have different expertise and assumptions about norms, responsibilities, and regulation. Second, machine learning does not solely operate through predetermined rules, and is thus difficult to hold accountable for its conclusions or reasoning. Third, designers of ML systems for PM may be subject to diverse and divergent interests and needs of multiple stakeholders, yet unaware of the associated ethical and values implications for design. These distinctive features of ML in PM could lead to difficulties in detecting misalignment of design with values, and to breakdown in responsibility for realignment. Because machine learning in the context of precision medicine is such a new phenomenon, we have very little understanding of actual practices, work processes and the specific contexts in which design decisions are made. Importantly, we have little knowledge about the influences and constraints on these decisions, and how they intersect with values and ethical principles. Although the field of machine learning for precision medicine is still in its formative stage, there is growing recognition that designers of AI systems have responsibilities to ask such questions about values and ethics. In order to ask these questions, designers must first be aware that there are values expressed by design. Yet, there are few practical options for designers to learn how to increase awareness. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 To map the current state of ML in PM by identifying and cataloging existing US-based ML in PM  projects and by exploring a range of values expressed by stakeholders about the use of ML in PM through  a combination of multi-method review, and interviews of key informants and stakeholders. Aim 2 To characterize decisions and rationales that shape ML in PM and explore whether and how  developers perceive values as part of these rationales through interviews of ML developers and site visits. Aim 3 To explore the feasibility of using design rationale as a framework for increasing awareness of the  existence of values, and multiple sources of values, in decisions about ML in PM through group-based  exercises with ML developers from academic and commercial settings. The overall goal of this project is to understand how to encourage and enable people who are developing artificial intelligence for personalized health care to be aware of values in their daily practice. We will examine actual practices and contexts in which design decisions are made for precision medicine applications, and use this information to design group-based workshop exercises to increase awareness of values.",Integrating Ethics into Machine Learning for Precision Medicine,9713512,R01HG010476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'new technology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized health care', 'precision medicine']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,647706,0.01820655418601596
"PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository The confluence of new machine learning (ML) data-driven approaches; increased computational power; and access to the wealth of electronic health records (EHRs) and other emergent types of data (e.g., omics, imaging, mHealth) are accelerating the development of biomedical predictive models. Such models range from traditional statistical approaches (e.g., regression) through to more advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., convolutional neural networks, CNNs), and span different tasks (e.g., biomarker/pathway discovery, diagnostic, prognostic). Two issues have become evident: 1) as there are no comprehensive standards to support the dissemination of these models, scientific reproducibility is problematic, given challenges in interpretation and implementation; and 2) as new models are put forth, methods to assess differences in performance, as well as insights into external validity (i.e., transportability), are necessary. Tools moving beyond the sharing of data and model “executables” are needed, capturing the (meta)data necessary to fully reproduce a model and its evaluation. The objective of this R01 is the development of an informatics standard supporting the requisite information for scientific reproducibility for statistical and ML-based biomedical predictive models; from this foundation, we then develop new computational approaches to compare models' performance. We begin by extending the current Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard to fully characterize biomedical datasets and harmonize variable definitions; to elucidate the algorithms involved in model creation (e.g., data preprocessing, parameter estimation); and to explain the validation methodology. Importantly, models in this PMML format will become findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (i.e., following FAIR principles). We then propose novel meth- ods to compare and contrast predictive models, assessing transportability across datasets. While metrics exist for comparing models (e.g., c-statistics, calibration), often the required case-level information is not available to calculate these measures. We thus introduce an approach to simulate cases based on a model's reported da- taset statistics, enabling such calculations. Different levels of transportability are then assigned to the metrics, determining the extent to which a selected model is applicable to a given population/cohort (i.e., helping answer the question, can I use this published model with my own data?). We tie these efforts together in our proposed framework, the PREdictive Model Index & Exchange REpository (PREMIERE). We will develop an online portal and repository for model sharing around PREMIERE, and our efforts will include fostering a community of users to guide its development through workshops, model-thons, and other activities. To demonstrate these efforts, we will bootstrap PREMIERE with predictive models from a targeted domain (risk assessment in imaging-based lung cancer screening). Our efforts to evaluate these developments will engage a range of stakeholders (model developers, users) to inform the completeness of our standard; and biostatisticians and clinical experts to guide assessment of model transportability. PROGRAM NARRATIVE With growing access to information contained in the electronic health record and other data sources, the appli- cation of statistical and machine learning methods are generating more biomedical predictive models. However, there are significant challenges to reproducing these models for purposes of comparison and application in new environments/populations.

"Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning Summary Phages, which are the naturally evolved predators of bacteria, may hold the key to combating bacterial pathogens, including the looming threat of multidrug resistant bacteria. Phages are viruses which while harmless to humans and have been successfully engineered as tools to separate, concentrate, and detect their bacterial hosts. Additionally, phages have been used as therapeutic agents to treat patients infected with pathogens resistant to known antibiotics. While the potential benefits of phages are numerous, certain limitations must be addressed in order to fully employ them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both top-down and bottom-up approaches can be utilized to design and synthesize novel phages, through a combination of synthetic biology and machine learning. This will result in phage-based tools with increased functionality and customizable host ranges. The rationale for the proposed research is that as the threat of bacterial infections including those with multi-drug resistance continues to grow, phages, which have evolved to efficiently recognize and kill bacteria, will become indispensable tools. Therefore, the ability to rapidly design and engineer new phages for biosensing and therapeutics will be a critical advantage to human health. The proposal contains three specific aims which are supported by preliminary data and cited literature. Aim 1: Site-directed conjugation for advanced phage-based biosensors and therapeutics. Under this aim, phages will be modified with alkyne-containing unnatural amino acids allowing their direct conjugation to 1) azide decorated magnetic nanoparticles, and 2) azide terminated polyethylene glycol. The modifications will allow the development of magnetic phages for bacteria separation and detection, and phages that are more effective therapeutics due to their ability to avoid a patient’s innate immune response, respectively. Aim 2: Decoding phage biorecognition elements using machine learning. In this aim, machine learning will be used to model the binding of phages and their bacterial hosts. The model will enable the prediction of host interactions as well as allow the design and synthesis of novel phage tail fibers which can target specific bacterial isolates. Aim 3: Repurposing phage biorecognition for a broader host ranges. Under the final aim, phage-binding proteins will be replaced with those known to recognize conserved regions of the bacterial LPS, resulting in a phage with a much broader host range. This approach is innovative because it uses top-down characterizations for bottom-up design and synthesis of novel phages. Traditional phage screening methods will be replaced with the rapid synthesis of phages, which are optimized for a particular bacterial isolate. Following the successful completion of the specific aims, the expected outcome is the design and synthesis of phages that can be used to target a selected group of bacteria within Enterobacteriaceae for advanced biosensing and therapeutics. A publically available computer model will allow rapid design of custom phage biorecognition elements which can be added to functionalized phages. These technologies will allow researchers to tip the scales of the co-evolutionary arms race between phage and bacteria. Narrative The project is relevant to public health because it accelerates the development of phage-based tools for the rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in human, food, and environmental samples, and the treatment of diseases from multidrug resistant bacteria by integrating machine learning and synthetic biology. Thus, it is specifically relevant to part of NIH's mission that pertains to the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases.",Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning,9714883,R01EB027895,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Alkynes', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Azides', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophage T4', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Capsid', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Food', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Magnetism', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'arm', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'rapid detection', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIBIB,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,666637,-0.023063051207327212
"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9838368,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,687155,-0.003779022733642808
"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9789913,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,750000,0.0003399656103933519
"Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly (SPEEDe) ABSTRACT Adverse events (AEs) – harm to patients that results from medical care – affect as many as 13.5% of hospitalized patients; half of these AEs are preventable and AEs particularly affect the elderly. AEs are notoriously difficult to measure accurately. A variety of paper and electronic trigger tools have been developed to identify AEs; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) is low, requiting subsequent, time-intensive manual chart review to accurately measure AEs. In the proposed project, we will use innovative, state-of-the-art machine interactive learning (IML) techniques to refine existing AE triggers, improving their accuracy substantially. We will also develop a novel AE Explorer to speed review of possible AEs, as well as an innovative package of predictive analytics tools and methods to measure and detect them. Our approach combines and compares expert-driven improvement with the most recent IML techniques to make triggers more accurate, with the ultimate goal of creating triggers that are accurate enough to stand in as proxies for actual measurement of harm. We call our approach Safety Promotion through Early Event Detection in the Elderly, or SPEEDe. Our team of accomplished machine learning, patient safety, risk management, AE detection, geriatric medicine and trigger tool experts will work together to carry out the specific aims of this project: (1) prototype and rapidly iterate a trigger review dashboard (the Adverse Event Explorer) using a user-centered design process, (2) develop and evaluate novel Interactive Machine Learning approaches for more efficient and accurate adverse event chart review and trigger refinement, and (3) Integrate Interactive Machine Learning into the Adverse Event Explorer and evaluate it prospectively in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse events – harm to patients that results from medical care – are common and difficult to identify and measure using existing tools. Accurate real-time measures of adverse events would enable organizations to track harm over time, identify and prioritize areas for safety improvements, evaluate whether patient safety programs are effective, and communicate risks of harm to patients and caregivers.

"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology.

"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium.

"Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine Project Summary Cardiac surgery has been a highly innovative field of medicine. The introduction of major innovations, and ongoing incremental change in existing ones, have extended survival and improved quality of life for many patients suffering from cardiac disease. A rapid pace of innovation requires a rigorous infrastructure for clinical evaluation that provides timely assessments of the value of new and modified treatments. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) was created to provide a rigorous evidence base tor the surgical treatment of cardiothoracic disease. The International Center for Health Outcomes and Innovation Research (InCHOIR) enthusiastically embraces the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with clinical investigators and the NIH as the CTSN DCC. The Network has developed a rich research agenda for the renewal that includes trials of novel neuroprotective agents, long-term antithrombotic strategies, new regenerative medicine therapies, and surgical approaches to valvular disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Given our long-standing interest and experience in the design and analysis of cardiac surgery multicenter studies, we are in a strong position to serve as the coordinating center for this vital clinical research effort. In particular, we will provide leadership in designing novel trials that optimize sample size, include patient- centered as well as clinical endpoints, and collect data from a variety of sources, including electronic data capture systems, mobile apps and wearable sensors, registries and electronic health records. We have a strong track record of obtaining efficient regulatory approval for our trials from the FDA and Health Canada, training and monitoring sites nationally and internationally, ensuring robust enrollment and retention, data management and quality assurance, data sharing, and overall administrative coordination. We have the infrastructure to expand our trials to include mechanistic studies that use biospecimens collected and managed through the CTSN biorepository. Finally, the DCC plays an important role in the analysis, interpretation and dissemination of research findings. We will continue to support the process of publishing in high-impact journals that should lead to revision of practice guidelines and to surgical practice itself. This goal should be further optimized by incorporating Implementation Science approaches into Network trials, which should decrease the well-recognized gap between publication of trial results and adoption of findings into widespread practice. NARRATIVE Clinical trials are a critical step in translating discoveries into better treatments for people burdened by cardiac disorders. Such trials typically require cooperation and coordination among a broad range of investigators, patients, government agencies, and industry partners. The objective of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical research through shared infrastructure for important trials that will advance therapy for patients suffering from cardiac disease.",Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine,9753639,U01HL088942,"['Address', 'Administrative Coordination', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Ancillary Study', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Secure', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'electronic data', 'electronic data capture system', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'international center', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'performance site', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'research data dissemination', 'screening', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2019,7220733,0.004406298891781224
"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research. The conference brings together national experts on a host of topics ranging from bioethics to bioinformatics to biomedical informatics to speak and lead workshops on timely challenges posed in translating complex genomic and health data into clinical practice. The conference series also serves to promote diversity in the biomedical workforce.

"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9612777,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2018,39939,-0.08906768154142185
"An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics Project Summary Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper neurological development. During sleep, there is enhanced synaptic plasticity in the nervous system in addition to often extensive neural remodeling. Although we know that sleep regulation is important to neurological development, many aspects of sleep regulation are poorly understood. In particular, the mechanisms of how we compensate for missed sleep in future sleep cycles are mysterious, despite general knowledge of how circadian rhythms are established. It is likely that these mechanisms involve neuropeptide signaling in the brain. However, current tools to study the roles these peptides play in sleep homeostasis, even with the use of simple model organisms like C. elegans, are low- throughput, qualitative, and subjective. In order to study sleep-like behavior in C. elegans, there is an unmet need for a tool for continuously monitoring and perturbing long-term behavior of the worm, as well as an automated and un-biased method for quantifying behavioral data. In this proposal, we will first develop the enabling technology, and use it to identify the roles of neuropeptides in homeostasis of the nematode’s sleep- like state. In Aim I, we will engineer and validate a scalable microscopy platform for monitoring and perturbing C. elegans behavior, decreasing the cost of long-term candidate screens by ~ 100 fold. In Aim 2, we will quantify behavior of wild-type animals via an automated and bias-free quantitative analysis to establish baseline behavior and prioritize behaviors that are linked to sleep homeostasis. In Aim 3, we will use the technology developed in Aims I and 2 to quantify differences in behavior of C. elegans neuropeptide mutants using a candidate approach. Because of the strong preliminary data we have gathered so far and the experience of the sponsor’s laboratory, this proposed work is likely to identify the roles of these candidate neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis, contributing to our mechanistic understanding of sleep regulation. Furthermore, the tools we develop for this particular study will also have broad utilities in many other problems, such as developmental programming, aging, and neurobehavioral studies. Project Narrative Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper brain development and is linked to a variety of neurological and behavioral disorders. In particular, how animals correct for interrupted sleep cycles in future cycles could lead to therapeutic targets, but apart from a few implicated neuropeptides, little is known about the mechanisms behind this aspect of sleep. The objective of this proposal is to identify the roles of neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis by screening C. elegans mutants for behavioral defects.",An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics,9545566,F31GM123662,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drug Screening', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Interruption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Middle Insomnia', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropeptides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Reproduction', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Study models', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'age related', 'behavioral study', 'circadian pacemaker', 'cost', 'developmental genetics', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurobehavioral', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sleep regulation', 'software development', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2018,44524,-2.6771819819015947e-06
"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,9504168,K99NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2018,90050,0.002259862034992947
"Innovative text-mining tools to accelerate citation screening: comparative efficiency and impact on conclusions Project Summary Systematic reviews (SRs) synthesize and critically assess bodies of evidence to produce a comprehensive unbiased assessment of what is known. As such, SRs are vital for evidence-based decision-making. However, given the pace of new research, the process of developing an SR remains too slow. One particularly time-consuming step in the process is citation screening, which requires manual review of thousands of abstracts to identify only a small number of relevant studies. Screening such large numbers of studies is necessary because systematic reviewers place a high priority on identifying all relevant studies to avoid bias. Innovative citation screening tools, which utilize text-mining and new sophisticated machine learning methods, represent one potential solution. Abstrackr (Brown University) and EPPI-Reviewer (University College London) are off- the-shelf, web-based citation screening tools designed to improve screening efficiency. Both programs utilize machine- learning techniques to semi-automate the screening process by modeling the probability that each citation will meet criteria for inclusion. This allows efficiency gains through screening prioritization and screening truncation. With screening prioritization, citations are organized for screening from highest to lowest likelihood of inclusion. This allows earlier retrieval of full-text articles and facilitates workflow planning. Organizing citations by likelihood of inclusion also allows reviewers the option of truncating the screening process when remaining citations fall below a certain threshold. While promising, existing studies have predominantly been performed by computer scientists testing individual tools or comparing different modeling algorithms (e.g., various classifiers). To date, no studies have performed a direct comparison of citation screening tools. Similarly, although automatically excluding citations that fall below particular thresholds could substantively improve efficiency, adoption has been low due to concerns that relevant studies could be missed. However, how often studies would be missed and how important such omissions would be remains unknown. To address these knowledge gaps, this project will (1) Compare screening efficiency for two citation-screening tools, Abstrackr and EPPI-reviewer, and (2) Characterize the potential impact of using thresholds to exclude low probability studies automatically. To address aim 1, using citations from 3 large and 6 small completed evidence reports, we will compare Abstrackr to EPPI-Reviewer for citation screening. Using screening prioritization, we will assess what proportion of articles must be screened to identify all included studies (e.g., to achieve 100% sensitivity). For Aim 2, we will explore the potential impact of excluding all citations that fall below particular thresholds during the screening process. We will also assess to what extent missing these studies would alter report conclusions. By characterizing potential efficiency gains from new, innovative, and widely accessible tools, this project can facilitate wider adoption by evidence based practice centers seeking to speed systematic review production. Project Narrative Systematic reviews provide a comprehensive, unbiased assessment of a body of literature and are vital for timely, evidence-based decision-making. However, development of systematic reviews remains too slow, with one particularly time-consuming step being citation screening, in which thousands of research abstracts are manually reviewed to identify a small number of relevant studies. By testing potential gains in citation screening efficiency offered by two innovative, widely-accessible machine- learning tools (Abstrackr and EPPI–Reviewer), and determining if automatically excluding studies to improve speed compromises report conclusions, we hope to enable more rapid production of systematic reviews to inform clinicians and policy-makers and promote high quality, evidence-based patient care.",Innovative text-mining tools to accelerate citation screening: comparative efficiency and impact on conclusions,9435231,R03HS025859,[' '],AHRQ,ECRI INSTITUTE,R03,2018,95324,-0.038262105579154444
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9521378,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Politics', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adult obesity', 'big biomedical data', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'lower income families', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",K01,2018,155914,0.021202085527598436
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9427988,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2018,162800,-0.02653899231752518
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team. Through this career development plan, Dr. Shah will build upon her prior training in clinical cardiology and research methodology and lay a strong foundation for a high impact research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Atrial fibrillation affects six million US adults, and the prevalence is expected to double by 2030. As new drug and device treatments for stroke prevention emerge, patients and providers increasingly need accurate methods to monitor and improve patient safety.",Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification,9460286,K08HL136850,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulants', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vital Status', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'aging population', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'effectiveness research', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'stroke risk', 'stroke treatment', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2018,163080,-0.011718653591562602
"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9544317,K01MH106710,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Surveys', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric epidemiology', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Self-Administered', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stressful Event', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'salivary assay', 'secondary analysis', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),K01,2018,164330,-0.00343950835771476

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9537252,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,178606,0.02036707161011284
"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values. This work aims to improve our ability to extract useful information from electronic health records to enable disease subtyping, particularly in the area of mental health.",Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records,9566983,K01LM012529,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatology', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'response', 'treatment response']",NLM,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,187483,0.016675577347460776
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. In carrying out the research outlined in the following proposal, we plan to develop and apply machine learning methods to better identify subpopulations of individuals who have similar forms of COPD, potentially enabling better, targeted therapies.",Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD,9480874,K25HL130637,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cachexia', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Mass', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Scheme', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career development', 'cigarette smoke', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'flexibility', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'particle', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K25,2018,187699,-0.06120475283458491
"Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment SUMMARY Detecting the first and earliest stages of cognitive decline, conceptualized as “mild cognitive impairment” (MCI), has become increasingly important in recent years, as research focuses on delaying the manifestations of more severe stages of decline. It is now well recognized that changes in performance on cognitive tests begin up to ten years (or longer) before clinically apparent symptoms of dementia or functional impairment appear. Conventional assessment methods for assessing cognition Conventional assessment methods typically use the spoken response modality in which subjects are asked to verbally respond to prompts, and examiners carefully listen to these responses and apply test manuals to compute scores. These assessment methods require trained specialists and can be burdensome because they need to performed in clinics, especially so with frequent reassessment. Automating the scoring of assessment is important, not only for alleviating this burden but also for enabling large-scale studies on new intervention methods. Our research goal is to automate detection of MCI by developing, applying, and evaluating a system for automation of verbal (i.e., using spoken responses) cognitive-test scoring. Focusing on four verbal cognitive tests, we develop an extensible system comprising ASR and machine-learning algorithms to automatically score responses, and measure the efficacy of our proposed method by validating the accuracy of the automatically obtained scores against gold-standard, clinically obtained scores (Aim 1). Next, we develop classification methods for detecting individuals with MCI based on all information available in the verbal responses, and validating this classification against gold-standard clinical consensus. NARRATIVE Early detection of mild cognitive disease (MCI) is significantly important to delay more severe stages of cognitive decline. Conventional assessment methods require trained specialists and can be financially beyond the reach of most. We propose a tool for automatically scoring verbal cognitive tests. The proposed tool can be embedded in electronic devices providing the opportunity to assess large number of people in their homes, enabling clinicians to focus on those who are most at risk of cognitive decline.",Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment,9531223,R21AG055749,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Automation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Vascular Cognitive Impairment', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'response', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,187784,-0.032424084654984586
"Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes ABSTRACT Patterns (e.g. frequency, amount, etc.) of dietary intake and daily physical activity have each been independently linked with an increasing prevalence of obesity. Yet, connecting these patterns to obesity and chronic disease through the integration of time has not been previously considered. Given the strong evidence for independent linkages between each of these patterns and obesity, there is a critical need to determine the potential synergistic correlation of these patterns of behavior within the framework of a relationship with health. In the absence of such insights, opportunities for early detection of behavioral patterns that predispose obesity and chronic disease will be missed, and our long-term research goal to create these early detection strategies will not be met. The central hypothesis of this project is based on the analytical framework and methodology that was previously developed by the investigators: that daily patterns of energy intake, when integrated with physical activity, will be associated with health in a representative sample of U.S. adults 20 to 65 y (NHANES 2003-2006). The objectives in this R21 application include the development of data patterning methodology that can be used to create distinct dietary intake and physical activity patterns and then successfully integrate these patterns to identify population temporal pattern clusters. Next, the investigators will evaluate the cluster relationships with obesity and health outcomes and compare the integrated clusters to the un-integrated dietary and activity pattern clusters. The working hypotheses are firstly, that novel distance measures based on dynamic time warping for the dietary and physical activity data can be integrated to produce meaningful clustering related to health, and secondly, that a population cluster which exhibits a pattern of evenly spaced eating occasions, moderate energy consumption and moderate physical activity patterns in a 24 hour day will be associated with normal weight and without chronic disease, and that relationships with health outcomes will be stronger for the integrated temporal pattern clusters compared with un-integrated temporal dietary clusters and physical activity clusters. The rationale for this research is that its successful completion is expected to create data reduction methods that classify temporal lifestyle patterns linked to disease, further, the expectation is that these analytical techniques will integrate multidimensional temporal dietary and physical activity data. These outcomes are expected to have a significant positive impact, not only in developing/evaluating new analytic methods but in laying the groundwork for data based preventative interventions. This proposed research is potentially significant because results will provide a starting point for understanding the importance of the timing of dietary and physical activity patterns to the prevention of obesity and disease with potentially broad translational  RELEVANCE TO NIH The proposed research is relevant to public health because preventative time-based dietary and physical activity patterns will be identified among the US population, which are expected to open new research horizons for evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because individualized early detection of lifestyles supporting health or linked with disease may be attainable through the development of analytical techniques integrating multiple layers of data. Such strategies could be applied to utilize the increasing information from personal electronic monitoring devices and to detect patterns associated with positive and negative health outcomes.",Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes,9601212,R21CA224764,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Energy Intake', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moderate Exercise', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'expectation', 'health data', 'healthy lifestyle', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'modifiable behavior', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'prevent', 'speech processing', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'waist circumference']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,195600,-0.003734251348853303
"Integrative Learning to Combine Evidence for Personalized Treatment Strategies. Project Summary:  Mental disorders represent immense healthcare burdens. Intense efforts and resources have been devoted to developing pharmacological and behavioral treatments for mental disorders, but no universally effective treatments are available. Considerable heterogeneity exists in treatment response among individuals with mental disorders, in part because an individual patient's psychosocial characteristics and/or biomarkers are not accounted for when selecting among available treatment options. Barriers to implement personalized treatments in clinical psychiatry include a lack of evidence-based, clinically interpretable, individualized treatment rules (ITRs), a lack of power to detect treatment modiﬁers from a single study, and a lack of reproducibility for treatment rules estimated from single studies. We propose analytic solutions to tackle these barriers. Speciﬁcally, we will provide integrative machine learning methods to build powerful, yet interpretable, individualized treatment strategies that can be easily applied in clinical practice. We will integrate evidence of ITRs identiﬁed in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to increase robustness and reproducibility. In Aim 1, we will provide piece-wise linear decision trees that are trans- parent, interpretable, and that have guaranteed performance. Our decision trees will simultaneously identify the optimal treatment for a given patient (qualitative interaction) and subgroups of patients with large beneﬁt (quan- titative interaction). In Aim 2, we propose a novel integrative analysis to synthesize evidence across trials and provide an integrative ITR that improves efﬁciency and reproducibility. Our method does not require all studies to collect common sets of variables and thus allows evidence to be combined from ITRs identiﬁed in recent RCTs that collected emerging biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging measures) with earlier RCTs that focused on clinical and be- havioral markers. In response to the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to center mental health research around “dimensional psychological constructs” shared across disorders, the methods will be applied to a wide range of RCTs that recruited patients with major depressive disorder and other co-morbid mental disorders. This strategy allows examination of ITRs for constructs shared across disorders and will increase generalizability. We will apply our methods to various RCTs, including data available from the Na- tional Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness. This research will bridge approaches for personalized medicine and integrative analysis in an effort to better understand the complex interplay between biomarkers and clinical manifestations in the context of selecting the best treatments for patients with mental disorders. Project Narrative:  Treatment responses for mental disorders are inadequate and considerable heterogeneity is observed, in part because an individual patient's clinical, psychosocial, and/or biological markers are not accounted for when select- ing treatments among available options.

"Real-time Monitoring of Zebrafish ECG with Automated Aberrant Pattern Detection Abstract Sensoriis, Inc is a company that, develops evidence-based sensing solutions to support biological investigations and address health care problems. The goal of this NIH STTR grant with University of Washington (UW) is to provide a flexible system to assess cardiac electrical activities in zebrafish models, supporting heart disease studies and drug screening. Unlike humans, zebrafish hearts can fully regenerate following cardiac injury, thereby providing a tractable model system to study endogenous heart regeneration. Zebrafish have also proven to be an ideal vertebrate model system for phenotype-based screening owing to their physiological similarity to mammals. Further, zebrafish model enables a forward genetic approach to reveal the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of numerous heart diseases. The conventional setup for cardiac phenotype acquisition in zebrafish (i.e. electrocardiogram – ECG) involves sedation causing variation in functionality. To date, there is no system which can offer cardiac phenotype monitoring in freely-swimming zebrafish, not to mention for multiple fish simultaneously. In this context, we propose and develop 1) a wireless flexible “jacket” to be worn by zebrafish for real-time assessment of electrical cardiac phenotypes, namely ECG; and 2) a simple-yet-novel apparatus to collect ECG of multiple awake fish. Our devices provide pivotal platforms for cardiac phenotype-related investigations. The obtained data will be processed by smart algorithms to detect aberrant ECG patterns in real time. The proposed systems will facilitate related studies using zebrafish models. Further, the success of this platform also paves the avenue for regenerative medicine and developmental biology studies as well as stem cell-based therapies for cardiac repair. In Phase I of this STTR grant, we will develop i) a polymer-based microelectrode array (MEA) jacket that could be comfortably worn by the zebrafish and provide wireless ECG acquisition; and ii) a 4-chamber apparatus for simultaneous recording of ECG in awake fish. Machine learning-based programs with embedded algorithms will be developed to distinguish ECG patterns such as heart rate, ST and QT intervals, thus can identify anomalies, such as arrhythmias or prolonged QTs. For proof of concept, the system will be validated and compared. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this Phase I STTR grant, Sensoriis, Inc and the University of Washington will develop 1) a world-first wireless flexible membrane for zebrafish with a micro-electrode array (MEA) for ECG measurement and electronics for wireless powering and communication with an external unit; 2) a simple-yet-novel 4-chamber apparatus to acquire ECG of 4 awake fish; and 3) Machine learning-based programs to process the data and detect desired patterns. The goal is to facilitate and reduce cost and time of cardiac phenotype-based screening in the zebrafish models, supporting numerous studies.

"An integrated neural network analysis and video microscopy platform for fully automated particle tracking Project Summary/Abstract  Particle tracking (PT) is a biophysical tool for elucidating molecular interactions, transport phenomena of diverse species, and rheological properties of complex materials. PT experiments involve first obtaining high resolution videos that capture time-resolved increments of particles, followed by extraction of traces of entities of interest from videos in the form of spatial locations over time, a process we refer to as path conversion. Finally, quantitative analysis of the traces will yield diffusivities, viscoelasticity, etc.  Lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and COPD, are characterized by a highly viscoelastic mucus layer that is incapable of being cleared by mucociliary clearance. Not surprisingly, the viscoelasticity of mucus often directly reflects disease progression. A variety of mucolytics are being investigated, but due to the variable composition and properties of mucus between patients, effective mucolytics treatment will likely be different between individuals; too little/inappropriate mucolytics will not be effective in restoring mucus clearance, whereas too much may result in bronchorrhea. Although microbeads-based rheology has been performed on a variety of mucus specimens in basic research, the capacity for high throughput characterization of rheological properties of biological specimens in a clinical setting is currently not available. This limitation can be attributed to inefficiencies of path conversion: current PT software requires extensive human supervision/intervention to achieve accurate path conversion, not only resulting in poor reproducibility and throughput but also restricting its use to only expert labs. Our vision is to make PT as objective and easy to use as a simple plate reader that can be readily utilized by clinicians (diagnostics, disease progression, therapy effectiveness), pharma (preclinical/clinical drug screening), and research professionals. Towards this goal, we have created a neural network tracker (NNT) that automatically determines the location of all particles in each frame with zero user-input (i.e. no parameter for users to change), and retains the identity of all particles from frame to frame. The innovation is that NNT can robustly, reproducibly, and accurately track a wide range of 2D/3D videos with virtually no need for human intervention, achieving unparalleled time savings. We have already successfully deployed NNT over the Google cloud, which offers exceptional scalability. Nevertheless, for time-sensitive applications, such as an automated PT rheometer, the transfer of large video data files is likely prohibitive. Therefore, in this Phase I STTR, we seek to enable real-time NNT-based PT analysis on the local machine while video microscopy data is being acquired by the microscope, and allow data from PT analysis to drive the operation of the microscope. In Aim 1, we will integrate our NNT with a single objective fluorescence microscope system called Monoptes. Aim 2 will evaluate the performance of our NNT- Monoptes system. If successful, our technology would form the basis of a fully automated PT system capable of measuring rheological properties of fluids/materials or distribution of particle sizes in a 96-well plate format. Project Narrative Particle tracking is a powerful biophysical tool in life and physical sciences, but unfortunately, its application has been strongly limited by inefficiencies in accurately extracting particle traces from raw movies. Unlike conventional particle tracking methods, we have combined artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a software that can consistently provide superior and truly automated tracking performance compared to current alternatives. In this proposal, we will integrate this latest advance with sophisticated instrumentation to develop a microscope system capable of fully automated particle tracking microscopy in a 96-well plate format.

"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will test if it is possible to objectively characterize epileptic phenotypes in mice using a breakthrough technology involving machine learning-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of behavior. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to dramatically accelerate epilepsy research by enabling the objective, automated, inexpensive phenotyping of experimental animals to aid the testing of novel anticonvulsant therapies.",Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy,9503816,R21NS102908,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Knockout Mice', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Sodium Channel', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cost', 'dravet syndrome', 'evidence base', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'voltage']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,237423,-0.013194149434733403
"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data. This pioneering research directly impacts public health by improving the quality of care through enhanced reminder functionality in the EHRs.",A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications,9406887,R00LM011575,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Area', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Institution', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'open source', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R00,2018,248969,0.017711228034545452
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder.

"Auto-Scope Software-Automated Otoscopy to Diagnose Ear Pathology ABSTRACT Acute infections of the middle ear (acute otitis media - AOM), are the most commonly treated childhood disease. Treatment is fueled by concern for complications and effects on children's cognitive and language development. The financial burden of AOM is estimated at more than $5 billion per year. Because AOM is so common, a major societal problem is the over-diagnosis and over-treatment of this disease, as a result of two factors: First, accurately diagnosing AOM is difficult, even for experienced primary care or ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physicians. Second, with a growing shortage of primary care physicians in the US, more Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants serve as first-line clinicians in primary care settings, but lack extensive training in otoscopy (i.e. clinical examination of the eardrum). Consequently, practitioners often err on the side of making a diagnosis of AOM and prescribing oral antibiotics. Over 8 million unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed annually, contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and creating the largest number of pediatric medication-related adverse events. Many children with inaccurate diagnoses of AOM are referred to ENTs for surgical placement of ear tubes, and up to 70% of these cases are not indicated. Diagnosing AOM still depends on clinician subjectivity, based on a brief glimpse of the eardrum. This diagnostic subjectivity creates a critical barrier to progress in society's goal of decreasing healthcare costs and reducing over-diagnosis and over-treatment of AOM. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2013, devices are needed to assist in more accurate, consistent, and objective diagnosis of AOM. A simple and objective method of analyzing an image of a patient's ear to diagnose or rule out AOM would drastically reduce over-treatment. This project will fill that gap, by developing computer-assisted image analysis (CAIA) software that provides objective information to a clinician by analyzing eardrum images collected using currently available hardware. Based on previous work in applying similar methods to improve clinician performance in radiology and surgical pathology, our overarching hypothesis is that the incremental implementation of enhanced images, automated identification of abnormalities, and retrieval of similar cases will result in improved clinician diagnostic accuracy. In our preliminary work, we developed software, called Auto-Scope, which labels eardrums as “normal” versus “abnormal.” In this study, we propose two Specific Aims to improve diagnostic performance: Specific Aim #1: Create an enhanced composite image of the eardrum. Specific Aim #2: Use machine learning approaches for clinical decision support. The proposed research is relevant to public health because we are generating new methods aimed at improving diagnostic quality and reducing inter-observer variability, which will ultimately enable more accurate diagnosis and personalized therapeutic approaches for ear abnormalities. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission pertaining to the application of novel strategies that may improve human health, and NIDCD's mission of improving diagnosis and treatment of ear diseases, particularly otitis media.",Auto-Scope Software-Automated Otoscopy to Diagnose Ear Pathology,9669491,R21DC016972,"['Academy', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesteatoma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Cyst', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Ear Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hair', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nose', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otolaryngologist', 'Otoscopes', 'Otoscopy', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physician Assistants', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Side', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Tympanic membrane', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'acute infection', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cognitive development', 'computerized', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'digital video recording', 'effusion', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'middle ear', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overtreatment', 'personalized therapeutic', 'primary care setting', 'prototype', 'software development']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,252169,-0.018760057136935192
"QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring Modern health monitoring devices at hospitals and wearable sensors in households generate a large amount of time series data at high rate, capturing the physiological status of patients in a real-lime fashion. The premise is that these technology advances enable a data-driven healthcare system that starts making fast, accurate, objective and inexpensive decisions based upon data, in addition to an individual physician's experience and preference. However, there is a significant gap in the mathematical theory and computational tools to promptly extract actionable information from multi-modal non-stationary time series data in a robust and tractable manner, which has become a serious roadblock to further utilize bigger data for better healthcare monitoring. The goal of this research program is to develop a mathematical framework for extracting time-frequency and geometric representations of multi-modal physiological data, in an online and robust manner, and use them to design machine learning algorithms to improve real-lime health monitoring. Specifically, we hypothesize that the development of time-series and geometric methods for large streaming multi-modal monitoring data will lead to more accurate diagnosis on various physiological monitoring applications, including detection and prediction of rare events such as seizure and arrhythmia, classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, and real-time artifact removal of physiological data. To achieve our goal, we plan to develop novel theoretical and computational tools for analyzing non-stationary multi-modal time series data with noise, corruption and missing data as well as real-time algorithms for filtering and event detection from such data. The tools and algorithms will be applied on clinical tasks at the Nationwide Children's Hospital. In addition, the real-time workflow will be implemented on Hadoop clusters with a mission of public sharing of both data and software. The development from the interdisciplinary team composed of mathematicians, biomedical informaticians as well as the hospital will not only transform the frontiers of mathematics knowledge, but also significantly impact clinical applications, data science education, and the development of the $11 O billion emerging market of wireless health. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel computational theory and software to extract physiological information from the large multi-modal data streams generated by modern health monitoring devices.

"Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Individual sleep disorders and characteristics are known to be associated with adverse health outcomes. However, few studies consider sleep in a multivariate context. Therefore, we propose a paradigmatic shift in sleep research towards sleep health. Conducting research through a sleep health lens can change health practice by clarifying which sleep characteristics are most important to treat, enhancing screening efforts, and facilitating the generalization of findings to all individuals, not just those with specific sleep disorders or complaints. Before achieving these long-term goals, however, the crucial first steps in the study of sleep health are to determine which sleep profiles predict health outcomes (Aim 1), and develop predictive algorithms that can identify individuals at risk of adverse health outcomes based on their sleep and other risk factors (Aim 2). These aims can only be achieved with an awareness of the statistical challenges related to the inherent multidimensionality of sleep health (e.g. multiple domains of sleep, multiple characteristics to represent each domain, multiple data sources, etc.). This multidimensionality generates substantial methodological barriers regarding variable and model selection and threatens researchers' abilities to develop transparent and reproducible models. In this R01, investigators will apply rigorous, sophisticated statistical methods to a large aggregated sample of adults aged >60 with self-report and polysomnographic characterization and over 10 years of longitudinal follow-up from three parent studies: Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Sleep Study (MrOS), Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). In Aim 1, investigators will determine which multidimensional sleep profiles predict time to mortality in older adults using Cox-proportional hazards models, tree-structured survival analysis, and clustering. In Aim 2, investigators will develop powerful machine learning algorithms that incorporate sleep and other risk factors to identify which older adults have the greatest risk for early mortality. Within each aim, the impact of sex and race will be rigorously investigated, and models will be internally validated in independent samples to ensure reproducibility. The Secondary Aim is to investigate generalizability to studies with different demographic profiles and sleep protocols (Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, Honolulu Asia Aging Study of Sleep America) and different data types (sleep diary, actigraphy). All models will be developed in the context of other important known risk factors, including but not limited to age, gender, race, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and BMI. Findings from Aim 1 will jumpstart subsequent mechanistic research focused on sleep-related causal factors of mortality, leading to identification of targeted treatments for sleep problems that could reduce risk of mortality and morbidity. Findings from Aim 2 will provide important preliminary evidence for enhanced screening tools that can more accurately identify which individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project initiates a paradigmatic research shift by studying multivariate sleep health in older adults. Cutting- edge statistical methods will be applied to a large, multi-cohort sample, and replicability of findings will be rigorously investigated. Achieving the proposed aims will improve health practice by: (1) determining which multivariate sleep profiles predict mortality in older adults, thereby jumpstarting subsequent mechanistic research on sleep-related causal factors of mortality and targeted treatments to reduce mortality; and (2) suggesting prediction algorithms that incorporate sleep to enhance health screening for adverse health outcomes in older adults.",Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods,9534484,R01AG056331,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Asia', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Vision', 'Wakefulness', 'Well in self', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'actigraphy', 'aged', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'diaries', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'health practice', 'improved', 'lens', 'men', 'mortality', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prediction algorithm', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sex', 'sleep health', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,298548,0.003640190643839921
"FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing The goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to demonstrate utility to all major pathogenic bacterial strains of SeLux’s rapid, low-cost, phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) system (fast-AST or FAST). Utilizing existing optical detectors and standard dried antibiotic microplates, and avoiding pitfalls of metabolic probes, FAST will potentially transform therapy of infections by significantly accelerating AST, thereby facilitating treatment with the optimal antibiotic. Aim 1 will apply FAST to hundreds of samples of pathogenic bacterial strains, while developing and optimizing a predictive algorithm for clinical utility. Aim 2 will extend the FAST platform to slow-growing strains and species as well. SeLux has demonstrated FAST to exceed FDA 510(k) requirements for minimum inhibitory concentration determinations for 25+ strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with full antibiotic panels. Completion of the proposed aims will expand FAST to all major clinically-relevant, non-fastidious bacterial pathogens. SeLux’s interdisciplinary team has expertise in nanosensing, microbiology, and algorithm design and is buttressed by distinguished experts in Clinical Microbiology, Infectious Disease, and Machine Learning. The new paradigm in clinical medicine is value-based healthcare, which requires rapid and accurate diagnoses leading to optimal patient treatment. Nowhere is this more important than in treating infections, where doctors are currently forced to overprescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics during an agonizing 48+ hour wait for antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) results. The novel, rapid, low-cost AST platform described in this proposal promises to reduce this delay in treatment by as much as 30 hours. This advance would be transformative for the treatment of infections because current over-use of broad-spectrum antibiotics not only harms individual patients but is a primary contributor to the growing epidemic of antibiotic resistance.","FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing",9464993,R43AI136125,"['Agreement', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amplifiers', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Biological Assay', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'End Point Assay', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Invaded', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Optics', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Quality of Care', 'Reagent', 'Recovery', 'Regulatory Affairs', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Vancomycin', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detector', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'nanosensors', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis']",NIAID,"SELUX DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2018,298851,-0.00863465372241055
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9476980,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,300000,0.014068092811552798
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9540043,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,304104,-0.0012640970268326431
"Statistical Methods in Trans-Omics Chronic Disease Research Project Summary The broad, long-term objectives of this research are the development of novel and high-impact statistical methods for medical studies of chronic diseases, with a focus on trans-omics precision medicine research. The speciﬁc aims of this competing renewal application include: (1) derivation of efﬁcient and robust statistics for integrative association analysis of multiple omics platforms (DNA sequences, RNA expressions, methylation proﬁles, protein expressions, metabolomics proﬁles, etc.) with arbitrary patterns of missing data and with detection limits for quantitative measurements; (2) exploration of statistical learning approaches for handling multiple types of high- dimensional omics variables with structural associations and with substantial missing data; and (3) construction of a multivariate regression model of the effects of somatic mutations on gene expressions in cancer tumors for discovery of subject-speciﬁc driver mutations, leveraging gene interaction network information and accounting for inter-tumor heterogeneity in mutational effects. All these aims have been motivated by the investigators' applied research experience in trans-omics studies of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The proposed solutions are based on likelihood and other sound statistical principles. The theoretical properties of the new statistical methods will be rigorously investigated through innovative use of advanced mathematical arguments. Computationally efﬁcient and numerically stable algorithms will be developed to implement the inference procedures. The new methods will be evaluated extensively with simulation studies that mimic real data and applied to several ongoing trans-omics precision medicine projects, most of which are carried out at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Their scientiﬁc merit and computational feasibility are demonstrated by preliminary simulation results and real examples. Efﬁcient, reliable, and user-friendly open-source software with detailed documentation will be produced and disseminated to the broad scientiﬁc community.

"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements (DS) and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); our ability to readily identify interactions between DS with prescription medications is currently very limited. To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored. Our long-term goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate its findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support systems. The objective of this application is to develop an informatics framework to enable the discovery of DSIs by creating a DS terminology and mining scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. Towards these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Compile a comprehensive DS terminology using online resources; and (2) Discover potential DSIs from the biomedical literature. The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel informatics paradigm and resources for identifying most clinically significant DSI signals and their biological mechanisms. This information is critical to subsequent efforts aimed at improving patient safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The results from this study are imperative in order to achieve the ultimate goal of reducing an individual’s risk of potential DSIs.

"A computational approach to early sepsis detection Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project, we propose to improve the performance of InSight, a machine-learning- based sepsis screening system, in situations of limited training data from the target clinical site. The proposed work will make possible prospective clinical deployments to sites which are smaller or lack clinical data repositories, by significantly reducing the amount of training data necessary down to a few weeks of clinical observation. Classically, a machine-learning-based system like InSight requires complete retraining for each new clinical setting, in turn requiring a new and large collection of data from each target deployment site. We will circumvent this requirement via transfer learning techniques, which transfer knowledge acquired previously in a source clinical setting to a new, target setting. Research Questions: Which transfer learning methods and paired classification algorithms are most suitable for use with InSight, requiring minimal target-site training data while maintaining strong performance? Are these methods and algorithms robust across the several common sepsis-spectrum definitions? Prior Work: We have developed InSight using the MIMIC-III retrospective data set, on which it attains an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88 for sepsis detection, and 0.74 for 4-hour early sepsis prediction. We have also conducted pilot transfer learning  ≥ experiments in a different clinical task, mortality forecasting, in which transfer learning yields a 10-fold reduction in the amount of target-site training data required to achieve AUROC 0.80. Specific Aims: Aim 1 - to implement and assess side-by-side four diverse transfer learning methods for a retrospective clinical sepsis prediction task, where the source data set is MIMIC-III and the simulated clinical target is a data set drawn from UCSF. Aim 2 - to determine which among the best methods from Aim 1 also provide robust performance when applied to two additional sepsis-spectrum gold standards. Methods: We will prepare implementations of transfer learning methods which use instance transfer, residual learning and/or feature augmentation, kernel length scale transfer, and feature transfer. We will test these methods with applicable classifiers on subsets of the UCSF set, using cross-validation and quantifying discrimination performance in terms of AUROC. The best method/classifier pairs will require no more than 30 examples of septic patients from the target set and attain AUROC superiorities of 0.05 in 0- and 4-hour pre-onset sepsis prediction/detection, relative to the best tested alternative screening systems (Aim 1). The top three pairs will then be tested for robustness to gold standard choice, using septic shock (0- and 4-hour) and SIRS-based sepsis (0-hour) gold standards; in these tests, at least one pair must again attain 0.05 margin of superiority in AUROC versus the alternative screening systems (Aim 2). Future Directions: The results of these experiments will enable InSight to be robustly deployed to diverse clinical sites, yielding high performance without the need for extensive target-site data acquisition. Narrative Clinical decision support (CDS) systems present critical information to medical professionals by examining patient data and providing relevant information. Machine learning is a powerful method for creating CDS tools, but accessing its full strength requires re-training with retrospective data from each target clinical site. We will use transfer learning techniques to dramatically reduce the amount of target-site training data required by InSight, our machine-learning-based CDS tool for sepsis prediction, and empirically evaluate several such methods on a patient data set, using three different sepsis-related gold standards.",A computational approach to early sepsis detection,9557664,R43TR002221,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Collection', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Discrimination', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'performance site', 'portability', 'prospective', 'screening', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'success', 'support tools']",NCATS,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,310782,-0.0002658098996454016
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,9579149,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,314000,-0.015003055904396705
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9511925,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,328340,0.0022010223718931356
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9406318,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,356625,-0.00033272829342562827
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems. The resulting symptom dimensions will allow better stratification of risk for clinically-important outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays and early readmissions.",Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology,9445485,R01MH106577,"['Admission activity', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Applaud', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical stratification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'health data', 'health record', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'natural language', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'readmission risk', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'trend']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,376490,0.013312702798089516
"Smartphone phenotype collection for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment Project Summary This project addresses a critical need for early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and other Alzheimer's-related dementias (ADRD). Advances in smartphone hardware, computer vision, and machine learning have enabled the possibility of producing smartphone-based cognitive testing applications able to collect electronic sensor data and transform it into highly informative phenotypes that can serve as early indicators of future disease progression. In this project, we aim to develop a revolutionary new smartphone- based cognitive testing platform, called CTX, that will enable the rapid development and deployment of smartphone-based tests that can capture raw sensor streams in a synchronized fashion, subsample and compress the combined streams, and transmit them to a cloud server for subsequent analysis and modeling. CTX will provide a high-level application development framework that will significantly reduce the time and technical knowledge required to produce a smartphone-based cognitive testing application by providing an application programming interface (API) that enables developers to simply declare what sensor data should be collected and when. The framework will handle all the details of collecting the sensor data, synchronizing it, and transmitting it to a back-end server. The API will also have a variety of other high-level features to facilitate development of cognitive test apps. To demonstrate the feasibility of our vision for CTX, in Aim 1 of this project we will develop the software framework, back-end server software and a prototype smartphone app to exercise and validate many of the platform's features. For Aim 2, we will develop three different tests for this app to test saccade (eye movement) latency, verbal recall, and wrist mobility, each collecting a different type of sensor data (video, audio, and inertial measurement). These tests were selected because their results have been been shown to be predictive of MCI. We will implement phenotype extraction pipelines that employ advanced signal processing, machine learning, and computer vision algorithms to extract the target phenotypes from the sensor data collected for these tests and demonstrate they operate with sufficient accuracy to replicate published experimental designs. Successful completion of this project will eliminate the need for expensive and cumbersome phenotype collection equipment (e.g., eye tracking stations) and create the possibility of generating data from which MCI onset can be predicted. Data collected in Phase II via these and other such tests will enable us to apply our machine learning expertise to produce models able to predict transition to MCI that are both sensitive and specific, transforming any smartphone into an MCI risk assessment tool available for at-home use by millions of people. Project Narrative This NIH Phase I project will address the critical need for early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-related dementias (ADRD) by developing a revolutionary new smartphone-based cognitive testing platform that will provide individuals with an ongoing status of their cognitive health. Doctors who are given access to the results of these tests will be able to monitor patients more closely and provide more timely diagnoses.

"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9472335,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,418408,-0.003149710853832814
"Assess and Model the Health Effects, Population, and Infrastructural Vulnerabilities of Power Outage PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Climate change will lead to more intense and longer-lasting extreme weather events, such as floods, hurricanes, and severe storms, which will lead to more frequent power outage (PO). Significant gaps remain in our understanding of the impact of PO on human health: most previous studies were based on self-reported survey data, which is subject to reporting bias. In addition to weather factors that directly affect human health, other concurrent factors such as PO may also mediate with extreme weather on health, for which research is also lacking. Few studies assessed both power infrastructures and population vulnerabilities, and compared the effects of different PO causes. Furthermore, no health prediction models have been developed for PO. To fill these knowledge gaps, the proposed study will build upon multiple ongoing/ completed studies to: 1) assess the effects and mediating pathways of PO on electricity-dependent health outcomes, co-morbidities, and nursing home transfers; 2) identify infrastructure, environmental, and population vulnerabilities (individual and community); and 3) develop a vulnerability index and prediction model. We will effectively link the accessible New York statewide hospital admission and emergency department (ED) visit data with the existing data on PO, weather, air pollution, census, and nursing home transfer data. The associations between PO causes, frequency, duration, or area coverage of PO and electricity-dependent hospitalizations or ED visits due to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dialysis, water-/food-borne diseases, injury, and carbon monoxide poisoning will be assessed through Bayesian spatial-temporal model. This advanced technique will be able to control for both socio-demographic differences by regions and multiple temporal variables simultaneously. To improve scientific rigor, we will use control days (without PO and extreme weather) to separate PO from weather effects, and control diseases (e.g. appendicitis) to examine temporal changes of disease reporting. To understand PO’s natural direct and indirect effects, causal mediation analysis will be used. Furthermore, new variable selection methods, including Sure Independence Screening and Generalized Additive Model Selection will be used to screen and select predictors highly associated with outcomes. A composite vulnerability index weighed by risk factors identified and vulnerability maps will be developed. We will establish PO and PO-related health predictive models using the state-of-the-art data mining techniques, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Tree, and Ensemble Learning Decision Tree model. The excellent team with multidisciplinary and experienced investigators, numerous already collected and geocoded datasets, innovative data mining and analysis methods, continuation of student training, and successful prior partnerships with government agencies will maximize the probability of our success and feasibility. This project will also significantly enhance our institute’s environment and students’ involvement in research, and our findings will identify evidence-based strategies for emergency management and public health preparedness. NARRATIVE The proposed study will evaluate whether frequency, duration, coverage, and certain causes of power outage (PO) are associated with increased risks of electricity-dependent diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dialysis, water-/food-borne diseases, injury, and carbon monoxide poisoning. This may be the first study to assess whether people with certain demographic characteristics (e.g. elderly or different sex), living in a neighborhood with certain vulnerabilities (e.g. high land coverage or low hospital density), in certain seasons, degree of urbanicity, or specific causes of PO are more vulnerable to the impact of PO. The findings, vulnerability index and maps, and the forecast models derived from this study will help guide the state or federal environmental and health agencies to plan interventions and climate adaptation programs.","Assess and Model the Health Effects, Population, and Infrastructural Vulnerabilities of Power Outage",9440510,R15ES028000,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Appendicitis', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Carbon Monoxide Poisoning', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Climate', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electricity', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Equipment Failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Floods', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Geographic Factor', 'Government Agencies', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hurricane', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neighborhoods', 'New York', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Trees', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'climate change', 'climate impact', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder control', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'extreme heat', 'foodborne', 'forest', 'health data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'member', 'modifiable risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'screening', 'sex', 'student training', 'success']",NIEHS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT ALBANY,R15,2018,443750,-0.06575556239470537
"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II Project Summary Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Clinical performance assessment emphasizes learner evaluation over learner development, lacks rigor and utility for developmental purposes, and clinical teachers have expressed particular difficulty with diagnosing reasoning deficits for remediation purposes. Further, medical students' diagnostic reasoning does not improve over the course of clinical training and senior medical students have highly variable diagnostic performance that is often rated below expectations according to theory-based and validated scoring criteria. Independent practice does not necessarily enhance the context for clinical reasoning; the majority of physicians' medical errors are thought to be diagnostic in nature. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Improve reliability of human scoring of DXJ essays. 2) Extend the automated scoring algorithms. 3) Automated reasoning failure categorization and remediation. 4) Complete the software development required for delivering the commercial product. 5) Evaluate predictive validity of automatically scored DXJ essays. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine. Project Narrative Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.","Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II",9537633,R42GM108104,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Case Based Learning', 'Case Study', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Competence', 'Community Health Education', 'Competence', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Incubators', 'Instruction', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Role', 'Sales', 'Schedule', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Teaching Method', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'educational atmosphere', 'essays', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'prototype', 'remediation', 'research and development', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'software development', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'undergraduate medical education', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"PARALLEL CONSULTING, LLC",R42,2018,489952,0.0059174733968471475
"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions Project Summary/Abstract People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases users’ independence by responding to them without another person’s intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the user’s position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the user’s body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale. Project Narrative People who are essentially quadriplegic, with significant mobility impairments and limited to no upper extremity use, are dependent on others to maintain proper positioning for access to devices essential for their health, mobility and communication, such as eye gaze speech devices, call systems, phones, tablets, wheelchair controls, and hydration and suctioning tubes. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision to detect specific targets, such as facial features, to control a robotic mounting and positioning system; automatically repositioning devices for best access without assistance from others, even when their position changes. This technology enables continuous access to communication, maintains one’s ability to drive a wheelchair and allows a person to drink or suction themselves, providing good hydration, respiratory health and hygiene.",Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions,9644103,R44HD093467,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Hydration status', 'Hygiene', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lighting', 'Logic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Research Design', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Saliva', 'Self Care', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spastic Tetraplegia', 'Speech', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Suction', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tube', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Variant', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'body system', 'commercialization', 'communication device', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'manufacturability', 'meetings', 'product development', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'research and development', 'respiratory health', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"BLUE SKY DESIGNS, INC.",R44,2018,519349,-0.037918887377388404
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,9522037,R01GM097618,"['Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Coxibs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'synergism']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,536041,-0.011385743143133892
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data.

"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,9612862,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,547853,-0.005727284004059976
"Characterizing Alzheimer's Disease with INSPECDS: Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT  It is estimated that Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), Fronto-temporal dementia and Vascular dementia. Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for Alzheimer's disease, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage day and night assessment technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) to profile Alzheimer's and other dementias. The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be the Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), the Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated intially for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea but has more recently been applied to assess Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The AMP is unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks and has proven effective in characterizing cognitive decline in Alzheimer's. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real- time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits in Alzheimer's and other dementias. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies with submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements to quantify the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine- learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to finalize implementation of a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud- based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of Alzheimer's and other dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, clinical course, and treatment options for Alzheimer's and other neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need, Advanced Brain Monitoring (Carlsbad, CA) is developing Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profilers for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS), which will provide an inexpensive, non-invasive solution combining neurocognitive, electrophysiological (EEG, ECG, EMG), and sleep-behavior assessment into a single, integrated system featuring automated scoring and classification algorithms. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical tool of its kind and find immediate application in clinical settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of Alzheimer's and other dementia patients.",Characterizing Alzheimer's Disease with INSPECDS: Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes,9524766,R44AG054256,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Depressed mood', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Industry', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Head Movements', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Minor', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Process', 'REM Sleep Behavior Disorder', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stratification', 'Stroke', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Wireless Technology', 'alertness', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cloud based', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'data acquisition', 'data warehouse', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'genetic association', 'human subject', 'limb movement', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurocognitive test', 'relating to nervous system', 'synucleinopathy', 'tool']",NIA,"ADVANCED BRAIN MONITORING, INC.",R44,2018,548140,-0.052196369520942656
"Machine learning for data-driven subtyping of major depression Major depressive disorder is highly prevalent, and represents a major driver of disability as well as health care cost. Progress in improving diagnosis and treatment of this disorder has been hindered by its heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course. Such heterogeneity makes the underlying neurobiology difficult to characterize, and has led to efforts to identify more homogeneous subgroups. These efforts date back to the dawn of the modern psychopharmacologic era - initially focused on atypical and melancholic depression, and more recently on subtypes such as anxious and irritable depression.  Subtyping efforts are complicated by a paucity of large clinical cohorts with similar ascertainment and phenotyping. In particular, the available data often focuses on a very narrow range of depressive symptoms, along with a restricted set of comorbidities, and typically encompasses only the acute phase of treatment. As a result, despite intriguing findings in one or occasionally two cohorts, subtyping has not been widely deployed in clinical practice, nor used to meaningfully improve translational investigation.  The utility of electronic health records and registries to create in silico cohort studies has been demonstrated in numerous settings, including psychiatry. Beyond sample size and efficiency of ascertainment, these data types often have advantages in the range of non-depressive phenotypes captured and availability of longitudinal data.  The present study therefore proposes to create a very large cohort of individuals with MDD, defined by a validated algorithm, spanning two health systems, and to apply novel machine learning methods to identify MDD subtypes. These subtypes will be validated by comparison with standard phenotypic definitions, annotation by trained raters using a standard 'intruder' paradigm, and correlation with medication prescribing Then, as proof of concept the biological basis of these subtypes will be characterized by examining heritability and polygenic risk using a large genetic biobank. Beyond determining convergent validity, this last step will provide proof-of-concept for broader application of data-driven subtypes for translational investigation in biobanks and registries.  The study builds on existing collaborations between a team experienced in mood disorder phenotypic and genomic study as well as application of electronic health records, and a team active in developing and applying emerging methods in machine learning. It will lay the groundwork for further validation and application of data-driven disease subtyping across medicine. Public health significance The wide variation in symptoms of major depressive disorder complicates efforts to understand the underlying causes of this illness. Applying machine learning methods to electronic health records should enable the identification of more specific disease subgroups. These subgroups will facilitate efforts to understand the causes of depression, and to begin to develop more targeted treatments.",Machine learning for data-driven subtyping of major depression,9717620,R56MH115187,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety', 'Atypical depressive disorder', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endocrine System Diseases', 'European', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Melancholic Depression', 'Mental Depression', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reactive depression', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'psychopharmacologic', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R56,2018,595755,-0.008836026482894908
"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9593059,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,750000,0.0003399656103933519
"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9614825,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,826025,-0.003779022733642808
"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP).

"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility.

"An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics Project Summary Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper neurological development. During sleep, there is enhanced synaptic plasticity in the nervous system in addition to often extensive neural remodeling. Although we know that sleep regulation is important to neurological development, many aspects of sleep regulation are poorly understood. In particular, the mechanisms of how we compensate for missed sleep in future sleep cycles are mysterious, despite general knowledge of how circadian rhythms are established. It is likely that these mechanisms involve neuropeptide signaling in the brain. However, current tools to study the roles these peptides play in sleep homeostasis, even with the use of simple model organisms like C. elegans, are low- throughput, qualitative, and subjective. In order to study sleep-like behavior in C. elegans, there is an unmet need for a tool for continuously monitoring and perturbing long-term behavior of the worm, as well as an automated and un-biased method for quantifying behavioral data. In this proposal, we will first develop the enabling technology, and use it to identify the roles of neuropeptides in homeostasis of the nematode’s sleep- like state. In Aim I, we will engineer and validate a scalable microscopy platform for monitoring and perturbing C. elegans behavior, decreasing the cost of long-term candidate screens by ~ 100 fold. In Aim 2, we will quantify behavior of wild-type animals via an automated and bias-free quantitative analysis to establish baseline behavior and prioritize behaviors that are linked to sleep homeostasis. In Aim 3, we will use the technology developed in Aims I and 2 to quantify differences in behavior of C. elegans neuropeptide mutants using a candidate approach. Because of the strong preliminary data we have gathered so far and the experience of the sponsor’s laboratory, this proposed work is likely to identify the roles of these candidate neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis, contributing to our mechanistic understanding of sleep regulation. Furthermore, the tools we develop for this particular study will also have broad utilities in many other problems, such as developmental programming, aging, and neurobehavioral studies. Project Narrative Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper brain development and is linked to a variety of neurological and behavioral disorders. In particular, how animals correct for interrupted sleep cycles in future cycles could lead to therapeutic targets, but apart from a few implicated neuropeptides, little is known about the mechanisms behind this aspect of sleep. The objective of this proposal is to identify the roles of neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis by screening C. elegans mutants for behavioral defects.",An automated and massively scalable platform for organismal and developmental genetics,9396432,F31GM123662,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Interruption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Middle Insomnia', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropeptides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Reproduction', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Study models', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'age related', 'behavioral study', 'circadian pacemaker', 'cost', 'developmental genetics', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurobehavioral', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sleep regulation', 'software development', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2017,44044,-2.6771819819015947e-06
"Characterizing and Modeling Infants' Self-Generated Object Views: Implications for Object Recognition and Language Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human visual object recognition is foundational to many achievements—from object name learning to tool use to real world problem solving. Understanding the developmental processes that underlie visual object recognition is of critical importance because the individual differences that characterize early visual object recognition have clinical, educational, and societal implications. For instance, toddlers with poor visual object recognition skills are more likely to have below-average vocabulary sizes. Toddlers with smaller vocabularies have a greater likelihood of developing language impairments and are more likely to lag in pre-literacy and literacy skills. Deficits in visual object recognition and word learning have also been exhibited by individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ADSs). The overarching goal of the proposed project is to better understand the sensory-motor mechanisms that support visual object recognition. Considerable evidence suggests that active object manipulation relates to better visual object recognition, however little is known about the mechanisms through which object manipulation connects to visual object processing during development. The proposed research tests the hypothesis that one major route through which object manipulation matters is that it generates many different views of the same object, and that the variation within multiple visual instances of the same object facilitates visual object recognition by building more generalizable representations for recognizing unseen instances. This hypothesis is tested by (1) characterizing the properties of object information generated by infants during free play and by (2) evaluating the information in those generated visual streams by feeding them to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) – the first computational models of vision capable of human-like visual recognition. Two additional lines of research motivate the approach. First is evidence showing infants learn from statistical regularities in visual inputs presented briefly in a laboratory setting. Second is research using head-mounted cameras suggesting that object views generated by infant manipulation have unique properties, including views dominated by a single object. What we do not yet know are the visual statistics of the views infants generate in everyday toy play or their value for a statistical learner such as CNNs. The proposed research will address these gaps in the literature by characterizing the visual object inputs infants generate and how these inputs may facilitate visual object recognition. The proposed research will also determine how differences in visual inputs may be linked with individual differences in infant object name learning. This research will lead to a deeper understanding of the early development of visual object recognition, and may also provide a crucial missing link in our understanding of the developmental trajectory of other cognitive functions, including object name learning. Moreover, the knowledge to be gained from the proposed research has the potential to inform (1) individual differences in learning, (2) strategies for identifying learning delays, and (3) construction of interventions to remediate learning delays. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to characterize the nature of infants' early visual experiences of objects and their relation to object manipulation, language abilities, and computational models of object recognition. The period of development to be studied – 18 to 24 months – is a period in which delays in visual object recognition and in vocabulary learning have been connected to future development of language impairments and diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). The proposed research is highly relevant to public health as it will elucidate sources of individual differences in early object recognition and word learning, laying the foundation for aiding diagnosis of early language delay and ASDs, as well as the development of future object recognition and vocabulary/language intervention programs.",Characterizing and Modeling Infants' Self-Generated Object Views: Implications for Object Recognition and Language Learning,9395459,F32HD093280,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Parents', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Toy', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'feeding', 'intervention program', 'language impairment', 'literacy', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'vision development', 'visual object processing', 'word learning']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F32,2017,57066,-0.035099653125971846
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,9333122,U54EB020405,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'massive open online courses', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online resource', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reduce symptoms', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool', 'visiting scholar']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2017,68981,0.02111009090826029
"Multidimensional MRI-based Big Data Analytics to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder. In this project, we propose to develop a fully automatic image post-processing pipeline and multidimensional big data analyses based on machine learning techniques, with the aim to uncover latent information from complex dataset and with the ultimate goal of setting up a platform for OA precision medicine",Multidimensional MRI-based Big Data Analytics to Study Osteoarthritis,9385849,K99AR070902,"['Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'California', 'Cartilage', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Institutes', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'career development', 'cartilage degradation', 'connectome', 'data integration', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging scientist', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'kinematics', 'member', 'modifiable risk', 'morphometry', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'parallel processing', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'racial difference', 'repository', 'shape analysis', 'soft tissue', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K99,2017,94041,-0.041030485657975374
"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials.

"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9528113,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Politics', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'big biomedical data', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'lower income families', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",K01,2017,155914,0.021202085527598436
"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions Project Summary/Abstract People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases users’ independence by responding to them without another person’s intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the user’s position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the user’s body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale. Project Narrative People who are essentially quadriplegic, with significant mobility impairments and limited to no upper extremity use, are dependent on others to maintain proper positioning for access to devices essential for their health, mobility and communication, such as eye gaze speech devices, call systems, phones, tablets, wheelchair controls, and hydration and suctioning tubes. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision to detect specific targets, such as facial features, to control a robotic mounting and positioning system; automatically repositioning devices for best access without assistance from others, even when their position changes. This technology enables continuous access to communication, maintains one’s ability to drive a wheelchair and allows a person to drink or suction themselves, providing good hydration, respiratory health and hygiene.",Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions,9407137,R44HD093467,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Hydration status', 'Hygiene', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lighting', 'Logic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phonation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Research Design', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Saliva', 'Self Care', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spastic Tetraplegia', 'Speech', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Suction', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tube', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Variant', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'body system', 'commercialization', 'communication device', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'meetings', 'product development', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'research and development', 'respiratory health', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"BLUE SKY DESIGNS, INC.",R44,2017,159267,-0.037918887377388404
"Improving Cardiovascular Drug Safety With Automated Bleeding Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment often includes drug therapy with oral anticoagulants (OAC) to prevent stroke. Bleeding, however, is a common complication of these drugs, affecting up to one in four patients. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently prioritized OAC-related drug safety as a key quality measure. Currently, however, no method exists to accurately identify bleeding events and severity in large populations. Prior methods use diagnoses codes, which lack sensitivity and clinical detail, or manual chart review, which cannot be implemented in large populations. The proposed research aims address this knowledge gap by applying a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach to identify bleeding events and classify severity in a real-world AF population. The tools will be validated in patients treated at a different institution, to ensure reproducibility across provider settings. In addition, we will apply the bleeding classification tool to evaluate the association between bleeding severity and mortality. Dr. Shah is an emerging young investigator whose career development plan is focused on acquiring the biomedical informatics skills to needed to accurately identify and reduce patient harm. Her training plan focuses on learning core competencies in natural language processing, with the goal of turning the wealth of data in the electronic medical record into useable knowledge. She will combine mentorship from established experts and targeted coursework to acquire skills in biomedical informatics, data science, advanced analytic methods, and research leadership. Completion of these research and training aims will create a platform for future R01 proposals by: (i) enabling safety focused comparative effectiveness research in AF (ii) setting the stage to identify bleeding complications in other cardiovascular diseases and (iii) developing a skill set that allows leadership of a multidisciplinary research team.

"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9224405,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2017,163452,-0.02653899231752518
"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD. This effort has significant public health implications, as it can lead to new treatment targets and result in the accurate allocation of treatment resources to those most in need.","Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1",9321191,K01MH102415,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'CNR2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corticotropin', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'New York City', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Sociology', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional disability', 'genetic analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'pediatric trauma', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'response', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'social', 'stress resilience', 'traumatic event', 'urinary']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2017,165886,-0.002268787428576773
"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9335456,K01MH106710,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Surveys', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric epidemiology', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reading', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rosa', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Self-Administered', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stressful Event', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'salivary assay', 'secondary analysis', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),K01,2017,166910,-0.00343950835771476

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine.

"Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment SUMMARY Detecting the first and earliest stages of cognitive decline, conceptualized as “mild cognitive impairment” (MCI), has become increasingly important in recent years, as research focuses on delaying the manifestations of more severe stages of decline. It is now well recognized that changes in performance on cognitive tests begin up to ten years (or longer) before clinically apparent symptoms of dementia or functional impairment appear. Conventional assessment methods for assessing cognition Conventional assessment methods typically use the spoken response modality in which subjects are asked to verbally respond to prompts, and examiners carefully listen to these responses and apply test manuals to compute scores. These assessment methods require trained specialists and can be burdensome because they need to performed in clinics, especially so with frequent reassessment. Automating the scoring of assessment is important, not only for alleviating this burden but also for enabling large-scale studies on new intervention methods. Our research goal is to automate detection of MCI by developing, applying, and evaluating a system for automation of verbal (i.e., using spoken responses) cognitive-test scoring. Focusing on four verbal cognitive tests, we develop an extensible system comprising ASR and machine-learning algorithms to automatically score responses, and measure the efficacy of our proposed method by validating the accuracy of the automatically obtained scores against gold-standard, clinically obtained scores (Aim 1). Next, we develop classification methods for detecting individuals with MCI based on all information available in the verbal responses, and validating this classification against gold-standard clinical consensus. NARRATIVE Early detection of mild cognitive disease (MCI) is significantly important to delay more severe stages of cognitive decline. Conventional assessment methods require trained specialists and can be financially beyond the reach of most. We propose a tool for automatically scoring verbal cognitive tests. The proposed tool can be embedded in electronic devices providing the opportunity to assess large number of people in their homes, enabling clinicians to focus on those who are most at risk of cognitive decline.",Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment,9297093,R21AG055749,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Automation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Vascular Cognitive Impairment', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'response', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,184739,-0.032424084654984586
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care.

"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values. This work aims to improve our ability to extract useful information from electronic health records to enable disease subtyping, particularly in the area of mental health.",Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records,9453180,K01LM012529,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatology', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'response', 'treatment response']",NLM,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,189054,0.016675577347460776
"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will test if it is possible to objectively characterize epileptic phenotypes in mice using a breakthrough technology involving machine learning-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of behavior. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to dramatically accelerate epilepsy research by enabling the objective, automated, inexpensive phenotyping of experimental animals to aid the testing of novel anticonvulsant therapies.",Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy,9369284,R21NS102908,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Knockout Mice', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Sodium Channel', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'voltage']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,197528,-0.013194149434733403
"Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promises to transform the way that physicians treat their patients, resulting in better quality and more consistent care informed directly by the totality of relevant evidence. However, clinicians do not have the time to keep up to date with the vast medical literature. Systematic reviews, which provide rigorous, comprehensive and transparent assessments of the evidence pertaining to specific clinical questions, promise to mitigate this problem by concisely summarizing all pertinent evidence. But producing such reviews has become increasingly burdensome (and hence expensive) due in part to the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base, hampering our ability to provide evidence-based care.  If we are to scale EBM to meet the demands imposed by the rapidly growing volume of published evidence, then we must modernize EBM tools and methods. More specifically, if we are to continue generating up-to-date evidence syntheses, then we must optimize the systematic review process. Toward this end, we propose developing new methods that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to facilitate efficient annotation of the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. These annotations will comprise mark-up of sections of text that discuss clinically relevant fields of importance in EBM, such as discussion of patient characteristics, interventions studied and potential sources of bias. Such annotations would make literature search and data extraction much easier for systematic reviewers, thus reducing their workload and freeing more time for them to conduct thoughtful evidence synthesis.  This will be the first in-depth exploration of crowdsourcing for EBM. We will collect annotations from workers with varying levels of expertise and cost, ranging from medical students to workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will develop and evaluate novel methods of aggregating annotations from such heterogeneous sources. And we will use the acquired manual annotations to train machine learning models that automate this markup process. Models capable of automatically identifying clinically salient text snippets in full-text articles describing clinical trials would be broadly useful for biomedical literature retrieval tasks and would have impact beyond our immediate application of EBM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to annotate clinically important sentences in full-text articles describing clinical trials Ultimately, we aim to automate such annotation, thereby enabling more efficient practice of evidence- based medicine (EBM).",Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities,9275458,UH2CA203711,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'demographics', 'detector', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,210198,0.020750309177273208
"SWIFT-ActiveScreener: research and development of an intelligent web-based document screening system Project Summary More than 4,000 systematic reviews are performed each year in the fields of environmental health and evidence- based medicine, with each review requiring, on average, between six months to one year of effort to complete. In order to remain accurate, systematic reviews require regular updates after their initial publication, with most reviews out of date within five years. In the screening phase of systematic review, researchers use detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria to decide whether each article in a set of candidate citations is relevant to the research question under consideration. For each article considered, a researcher reads the title and abstract and evaluates its content with respect to the prespecified criteria. A typical review may require screening thousands or tens of thousands of articles in this manner. Under the assumption that it takes a skilled reviewer 30-90 seconds, on average, to screen a single abstract, dual-screening a set of 10,000 abstracts may require between 150 to 500 hours of labor. We have shown in previous work that automated machine learning methods for article prioritization can reduce by more than 50% the human effort required to screen articles for inclusion in a systematic review. Recently, we have further extended these methods and packaged them into a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application called SWIFT-Active Screener. Active Screener has been used successfully to reduce the effort required to screen articles for systematic reviews conducted at a variety of organizations including the National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), The Endocrine Disruption Exchange (TEDX), and the Evidence Based Toxicology Collaboration (EBTC). These early adopters have provided us with an abundance of useful data and user feedback, and we have identified several areas where we can continue to improve our methods and software. Our goal for the current proposal is to conduct additional research and development to make significant improvements to SWIFT-Active Screener, including several innovations that will be necessary for commercial success. The research we propose encompasses three specific aims: (1) Investigate several improvements to statistical algorithms used for article prioritization and recall estimation. We will explore promising avenues for further improving the performance of our existing algorithms and address critical technical issues that limit the applicability of our current methods (Aim 1 – Improved Statistical Models). (2) Explore ways in which we can improve our models and methods to handle the scenario in which an existing systematic review is updated with new data several years after its initial publication (Aim 2 – New Methods for Systematic Review Updates). (3) Investigate several questions related to scaling the system to support hundreds to thousands of simultaneous screeners (Aim 3 - Software Engineering for Scalability, Usability and Full Text Extraction). Project Narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application that uses machine learning to prioritize documents for screening, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.",SWIFT-ActiveScreener: research and development of an intelligent web-based document screening system,9467160,R43ES029001,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environmental Health', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'United States Department of Agriculture', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Update', 'Work', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'research and development', 'screening', 'success', 'systematic review', 'usability']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R43,2017,211900,0.008582708491583397
"Deep learning for representation of codes used for SEER-Medicare claims research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose developing an algorithm and user-friendly software to better identify treatments using Medicare claims data. We will validate our approach using procedures listed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database as a gold standard. In this way, we hope to better match procedures identified using Medicare claims data with SEER listed procedures.  The focus of this research is observational (i.e. non-randomized) data. Well-run randomized clinical trials can provide the best level of evidence of treatment effects. However, randomized trials in the United States have suffered from poor accrual for many interventions. Despite the fact that well-designed randomized clinical trials should be the gold standard, well-designed observational studies might be the only method of obtaining inferences concerning comparative effectiveness for some cancer interventions.  In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked SEER-Medicare database. SEER-Medicare data has provided useful measurements of the effectiveness of a number of cancer therapies. Algorithms for identifying relevant treatment and diagnosis codes using Medicare data are often based on clinical reasoning and scientific evidence. One group of researchers, for example, developed an algorithm for identifying laparoscopic surgery among kidney cancer cases before claims codes for laparoscopic surgery were well developed. While such algorithms are useful for others pursuing similar investigations, there may still be substantial mismatch between treatment identified by the SEER cancer registry and treatment identified through Medicare claims. In this work, we propose developing a rigorous machine learning algorithm that can help researchers in better identifying treatments in Medicare claims data. Specifically, we will design a neural language modeling algorithm and implement a software system that finds vector representations of diagnosis and procedure codes.  We plan on using the neural language modeling algorithm to learn vector representations from SEER- Medicare claims data where related procedure and diagnosis codes are ""neighbors"" (i.e. closely related). We will investigate whether the codes we identify within neighborhoods correspond to the procedure codes used for published SEER-Medicare studies. We will then design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes. Finally, we will investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm by comparing procedures identified using Medicare claims with procedures listed in the SEER database. We will replicate analyses from a published SEER-Medicare paper to investigate if estimated treatment effects differ when using our novel algorithm compared to using the algorithm in the published paper. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. To improve the identification of procedures when using Medicare claims data, we will design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data. This pioneering research directly impacts public health by improving the quality of care through enhanced reminder functionality in the EHRs.",A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications,9201329,R00LM011575,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Area', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Institution', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'open source', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R00,2017,248969,0.017711228034545452
"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements (DS) and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); our ability to readily identify interactions between DS with prescription medications is currently very limited. To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored. Our long-term goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate its findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support systems. The objective of this application is to develop an informatics framework to enable the discovery of DSIs by creating a DS terminology and mining scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. Towards these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Compile a comprehensive DS terminology using online resources; and (2) Discover potential DSIs from the biomedical literature. The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel informatics paradigm and resources for identifying most clinically significant DSI signals and their biological mechanisms. This information is critical to subsequent efforts aimed at improving patient safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The results from this study are imperative in order to achieve the ultimate goal of reducing an individual’s risk of potential DSIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will address a critical and unmet need to conduct large-scale clinical research in drug-supplement interactions (DSIs) and improve evidence bases for healthcare practice. Our primary overarching goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate our findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support.

"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9251814,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2017,300000,0.014068092811552798
"Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert’s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert’s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm’s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay. The proposed research is relevant to public health because dysphagia is related to nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, it increases pneumonia incidence, prolongs hospital stays by 40% for patients with many diseases, and is prevalent in acute care hospitals and nursing homes. Choking (airway obstruction) and pneumonia due to aspiration (inhalation of swallowed food and liquids), are common results of dysphagia, and both are preventable when dysphagia is identified before patients are offered oral food, liquids or medications. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to enhancing health, lengthening life and reducing illnesses, as we will develop new data analytics tools to be used along with high-resolution cervical auscultation in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia and predict dysphagia-related adverse events before they can harm patients with dysphagia.",Instrumental screening for dysphagia by combining high-resolution cervical auscultation with advanced data analysis tools to identify silent dysphagia and silent aspiration,9355417,R01HD092239,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirate substance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Auscultation', 'Biomechanics', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Choking', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dehydration', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Group Homes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'screening', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'vibration']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,302394,-0.0012640970268326431
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9275549,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,330348,0.0022010223718931356
"Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Individual sleep disorders and characteristics are known to be associated with adverse health outcomes. However, few studies consider sleep in a multivariate context. Therefore, we propose a paradigmatic shift in sleep research towards sleep health. Conducting research through a sleep health lens can change health practice by clarifying which sleep characteristics are most important to treat, enhancing screening efforts, and facilitating the generalization of findings to all individuals, not just those with specific sleep disorders or complaints. Before achieving these long-term goals, however, the crucial first steps in the study of sleep health are to determine which sleep profiles predict health outcomes (Aim 1), and develop predictive algorithms that can identify individuals at risk of adverse health outcomes based on their sleep and other risk factors (Aim 2). These aims can only be achieved with an awareness of the statistical challenges related to the inherent multidimensionality of sleep health (e.g. multiple domains of sleep, multiple characteristics to represent each domain, multiple data sources, etc.). This multidimensionality generates substantial methodological barriers regarding variable and model selection and threatens researchers' abilities to develop transparent and reproducible models. In this R01, investigators will apply rigorous, sophisticated statistical methods to a large aggregated sample of adults aged >60 with self-report and polysomnographic characterization and over 10 years of longitudinal follow-up from three parent studies: Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Sleep Study (MrOS), Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). In Aim 1, investigators will determine which multidimensional sleep profiles predict time to mortality in older adults using Cox-proportional hazards models, tree-structured survival analysis, and clustering. In Aim 2, investigators will develop powerful machine learning algorithms that incorporate sleep and other risk factors to identify which older adults have the greatest risk for early mortality. Within each aim, the impact of sex and race will be rigorously investigated, and models will be internally validated in independent samples to ensure reproducibility. The Secondary Aim is to investigate generalizability to studies with different demographic profiles and sleep protocols (Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, Honolulu Asia Aging Study of Sleep America) and different data types (sleep diary, actigraphy). All models will be developed in the context of other important known risk factors, including but not limited to age, gender, race, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and BMI. Findings from Aim 1 will jumpstart subsequent mechanistic research focused on sleep-related causal factors of mortality, leading to identification of targeted treatments for sleep problems that could reduce risk of mortality and morbidity. Findings from Aim 2 will provide important preliminary evidence for enhanced screening tools that can more accurately identify which individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project initiates a paradigmatic research shift by studying multivariate sleep health in older adults. Cutting- edge statistical methods will be applied to a large, multi-cohort sample, and replicability of findings will be rigorously investigated. Achieving the proposed aims will improve health practice by: (1) determining which multivariate sleep profiles predict mortality in older adults, thereby jumpstarting subsequent mechanistic research on sleep-related causal factors of mortality and targeted treatments to reduce mortality; and (2) suggesting prediction algorithms that incorporate sleep to enhance health screening for adverse health outcomes in older adults.",Sleep Health Profiles and Mortality Risk in Older Adults: A Multi-Cohort Application of Novel Statistical Methods,9360318,R01AG056331,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Asia', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Vision', 'Wakefulness', 'Well in self', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'actigraphy', 'aged', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'diaries', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'health practice', 'improved', 'lens', 'men', 'mortality', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prediction algorithm', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,353303,0.003640190643839921
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems.

"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems.

"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9250167,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,400107,-0.003149710853832814
"Web Software to develop an RDoC-Compatible Adaptive Diagnostic Nosology, the SID-5 n psychiatry, clinical judgment has been the predominant method of diagnosis. The `gold standard” for clinical research is the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5). The SCID-5 promotes reliability, but its validity is questionable. There is growing recognition that biomarkers can be used to identify more homogeneous patient populations, but there is substantial phenotypic discordance for schizophrenia even in identical twins. In the absence of symptom data, biomarkers alone are unlikely to yield a clinical diagnosis.  In a past SBIR project, TeleSage Inc. successfully converted the paper SCID into a web-based software program. The NetSCID-5 is now widely used in research. Nevertheless, in order to achieve the goal of “turning clinical care networks into centers for research” (Insel, Director's Blog, 2012) and furthering the RDoC initiative, we need a means of gathering rigorous diagnostic data in routine clinical care. This software must (a) require minimal clinician time, (b) allow clinics to bill according to the current DSM-5 categories, and (c) be able to gather the large amount of data necessary to inform a broad research agenda including machine learning techniques. TeleSage proposes to develop a self-report diagnostic assessment that satisfies both immediate clinical needs and broader research goals: the “Screening Interview for Diagnosis” or SID.  TeleSage has worked with an expert panel including Dr. Michael First, the primary author of the SCID- 5, iteratively developing and testing self-report items. Based on expert panel review and cognitive interviewing, we identified a final set of 661 unique self-report, Likert-scale items covering all of the individual sub-symptoms described within each of the SCID criteria. TeleSage has also created a behavioral health PORTAL that includes the NetSCID-5, IRT/CAT item administration, randomization, and longitudinal reporting capabilities. The PORTAL exchanges data and reports with several EHRs including the NetSmart EHR system.  This Direct-to-Phase II application aims to create the SID, which will (a) reside on our existing secure web PORTAL, (b) administer simple Likert-scale self-report items, (c) generate DSM-5 and ICD-10 diagnoses for billing, (d) use minimal clinician time, (e) pull pre-defined data fields from the EHR (e.g. family history, demographic, and biomarker data), (f) be able to add new self-report items for exploration, (g) integrate with machine learning tools, and (h) send raw data and interpretive reports to EHR systems. Because of these features, we believe that the SID has the potential to be used widely by both clinicians and researchers.  The SID is intended to help transcend DSM-5 and to support RDoC. The SID product must be commercially successful and useful both in routine clinical care and research. The SID is intended to facilitate the development and evolution of a new behavioral health nosology based on the aggregation of biomarker and symptom data, a nosology that is more analogous to those found in other fields of medicine. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) represents the current diagnostic gold standard in behavioral health and yields much more reliable diagnoses than the unstructured patient interviews that predominate in clinical settings; however, the full SCID-5 is a lengthy and complex paper-and-pencil instrument that takes approximately 90 minutes to administer and is thus seldom used outside of clinical research settings. We want to create a new, self-report software tool that will save clinicians time relative to the paper SCID, significantly reduce diagnostic error rates, greatly increase the reliability of diagnoses in routine clinical care, and integrate seamlessly into Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems: the Screening Inventory for Diagnosis (SID). The SID is a self-report, computer-adaptive diagnostic assessment, based on easy-to- understand, five-point Likert-scale items. The SID is intended to help transcend DSM-5, support RDoC, and facilitate the development and evolution of a new behavioral health nosology based on the aggregation of biomarker and symptom data.","Web Software to develop an RDoC-Compatible Adaptive Diagnostic Nosology, the SID-5",9255772,R44MH108177,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Brain scan', 'Categories', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'data exchange', 'disease classification', 'epigenetic marker', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'instrument', 'mental health center', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptom cluster', 'tool', 'usability', 'web portal']",NIMH,"TELESAGE, INC.",R44,2017,433630,0.0029294960176394565
"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II Project Summary Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Clinical performance assessment emphasizes learner evaluation over learner development, lacks rigor and utility for developmental purposes, and clinical teachers have expressed particular difficulty with diagnosing reasoning deficits for remediation purposes. Further, medical students' diagnostic reasoning does not improve over the course of clinical training and senior medical students have highly variable diagnostic performance that is often rated below expectations according to theory-based and validated scoring criteria. Independent practice does not necessarily enhance the context for clinical reasoning; the majority of physicians' medical errors are thought to be diagnostic in nature. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Improve reliability of human scoring of DXJ essays. 2) Extend the automated scoring algorithms. 3) Automated reasoning failure categorization and remediation. 4) Complete the software development required for delivering the commercial product. 5) Evaluate predictive validity of automatically scored DXJ essays. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine. Project Narrative Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.","Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II",9339455,R42GM108104,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Case Based Learning', 'Case Study', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Competence', 'Community Health Education', 'Competence', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Incubators', 'Instruction', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Role', 'Sales', 'Schedule', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Teaching Method', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'educational atmosphere', 'essays', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'prototype', 'remediation', 'research and development', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'software development', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'undergraduate medical education', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"PARALLEL CONSULTING, LLC",R42,2017,500000,0.0059174733968471475
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,9323511,R01GM097618,"['Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Coxibs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'synergism']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,536041,-0.011385743143133892
"Characterizing Alzheimer's Disease with INSPECDS: Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT  It is estimated that Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), Fronto-temporal dementia and Vascular dementia. Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for Alzheimer's disease, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage day and night assessment technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) to profile Alzheimer's and other dementias. The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be the Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), the Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated intially for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea but has more recently been applied to assess Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The AMP is unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks and has proven effective in characterizing cognitive decline in Alzheimer's. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real- time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits in Alzheimer's and other dementias. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies with submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements to quantify the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine- learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to finalize implementation of a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud- based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of Alzheimer's and other dementias.

"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data.

Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of research participants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, clinical course, and treatment options for neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need, Advanced Brain Monitoring (Carlsbad, CA) is developing Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profilers for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS), which will provide an inexpensive, non-invasive solution combining neurocognitive, electrophysiological (EEG, ECG, EMG), and sleep-behavior assessment into a single, integrated system featuring automated scoring and classification algorithms. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of research participants.                ",Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS),9360534,R44AG050326,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chin', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Depressed mood', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Industry', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'FDA approved', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Head Movements', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Minor', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Process', 'REM Sleep Behavior Disorder', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stratification', 'Stroke', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wireless Technology', 'alertness', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cloud based', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'data acquisition', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'genetic association', 'human subject', 'limb movement', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurocognitive test', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'synucleinopathy', 'tool']",NIA,"ADVANCED BRAIN MONITORING, INC.",R44,2017,727746,-0.020041488739509446
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9239538,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2016,36936,0.021202085527598436
"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,9270103,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'clinical investigation', 'education research', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2016,43143,-0.0005722916132125716
"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,9144793,R03OH010956,[' '],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2016,66564,-0.009981659594214301
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,9103879,U54EB020405,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'massive open online courses', 'models and simulation', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reduce symptoms', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool', 'visiting scholar']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2016,68981,0.02111009090826029

"Empiric Testing and enhancement of web-based abstract screening tool(Abstrackr) EMPIRICAL TESTING AND ENHANCEMENT OF WEB-BASED ABSTRACT SCREENING TOOL (ABSTRACKR)  In this year-long project, we aim to empirically assess the performance and efficiency of state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine and stakeholder-driven comparative effectiveness reviews. We have developed AbstrackrTM (hereon, Abstrackr), a human-guided computerized abstract screening tool that aims to reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. Abstrackr makes use of machine learning techniques, and is offered as a free web-based tool that enables management of the screening process.  We also aim to revise the web-interface of Abstrackr to make it more intuitive, user friendly, and add documentation and functionalities requested by users; and to revise Abstrackr’s back-end, which includes the way the software parses and analyses citations, fits machine learning models, and makes computations, to make it more efficient. These revisions will ensure that the tool becomes more robust, and that it remains usable for larger projects and for many teams.  The proposed work will be carried out by the developers of Abstrackr, comprising a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators and computer scientists at Brown University and the University of Texas at Austin, who have been working together for at least seven years. We will pursue dissemination of the findings of this assessment and of the revised tool through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its wider adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Evidence-based Practice Center Program, Cochrane Collaboration, and other groups conducting systematic reviews. We will also continue to make all code available online. Our aims are to: Aim 1. Empirically measure the efficiency and accuracy of the prediction algorithms in Abstrackr in the computer-assisted semi-automated screening of citations for eligibility in systematic reviews. Aim 2. Improve and add to the functionality of the Web-based Abstrackr software, based in part on enhancements suggested by a panel of identified heavy users. Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making and systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to assess the performance and efficiency of a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care, and to augment the functionality of its public implementation.",Empiric Testing and enhancement of web-based abstract screening tool(Abstrackr),9168247,R03HS024812,[' '],AHRQ,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2016,99999,0.0034262120992386387
"Supporting Systematic Review Production with Article Similarity Network Visualization PROJECT SUMMARY Systematic reviews (SRs), or systematic reviews of literature, summarize evidence drawn from high quality studies, and are often the preferred source of evidence-based practice (EBP). However, conducting an SR is labor-intensive and time consuming, typically requiring several months to complete. It has been reported that more than ten thousands of SRs are needed to synthesize existing medical knowledge. An Article screening process is one of the most intensive and time consuming steps, which requires SR researchers to screen a large amount of references, ranging from hundreds to more than 10,000 articles, depending on the size of a SR. In the past 10 years, machine learning model training approaches24-29 were developed to accelerate the article selection process through automation. However, they are not widely used due to diffusion challenges.7,14 Major obstacles include 1) a training sample is required to generate the automation algorithm. If the training sample is biased, the article selection process will systematically fail; 2) the automation approach is not made available for non-computer science specialists, therefore SR researchers will not be able to “fine-tune” the automation algorithm for particular conditions in various SR topics; 3) As there is no global automation algorithm, the generalizability is significantly limited; 4) It is difficult to assess the actual workload saved, while finding every relevant article is required in SR. We propose a new approach to provide views of article relationships in an article network. This is different from other bibliometric networks constructing citation, co-author, or co-occurrence networks. Article network is a simple and logical concept: visualizing article relationships and distribution based on articles' similarities in titles, abstracts, keywords, publication types, etc. SR researchers can also alter the article distribution by adjusting the similarities. This approach does not aim to suggest an end-point of the screening process. Rather, it provides a view of distribution for included, excluded, and undecided articles. In the proposed research, we will integrate advanced techniques to sparsify article networks with mixed sparsification methods, and improve the quality and efficiency of large network visualization layouts by constructing a multi-level network structure and advanced force model. We aim to provide approaches to sparsify and visualize article networks with more than 10,000 articles. Our approach is highly generalizable that it can be used for any health science topics. By viewing the article distribution, SR researchers will be able to screen a large amount of literature more efficiently. This approach can be integrated into current SR technologies and used directly by SR researchers. The success of this project can support SR production on any health science topics, and thus streamline their ultimate application in EBP paradigms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Systematic reviews (SRs) provide the highest quality of research evidence for patient care. To accelerate the production of SRs, we will implement advanced visualization techniques to view article relationships and distribution with article networks and in a timely and human readable manner. The success of the project will support SR production and thus streamline their ultimate application to evidence-based practice.",Supporting Systematic Review Production with Article Similarity Network Visualization,9227858,R03HS025047,[' '],AHRQ,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2016,100000,0.01065936746799638
"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials. The overall aim of this project is to identify multimodal biomarkers of FTLD.",Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration,9068732,K01AG043503,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Country', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychology', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'pre-doctoral', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'social', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2016,128358,-0.0046532338006072425
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,9121614,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Mobility', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Degree program', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker panel', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2016,135270,-0.025543542017712327
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,9096792,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2016,155914,0.021202085527598436
"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD. This effort has significant public health implications, as it can lead to new treatment targets and result in the accurate allocation of treatment resources to those most in need.","Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1",9123674,K01MH102415,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'CNR2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corticotropin', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'New York City', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'data to knowledge', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional disability', 'genetic analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'pediatric trauma', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'response', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'social', 'stress resilience', 'traumatic event', 'urinary']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2016,165886,-0.002268787428576773
"Novel Informatics Approaches for Ascertainment of PAD Status and Adverse Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant and principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified cardiologist, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Senior Associate Consultant in the Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Division. [The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator in translational informatics focused on the development, validation and deployment of electronic tools to the point-of-care to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. The PI intends to leverage the EHR to conduct population-based studies using electronic algorithms that include NLP and by application of state-of-the-art informatics approaches to deliver the knowledge at the point-of-care in support of patient-centered decision-making for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

"A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last decade has seen explosive growth of online social networks (OSNs), which are now a pervasive part of everyday life for many people. ""Big data"" analyses of OSNs have enormous potential to enable new discoveries and applications in public health. For example we may soon be able to study how mental health indicators vary over time and between communities and regions; how major events like disasters and mass shootings affect community mental health; and potentially even use social media for individual-level screening and diagnosis. But in order to do this effectively, psychologists need to know how to make sense of vast amounts of digital records of raw behavior. That will require interdisciplinary collaborations between psychology and computer science to create new tools and methods for automated analyses of mental health variables in large and complex datasets. The goal of this project is to develop new metrics for doing large-scale, ""big data"" mental health research on Twitter, a popular online social network service with a large and diverse user base in the United States that makes most user-generated content publicly available. We are particularly interested in how Twitter data can be used to draw inferences about users' personality traits (which are indicative of risk and vulnerability), emotions, and clinical symptoms. To date, researchers studying mental health on Twitter have focused on a small number of metrics which often differ from study to study and are not always well-validated. We do not yet have a unified, comprehensive understanding of how mental health characteristics can be measured and studied online. Our project has three goals. First, we will gather data from a very large, representative sample of American Twitter users to map out what meaningful metrics can be derived from Twitter data. What can be reliably measured, and how are different kinds of metrics related to each other? By studying relationships and overlaps among these variables, we expect to identify a key set of online metrics that can be used to characterize important psychological differences among users. Second, we will recruit a sample of Twitter users to complete standardized assessments of personality, emotion, and clinical symptoms. We will look to see what kinds of online behaviors are reliable and valid markers of these psychological variables. Third, to demonstrate the utility of these markers we will monitor millions of Twitter accounts around the country for one year to measure how one specific kind of community trauma, mass shootings, affects indicators of personality, emotion, and mental health. We expect to find effects of such events on the online expression of emotion and clinical symptoms immediately following an event, and perhaps longer-term effects that endure beyond the immediate aftermath.

"Deep learning for representation of codes used for SEER-Medicare claims research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose developing an algorithm and user-friendly software to better identify treatments using Medicare claims data. We will validate our approach using procedures listed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database as a gold standard. In this way, we hope to better match procedures identified using Medicare claims data with SEER listed procedures.  The focus of this research is observational (i.e. non-randomized) data. Well-run randomized clinical trials can provide the best level of evidence of treatment effects. However, randomized trials in the United States have suffered from poor accrual for many interventions. Despite the fact that well-designed randomized clinical trials should be the gold standard, well-designed observational studies might be the only method of obtaining inferences concerning comparative effectiveness for some cancer interventions.  In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked SEER-Medicare database. SEER-Medicare data has provided useful measurements of the effectiveness of a number of cancer therapies. Algorithms for identifying relevant treatment and diagnosis codes using Medicare data are often based on clinical reasoning and scientific evidence. One group of researchers, for example, developed an algorithm for identifying laparoscopic surgery among kidney cancer cases before claims codes for laparoscopic surgery were well developed. While such algorithms are useful for others pursuing similar investigations, there may still be substantial mismatch between treatment identified by the SEER cancer registry and treatment identified through Medicare claims. In this work, we propose developing a rigorous machine learning algorithm that can help researchers in better identifying treatments in Medicare claims data. Specifically, we will design a neural language modeling algorithm and implement a software system that finds vector representations of diagnosis and procedure codes.  We plan on using the neural language modeling algorithm to learn vector representations from SEER- Medicare claims data where related procedure and diagnosis codes are ""neighbors"" (i.e. closely related). We will investigate whether the codes we identify within neighborhoods correspond to the procedure codes used for published SEER-Medicare studies. We will then design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes. Finally, we will investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm by comparing procedures identified using Medicare claims with procedures listed in the SEER database. We will replicate analyses from a published SEER-Medicare paper to investigate if estimated treatment effects differ when using our novel algorithm compared to using the algorithm in the published paper.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. To improve the identification of procedures when using Medicare claims data, we will design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes. This should improve the identification of procedures when using Medicare claims data, and make conclusions drawn from analyses using the database more reliable and consistent.            ",Deep learning for representation of codes used for SEER-Medicare claims research,9023921,R21CA202130,"['Algorithms', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Ethical Issues', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Laparoscopic Surgical Procedures', 'Learning', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Study', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Update', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplasm registry', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'relating to nervous system', 'software systems', 'treatment effect', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'vector', 'volunteer']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R21,2016,178072,-0.031310151198765714
"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9147612,K01ES026837,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'research facility', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,178606,0.02036707161011284
"Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study focuses on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) because, left untreated, it is the leading cause of blindness in the adult US population over 50. The goals of this program are twofold. First, the focus is to develop new screening tools to detect individuals with the intermediate stage of AMD, that are otherwise asymptomatic for vision loss, at a stage where they can be referred to a clinician for treatment and follow up, and when vision more likely can be preserved. The second goal is to develop Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA) tools that help characterize Geographic Atrophy (GA), for which novel treatments are being investigated. We are developing data-driven algorithms for AMD screening which leverage recent advances in machine learning and machine intelligence and do not rely on detecting and counting or sizing drusen (a procedure which can be error prone). Instead, our method analyzes a fundus image as a whole using an image classification paradigm, and may also exploit ancillary patient information. Our goal is to use the AREDS dbGaP that includes thousands of images from hundreds of patients and offers a unique opportunity to develop and test these algorithms on a scale that has not previously been possible. Our team consists of the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, which will serve as the clinical analysis test site, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which will conduct the automated screening software tool analysis, development and testing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are twofold. First, in order to work towards improving outcome, our goal is to develop novel software screening tools that allow for the automated detection of individuals with the intermediate stage AMD so that they may be referred to clinicians for follow up and treatment at an earlier stage than would otherwise occur. Second, we will develop new tools to characterize the evolution of GA, for which new treatments are being developed and tested. Our project is a secondary study on the AREDS dbGaP, which will be leveraged for the development and validation of these new algorithms on a scale never before attempted.",Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration,8998947,R21EY024310,"['Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biotechnology', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Cataract', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Discipline', 'Drusen', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myopia', 'National Eye Institute', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Pigmentation physiologic function', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'age related', 'bioimaging', 'computer program', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'geographic atrophy', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'tool']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,180061,-0.023779846755111137
"Machine Learning Development for Subtyping COPD Project Summary Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care. To date, researchers have attempted to use standard machine learning methodology to identify more meaningful subtypes of COPD, but these methods often make general assumptions about the data, limiting their ability to penetrate more complex patterns in some data sets. Thus, a meaningful reclassification of COPD subtypes that could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions has been elusive. The applicant introduces a new way of looking at the COPD subtyping problem by recasting it in terms of discovering associations of individuals to disease trajectories – i.e., grouping individuals based on their similarity in response to environmental and/or disease causing variables. The machine learning methods proposed build on the most recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics, a collection of theoretical ideas and techniques that permit very flexible data representations. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that these machine learning methods and extensions thereof – together with data sources not previously leveraged for COPD subtyping – will produce more biologically meaningful sub-groupings of patients, leading to a better understanding of the genetic and biological underpinnings of the disease and ultimately improved patient management. Aim 1 of this application involves evaluating the utility of CT-assessed lung mass – a potentially more discriminative measure of emphysema than conventionally used measures – for defining COPD subtypes using both K-means clustering and our disease trajectory algorithm. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the utility of comorbidity data for defining COPD subtypes using our trajectory clustering algorithm. Novel computed tomography based measures of muscle wasting (cachexia) and pulmonary vascular pruning will be explored to determine their efficacy in subtype determination. Additionally, we will extend and test the trajectory algorithm in order to model discrete outputs (such as physician-diagnosed comorbidities), count data (e.g. exacerbations), and time-to-event data (death). In Aim 3, the applicant will extend our trajectory clustering algorithms to directly incorporate genetic and omics data for subtype discovery. Together, the research proposed in the aims of this award will take full advantage of the comprehensive data set available through the COPDGene study. Execution of the aims in this proposal will be possible through active collaboration with Dr. Ron Kikinis, M.D., a renowned leader in the field of medical image analysis, and Dr. Ed Silverman, an internationally recognized expert in the genetic epidemiology of COPD. Project Narrative Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict health decline and develop targeted treatments for better patient care.

"Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For many years, there has been a concerted effort to automate the analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) rhythms. However, despite significant advances in biomedical signal analysis, there has not been any significant improvement in automated decision support systems. FHR monitoring is now ubiquitous throughout delivery rooms, especially using the non-invasive Doppler monitor, but also using the fetal scalp electrode. Physician classification of fetal heart rate patterns is known to be a non-trivial problem because of significant inter and intra-observer variability of diagnosis. This has led to a marked increase in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby increasing risk to the fetus and mother in many cases. This has further motivated the machine learning community to automate the classification procedure in the interest of accuracy and consistency as well as robustness with respect to noise. Usual approaches to this involve some type of supervised classification procedure, where the algorithm output on training data is compared with a ""gold-standard"" physician classification, followed by testing and validation on new datasets. However, since physician classification can be unreliable in the presence of the aforementioned diagnostic variability, as well as significant tracing noise, we propose the use of unsupervised algorithms to cluster FHR data records into clinically useful categories. We use nonparametric Bayes theory and Markov-time-dependence models for the evolution of feature sequences to propose methods that will achieve improved accuracy. The methods involve extraction of feature sequences from FHR time series data, which are modeled as samples from finite or infinite Dirichlet mixture models. We then use Gibbs sampling to obtain the cluster probabilities for each dataset. Clustering outcomes are compared against direct physician diagnosis and our current results are seen to be in broad agreement with them, while still giving new information on the character of different sub-groups of FHR records. With the proposed research, further gains in classification performance will be made. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fetal heart rate monitoring is now commonly used during childbirth and, at present, physicians read and interpret these data to classify fetal heart rate patterns and make sure that the baby is not in distress during the course of labor. However, there is great variability in how individual doctors interpret the tracings and this has led increases in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby potentially increasing risk to both mothers and babies. Thus there has been a concerted effort from the machine learning community to develop an accurate automatic reading and classification procedure so that correct interpretation of fetal heart rates during labor is more diagnostic and consistent.",Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring,9018050,R21HD080025,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Categories', 'Cesarean section', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Delivery Rooms', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Fetal Heart', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Freedom', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mothers', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Umbilical cord structure', 'Uncertainty', 'Uterine Contraction', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'fetal', 'heart rate monitor', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning community', 'pressure', 'stem', 'theories', 'vector']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2016,193120,-0.00011713732924761496
"Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excess body fat is a key underlying factor in the development of numerous chronic diseases, including type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The AMA recently declared that obesity, itself, is a disease. Most epidemiologic studies utilize Body Mass Index (BMI) to classify people as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese because it is a convenient and simple method that has been shown to correlate with disease risk. Since the majority of the health risks associated with obesity are more directly linked to an overabundance of body fat than weight, measuring body fat is essential for more precise guidelines. However, accurate methods of assessing body fat are expensive, inconvenient, and require immobile equipment. Consequently, the AMA has called for more cost effective and convenient methods to assess body composition to assist doctors in their assessment and treatment. Virtual modeling of humans in particular has provided ways to scan and analyze the body and its motion. Supervised Machine Learning (SML), a sub-field of artificial intelligence, has made great progress in taking measured data to infer new relationships. It is our belief that virtual modeling and SML can provide the techniques necessary to conveniently and accurately calculate the percentage of body fat (%BF) and to provide new tools in treating obesity based on body shapes. The project will develop a system that uses commercially available depth cameras such as the Microsoft Kinect(r) to capture the surface of the human body. This will be accomplished by developing a new algorithm to perform deformable registration of several RGB-Depth views of the body. A new algorithm that uses SML will be developed to calculate percentage body fat using the surface data. The system will be trained and validated by collecting data from a number of subjects. The surface captured will be used to explore the role of visual body representation in motivation and adherence. The developed systems can be implemented in clinical or personal settings and be utilized as a public health research tool and deployed widely given the low-cost of the hardware required. In addition to the immediate impact that the system will have on managing obesity, the project will have a broad impact on a number of areas. A large database of such shapes captured over time may lead to ways to predict how an individual's body shape will change given a particular intervention. Certain medical conditions that result in body shape change, such as those involving lymphatic circulations, may be diagnosed and tracked more easily.

"Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare Project Summary As United States healthcare seeks to address inconsistent quality and overwhelming cost, data and technology have become central to all suggested approaches. With newly available electronic health data and massive growth in processing power, the hardest challenges in using clinical data are becoming clear. Big data holds the potential to enable personalized patient care, population health management, and value-based payment models. However, it also creates challenges in discriminating accurate data from inaccurate or incomplete information. One of the greatest areas of data inaccuracy is the patient phenotype, or clinical description of the patient. Every clinical decision support tool, population health management system, and payment reform product relies on accurate electronic patient descriptions as its source data. But, the descriptions are not accurate, most notably in terms of completeness and granularity. Recall often falls below 50% in describing a patient’s medical conditions, such as heart failure and cancer. Detailed descriptions such as low ejection fraction heart failure or stage III breast cancer, needed for downstream analytics, are lacking in the discrete record. Poor data puts care delivery, payment reform, and population health efforts in peril. The time is right for technology to proactively define the clinical phenotype from source data, without reliance on current manual approaches. This will necessitate overcoming challenges in harmonizing discrepant narrative and discrete data, inferring when a characteristic such as cough is a primary condition versus symptom of another condition, and screening noise from signal in robust narrative text. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will include the following specific aims: 1. Create the components required to define an accurate and comprehensive clinical phenotype,  including: (i) extract problem, medication, procedure, and lab features from clinical data using  natural language processing (NLP) and ontologic mapping, (ii) build a large knowledge database  of associated clinical conditions, and (iii) assess extracted features against the knowledge  database to accurately distinguish symptoms from diseases and surface relevant active diseases  in a candidate problem list. 2. Validate the clinical phenotyping components using de-identified longitudinal clinical data for  10,000 patients The goal, dependent on Phase I success, is to create an automated, accurate, and robust clinical phenotyping engine to enable personalized patient care, population health management, and value- based payment models. Project Narrative Individual and global care improvement demands accurate phenotypes. This type of clinical phenotyping is extremely challenging, requiring full clinical data and advanced semantic technologies to develop a longitudinal patient map. The approach, if successful, offers an opportunity to empower national efforts to improve outcomes and reduce costs.",Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare,9199039,R43LM012357,"['Address', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Congresses', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Electronics', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'discrete data', 'empowered', 'experience', 'falls', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'payment', 'personalized care', 'population health', 'screening', 'success', 'support tools']",NLM,"VMT, INC.",R43,2016,222977,-0.006301364186615302
"Automated assessment using facial coding Abstract  Transition-age youth (TAY) from ages 18-26 are especially vulnerable to substance use, misuse, and substance use disorder (SUD). This developmental period, termed the “age of instability"" and ""emerging adulthood"" includes tasks such as leaving home, entering college; identifying vocational goals; working for the first time; body and sexuality changes; coalescing with a peer group; and for some, aging out of foster care or state custody, which end at age 18. The emerging- adulthood period is prime for experimentation with substances and the development of SUD, and associated problems such as binge drinking, driving under the influence, accidents, fighting and violence, HIV, gang involvement, suicide and self-harm, and vulnerability to date-rape and other sexual assault. A major challenge for TAY is the capacity to regulate their emotions, given the hormone changes and emotional intensity of this stage of life. Indeed, substance use is often described as a short-term way to regulate emotion and there is a long-standing literature documenting the association between emotion regulation (ER) problems and SUD. The importance of ER is also grounded in the developmental literature in which ER is identified as a core skill that is critical to the successful transition to adulthood. The initial component of ER, accurate identification of emotion, is itself a major challenge, especially for people with SUD as they are often not aware of their feelings or confused about them due to the nature of the disorder as well as mental health disorders that often co-occur with SUD.  In this phase 1 proposal we describe the development of a mobile app that uses exciting new technology (automated facial coding) to help TAY better recognize their emotions in relation to SUD variables. We describe the use of front-end focus groups to provide pre-development input on the app; we detail the app features and user experience; and define the app’s technical specifications. Phase 1 also includes a pilot feasibility study of the prototype product among TAY with SUD. They will have four weeks to use the app in their natural environment, such as home, and we will conduct pre- and post-evaluation using validated instruments to characterize the sample, quantity satisfaction and feasibility, evaluate emotion- and substance-related variables, as well as explore the app metrics and its technical performance. If positive results are found this would set us up well for phase 2, which could expand the app in some really interesting directions as well as further study it in a randomized controlled trial. The app product we envision would have major public health and clinical impact. It could help improve TAY’s ability to become more aware of their emotions and understand them in relation to SUD via an exciting emotion-focused technology innovation. If the product is successful it could also be expanded to other populations. Our stellar team includes experts in SUD, TAY, clinical innovations, technology, and app development. Narrative We propose to help young adults (ages 18-26) who have substance abuse problems. Our goal is to help them learn more about their emotions in relation to their substance abuse as a way to ultimately help them reduce their substance use. We plan to use a sophisticated technology related to emotion recognition, and to use that to help support the young adults in learning more about managing their emotions. Our work will include the development of a mobile app related to these goals.",Automated assessment using facial coding,9199791,R43DA042640,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Anger', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Focus Groups', 'Forcible intercourse', 'Goals', 'Guns', 'HIV', 'Home environment', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Nature', 'Overdose', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Peer Group', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sales', 'Sampling', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sexuality', 'Smiling', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'cloud based', 'college', 'craving', 'driving under influence', 'emerging adulthood', 'emotion regulation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fighting', 'foster care', 'gang', 'improved', 'information display', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'killings', 'lens', 'literacy', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'prototype', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'visual stimulus', 'young adult']",NIDA,"TREATMENT INNOVATIONS, LLC",R43,2016,225000,-0.02568014433793093
"Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promises to transform the way that physicians treat their patients, resulting in better quality and more consistent care informed directly by the totality of relevant evidence. However, clinicians do not have the time to keep up to date with the vast medical literature. Systematic reviews, which provide rigorous, comprehensive and transparent assessments of the evidence pertaining to specific clinical questions, promise to mitigate this problem by concisely summarizing all pertinent evidence. But producing such reviews has become increasingly burdensome (and hence expensive) due in part to the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base, hampering our ability to provide evidence-based care.  If we are to scale EBM to meet the demands imposed by the rapidly growing volume of published evidence, then we must modernize EBM tools and methods. More specifically, if we are to continue generating up-to-date evidence syntheses, then we must optimize the systematic review process. Toward this end, we propose developing new methods that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to facilitate efficient annotation of the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. These annotations will comprise mark-up of sections of text that discuss clinically relevant fields of importance in EBM, such as discussion of patient characteristics, interventions studied and potential sources of bias. Such annotations would make literature search and data extraction much easier for systematic reviewers, thus reducing their workload and freeing more time for them to conduct thoughtful evidence synthesis.  This will be the first in-depth exploration of crowdsourcing for EBM. We will collect annotations from workers with varying levels of expertise and cost, ranging from medical students to workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will develop and evaluate novel methods of aggregating annotations from such heterogeneous sources. And we will use the acquired manual annotations to train machine learning models that automate this markup process. Models capable of automatically identifying clinically salient text snippets in full-text articles describing clinical trials would be broadly useful for biomedical literature retrieval tasks and would have impact beyond our immediate application of EBM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to annotate clinically important sentences in full-text articles describing clinical trials Ultimately, we aim to automate such annotation, thereby enabling more efficient practice of evidence- based medicine (EBM).         ",Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities,9076888,UH2CA203711,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'demographics', 'detector', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,240650,0.020750309177273208
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,9050675,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2016,300000,0.014068092811552798
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9134899,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,334212,0.0022010223718931356
"Natural language processing for characterizing psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests the importance of understanding psychiatric illness from a dimensional rather than solely a categorical perspective. The limitations of traditional diagnostic categories motivated a major NIMH-supported effort to identify measures of psychopathology that more closely align with underlying disease biology.  At present, however, the available large clinical data sets, whether health claims, registries, or electronic health records, do not include such dimensional measures. Even with the integration of structure clinician and patient-reported outcomes, generating such cohorts could require a decade or more. Moreover, coded data does not systematically capture clinically-important concepts such as health behaviors or stressors.  While such cohorts are developed, natural language processing can facilitate the application of existing electronic health records to enable precision medicine in psychiatry. Specifically, while traditional natural language tools focus on extracting individual terms, emerging methods including those in development by the investigators allow extraction of concepts and dimensions.  The present investigation proposes to develop a toolkit for natural language processing of narrative patient notes to extract measures of psychopathology, including estimated RDoC domains. In preliminary investigations in a large health system, these tools have demonstrated both face validity and predictive validity. This toolkit also allows extraction o complex concepts from narrative notes, such as stressors and health behaviors.  In the proposed study, these natural language processing tools will be applied to a large psychiatric inpatient data set as well as a large general medical inpatient data set, to derive measures of psychopathology and other topics. The resulting measures will then be used in combination with coded data to build regression and machine-learning-based models to predict clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay and risk of readmission. The models will then be validated in independent clinical cohorts.  By combining expertise in longitudinal clinical investigation, natural language processing, and machine learning, the proposed study brings together a team with the needed skills to develop a critical toolkit for understanding health records dimensionally The resulting models can be applied to facilitate investigation of dimensions of psychopathology and related topics, allowing stratification of clinical risk to enable development of targeted interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Public health significance many aspects of psychiatric illness are not adequately captured by diagnostic codes. This study will apply natural language processing and machine learning to electronic health records from large health systems.

"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.            ",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9081760,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Population', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'Work', 'age group', 'age related', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2016,428590,-0.003149710853832814
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,9145227,R01GM097618,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'international partnership', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,539889,-0.011385743143133892
"Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for these neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage two previously developed technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS). The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be a previously developed Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), a recently developed Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated during a previous NIH-funded SBIR Phase I/II project for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. The AMP is truly unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real-time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies. With integrated measures of submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements, the Sleep Profiler is an ideal device for quantifying the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which is considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine-learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of various dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to develop a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud-based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of research participants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, clinical course, and treatment options for neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need, Advanced Brain Monitoring (Carlsbad, CA) is developing Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profilers for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS), which will provide an inexpensive, non-invasive solution combining neurocognitive, electrophysiological (EEG, ECG, EMG), and sleep-behavior assessment into a single, integrated system featuring automated scoring and classification algorithms.

"An Open Source Precision Medicine Platform for Cloud Operating Systems ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rapid improvements in DNA sequencing and synthesis have the potential to usher in a new era of precision medicine.

"Reproducibility Assessment for Multivariate Assays DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Small Business Innovation Research project addresses the problem of assessing reproducibility in analyzing high-throughput data. In feature selection for data with large numbers of features, it is well known that some features will appear to affect an outcome by chance, and that subsequent predictions based on these features may not be as successful as initial results would seem to indicate. Similarly, there are often multiple stages, and many parameters, involved in the multivariate assays de- signed to analyze high-throughput profiles. For example, good results achieved with a particular combination of settings for an instance of cross-validation may not generalize to other instances. The objective of this proposal is to extend new statistical methods for assessing reproducibility in replicate experiments to the context of machine learning, and demonstrate effectiveness in this application. The machine-learning methods to be investigated will include random forests, supervised principal components, lasso penalization and support vector machines. We will use simulated and real data from genomic applications to show the potential of this approach for providing reproducibility assessments that are not confounded with prespecified choices, for determining biologically relevant thresholds, for improving the accuracy of signal identification, and for identifying suboptimal results. Relevance. Although today's high-throughput technologies offer the possibility of revolutionizing clinical practice, the analytical tools availble for extracting information from this amount of data are not yet sufficiently developed for targeted exploration of the underlying biology. This project directly addresses the need to make what the FDA terms IVDMIA (In-Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assays) transparent, interpretable, and reproducible, and is thus an opportunity to improve analysis products and services provided to companies that identify, characterize, and validate biomarkers for clinical diagnostics and drug development decision points. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to develop a platform for biomarker discovery and integrative genomic analysis, with reproducibility assessment incorporated into multivariate assays. This will enable evaluation and improvement of approaches to detecting the biological factors that affect a particular outcome, and lead to more efficient and more effective methods for disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and therapeutic drug development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statistical models play a key role in medical research in uncovering information from data that leads to new diagnostics and therapies. However, development of standards for reliability in biomedical data mining has not kept up with the rapid pace at which new data types and modeling approaches are being devised.

"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.            ",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,8953935,R03OH010956,[' '],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2015,66904,-0.009981659594214301
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility.

"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data. This pioneering research directly impacts public health by improving the quality of care through enhanced reminder functionality in the EHRs.",A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications,8978947,K99LM011575,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Area', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Institution', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'open source', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2015,83160,0.017711228034545452
"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials. The overall aim of this project is to identify multimodal biomarkers of FTLD.",Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration,8849803,K01AG043503,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Country', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychology', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'social', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2015,128358,-0.0046532338006072425
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,8929292,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2015,132348,-0.025543542017712327

"Instrument to Co-register EEG and NIRS for Accurate Sleep Sorting DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     PROJECT SUMMARY Sleep disorders are highly prevalent and are associated with substantial adverse consequences including motor vehicle and other accidents, impaired cognition, impaired immune function, altered mood, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. The gold standard test for assessing the physiology of sleep is the polysomnogram suffers from a number of well-recognized limitations. These limitations decrease the capacity of sleep researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from sleep disorders. (PSG). Currently employed PSG technology Our long-term goal is to address the shortcomings of current PSG methodology by developing a low cost, low for automated assessment of sleep physiology. We hypothesize that this would be possible by expanding the types of brain assessments carried out to include near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) where recent evidence suggests that the low frequency hemodynamic oscillation reflect sleep stage-related changes in brain function. NIRS also simultaneously provides cerebral oxygen saturation, heart rate and breathing rate estimates. In this application, we propose to design, build, and test power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system a proof-of-principle prototype system combining diffuse optical spectroscopic, electrophysiological, and inertial . This system will have the form factor of an adhesive bandage which will disturb and limit subjects to a far lesser degree than traditional PSG systems. We will use supervised machine learning-based methods to explore NIRS features specific to sleep stages and clinically relevant events. Other innovations include recording inertial signals and incorporating adaptive signal processing in order to remove artifacts and improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR), and using commercial-off-the-shelf proximity sensor circuitry to support the NIRS front-end. measurement capabilities If successful, this project will lead to improved capacity to carry out sleep research and to detect and treat sleep disorders. The proposed methodology would test whether novel clinically relevant NIRS parameters can be explored enabling further understanding of sleep physiology. The miniaturization, low cost, and low power consumption of our new NIRS-based wireless system would pave the way for rapid adoption and deployment of these bandages for home-use in real-world settings. Given the high prevalence and substantial impairments associated with sleep disorders, this project has the potential to have a major positive impact on public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative A review carried out by the Institute of Medicine concluded that 50-70 million people in the United States suffer from a chronic disorder of sleep and wakefulness which diminishes their ability to function, adversely impacts their health, and decreases longevity. Current systems for objectively monitoring sleep physiology and diagnosing sleep disorders suffer from a number of widely-recognized shortcomings that limit the capacity of researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and sleep disorders and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from these conditions. Our long term goal is to develop a low cost, low power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system for automated assessment of sleep physiology which addresses these shortcomings. The specific objective of this proposal is to investigate the capability of a miniaturized, wireless near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) system to achieve this. As such, the proposed project has the potential to improve the lives of the millions of people suffering from sleep disorders.",Instrument to Co-register EEG and NIRS for Accurate Sleep Sorting,8930756,R21NS085818,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Apnea', 'Bandage', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lithium', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Movement', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Noise', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plethysmography', 'Polymers', 'Polysomnography', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleeplessness', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wakefulness', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'immune function', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'meetings', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'sleep onset']",NINDS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R21,2015,148458,0.009944693000581218
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,8935814,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'built environment', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'health data', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2015,155674,0.021202085527598436

"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD. This effort has significant public health implications, as it can lead to new treatment targets and result in the accurate allocation of treatment resources to those most in need.","Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1",8922958,K01MH102415,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'CNR2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corticotropin', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'New York City', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional disability', 'genetic analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'pediatric trauma', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'response', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'social', 'stress resilience', 'traumatic event', 'urinary']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2015,166237,-0.002268787428576773
"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.            ",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9032882,K01MH106710,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Surveys', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reading', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rosa', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Self-Administered', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stressful Event', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'salivary assay', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2015,166893,-0.00343950835771476
"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.                ",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9044538,K01ES026837,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,178606,0.02036707161011284
"Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses NIH's call to promote data sharing and patient privacy. A major obstacle to sharing of recorded video has been the need to protect participants' identity. Similarly, concern about stigma is a reason that many people in need of mental health services (e.g., in the military) fail to do so. We propose a system to de-identify patients and research participants in video. Face de-identification transfers facial expression automatically from source face images, which are confidential, to target face images, which are not. The system safeguards face anonymity while preserving the facial expression of the original source video. The target video then can communicate the emotion, communicative intent, pain, and neurological or physiological status of the source person without displaying the source person's face. Face de-identification would enable video archive sharing among researchers and clinicians without compromising privacy or confidentiality. Moreover, a version of this system could potentially be used to preserve privacy and anonymity in internet-based interviews. Innovation. The project has four innovations. The approach (1) Removes identity information while retaining facial dynamics; thus preserving the information value of the face to communicate emotion, pain, and related states. (2) Accommodates subtle and spontaneous facial actions, rather than imitating only some predefined molar expressions (e.g., happy or sad). (3) Requires no training steps by target persons. (4) And requires no hand annotation of video. The system is entirely automatic. Approach. The software will take as input a video with the face of a subject (source) and automatically generate or output a video with the face de-identified. The project will use new machine learning and computer vision algorithms for transferring subtle facial expression from a source subject (original video) to a target subject, using only one frontal image of the target subject. A major novelty of the approach is to make the process completely automatic. The algorithm will be validated using commercially available software for face recognition and custom software for facial expression analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sharing of video recordings for research and clinical uses would significantly contribute to scientific discovery and patient diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation. We will develop and validate a fully automatic system that preserves facial expression in video while fully protecting face identity.",Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use,8908047,R21MH099487,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informed Consent', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Source', 'Step training', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Video Recording', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'graphical user interface', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'patient privacy', 'sex', 'social stigma', 'targeted imaging', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,193512,-0.049735770155246634
"Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) present with an insidious onset and gradual loss of word finding, object naming, or word-comprehension skills which profoundly affect their verbal participation in daily activities. The overall goal of this innovative research is to take an initial step toward the creation of adaptive language prostheses that augment lexical access and word use in PPA as skills are lost. The short term objective is to determine whether individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA improve or maintain word finding skills during conversation when provided with a novel intervention tool, namely a mobile technology application called CO-CHAT that automatically presents related vocabulary to them as needed. CO-CHAT is a simulated social media app for research which creates lexical displays synthesized from a user's self-generated photos, comments from social network contacts, the device's metadata, and a curated list of key words generated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Aim 1 addresses development of the simulated social media app with NLP applications. Aim 2 proposes a research study to determine whether people with PPA can use the CO-CHAT lexical displays to improve or maintain word finding skills in conversation. Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) The number (and percentage) of target words spoken by participants during conversations will increase when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available~ (2) The number (and percentage) of questions needed by conversation partners to obtain information from participants about daily activities will decrease when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available. Participants are 10 individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA (agrammatic or semantic variants) recruited from the Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Center. A withdrawal ABAB design with intra-subject and inter-subject replication is proposed. Each participant engages in community- based activities, taking photos and sending them to a simulated social network for comment. By relying on the technology's automatic manipulation of language, photos comments then are analyzed. Related words that are mined from large lexical semantic databases are placed in the lexical displays with the original photo. Participants describe the community activities to familiar partners in 5-minute conversations without technology (baseline phase A) and with CO- CHAT (experimental phase B). Visual analysis of changes across conditions and repeated measures ANOVAs evaluate intervention effects. The proposed research addresses the need to identify effective language compensation strategies to treat individuals experiencing PPA, a relatively new diagnosis for which compensatory treatment paradigms are yet to be developed. Results will support a larger research agenda to further develop adaptive assistive technologies for intervention, and to implement outcomes-based clinical studies that determine the efficacy of a stage-based longitudinal AAC/NLP intervention for patients with PPA in order to maintain vocabulary access, communication functions and social networks with mobile technology over the course of language degeneration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The population of adults presenting with dementia syndromes and degenerative language disorders is increasing exponentially in the U.S., in the absence of clinical guidelines for effective language intervention. This research will provide evidence to support intervention standards with assistive technologies for persons with primary progressive aphasia, as well as provide scientific data to justify medical insurance reimbursement, and help family members advocate for increases in standard clinical care.",Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia,8852594,R21DC014099,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Apple', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family member', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Prosthesis', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Semantics', 'Social Network', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Withdrawal', 'alternative communication', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comprehension skill', 'computer science', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention effect', 'lexical', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'research study', 'skills', 'social', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,194301,-0.000397813322423553
"A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last decade has seen explosive growth of online social networks (OSNs), which are now a pervasive part of everyday life for many people. ""Big data"" analyses of OSNs have enormous potential to enable new discoveries and applications in public health. For example we may soon be able to study how mental health indicators vary over time and between communities and regions; how major events like disasters and mass shootings affect community mental health; and potentially even use social media for individual-level screening and diagnosis. But in order to do this effectively, psychologists need to know how to make sense of vast amounts of digital records of raw behavior. That will require interdisciplinary collaborations between psychology and computer science to create new tools and methods for automated analyses of mental health variables in large and complex datasets. The goal of this project is to develop new metrics for doing large-scale, ""big data"" mental health research on Twitter, a popular online social network service with a large and diverse user base in the United States that makes most user-generated content publicly available. We are particularly interested in how Twitter data can be used to draw inferences about users' personality traits (which are indicative of risk and vulnerability), emotions, and clinical symptoms. To date, researchers studying mental health on Twitter have focused on a small number of metrics which often differ from study to study and are not always well-validated. We do not yet have a unified, comprehensive understanding of how mental health characteristics can be measured and studied online. Our project has three goals. First, we will gather data from a very large, representative sample of American Twitter users to map out what meaningful metrics can be derived from Twitter data. What can be reliably measured, and how are different kinds of metrics related to each other? By studying relationships and overlaps among these variables, we expect to identify a key set of online metrics that can be used to characterize important psychological differences among users. Second, we will recruit a sample of Twitter users to complete standardized assessments of personality, emotion, and clinical symptoms. We will look to see what kinds of online behaviors are reliable and valid markers of these psychological variables. Third, to demonstrate the utility of these markers we will monitor millions of Twitter accounts around the country for one year to measure how one specific kind of community trauma, mass shootings, affects indicators of personality, emotion, and mental health.

"Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study focuses on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) because, left untreated, it is the leading cause of blindness in the adult US population over 50. The goals of this program are twofold. First, the focus is to develop new screening tools to detect individuals with the intermediate stage of AMD, that are otherwise asymptomatic for vision loss, at a stage where they can be referred to a clinician for treatment and follow up, and when vision more likely can be preserved. The second goal is to develop Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA) tools that help characterize Geographic Atrophy (GA), for which novel treatments are being investigated. We are developing data-driven algorithms for AMD screening which leverage recent advances in machine learning and machine intelligence and do not rely on detecting and counting or sizing drusen (a procedure which can be error prone). Instead, our method analyzes a fundus image as a whole using an image classification paradigm, and may also exploit ancillary patient information. Our goal is to use the AREDS dbGaP that includes thousands of images from hundreds of patients and offers a unique opportunity to develop and test these algorithms on a scale that has not previously been possible. Our team consists of the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, which will serve as the clinical analysis test site, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which will conduct the automated screening software tool analysis, development and testing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are twofold. First, in order to work towards improving outcome, our goal is to develop novel software screening tools that allow for the automated detection of individuals with the intermediate stage AMD so that they may be referred to clinicians for follow up and treatment at an earlier stage than would otherwise occur. Second, we will develop new tools to characterize the evolution of GA, for which new treatments are being developed and tested. Our project is a secondary study on the AREDS dbGaP, which will be leveraged for the development and validation of these new algorithms on a scale never before attempted.                ",Automated Retinal Analysis for Detection of Age Related Macular Degeneration,8826350,R21EY024310,"['Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biotechnology', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Cataract', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Discipline', 'Drusen', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myopia', 'National Eye Institute', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Pigmentation physiologic function', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'age related', 'bioimaging', 'computer program', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'geographic atrophy', 'improved', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'tool']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,215393,-0.023779846755111137
"Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports  Abstract Communication of clinically important follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. The absence of an automated system to identify and track radiology follow-up recommendations is an important barrier to ensuring timely follow-up of patients, especially for non-acute but potentially life threatening and unexpected findings. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to extract clinically important recommendation information from free-text radiology reports. Each radiology report will be preprocessed at the structural, syntactic, and semantic level to generate features that will be used to extract the boundaries of sentences that include recommendation information as well as the details of reason for recommendation, requested imaging test, and recommendation time frame. We will use a large corpus of free-text radiology reports represented by a mixture of modalities (e.g., radiography, computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) from three different institutions. Using this dataset we will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create a multi- institutional radiology report corpus annotated for clinically important recommendation information; Aim 2. Develop a novel NLP system to extract clinically important recommendations in radiology reports. The proposed research is innovative because it will generate a new text processing approach that can be used to flag reports visually and electronically so that separate workflow processes can be initiated to reduce the chance that necessary investigations or interventions suggested in the report are missed by clinicians. The proposed set of tools will be disseminated to the biomedical informatics community as open source tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Communication of recommendations for necessary investigations and interventions when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. When recommendations are not systematically identified and promptly communicated to referrers, poor patient outcomes can result. We propose to build natural language processing tools to automatically extract clinically important recommendation information from radiology reports.                ",Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports,8804856,R21EB016872,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidental Findings', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Lung nodule', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Washington', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer care', 'care delivery', 'design', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,217500,-0.003183158840353953
"Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excess body fat is a key underlying factor in the development of numerous chronic diseases, including type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The AMA recently declared that obesity, itself, is a disease. Most epidemiologic studies utilize Body Mass Index (BMI) to classify people as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese because it is a convenient and simple method that has been shown to correlate with disease risk. Since the majority of the health risks associated with obesity are more directly linked to an overabundance of body fat than weight, measuring body fat is essential for more precise guidelines. However, accurate methods of assessing body fat are expensive, inconvenient, and require immobile equipment. Consequently, the AMA has called for more cost effective and convenient methods to assess body composition to assist doctors in their assessment and treatment. Virtual modeling of humans in particular has provided ways to scan and analyze the body and its motion. Supervised Machine Learning (SML), a sub-field of artificial intelligence, has made great progress in taking measured data to infer new relationships. It is our belief that virtual modeling and SML can provide the techniques necessary to conveniently and accurately calculate the percentage of body fat (%BF) and to provide new tools in treating obesity based on body shapes. The project will develop a system that uses commercially available depth cameras such as the Microsoft Kinect(r) to capture the surface of the human body. This will be accomplished by developing a new algorithm to perform deformable registration of several RGB-Depth views of the body. A new algorithm that uses SML will be developed to calculate percentage body fat using the surface data. The system will be trained and validated by collecting data from a number of subjects. The surface captured will be used to explore the role of visual body representation in motivation and adherence. The developed systems can be implemented in clinical or personal settings and be utilized as a public health research tool and deployed widely given the low-cost of the hardware required. In addition to the immediate impact that the system will have on managing obesity, the project will have a broad impact on a number of areas. A large database of such shapes captured over time may lead to ways to predict how an individual's body shape will change given a particular intervention. Certain medical conditions that result in body shape change, such as those involving lymphatic circulations, may be diagnosed and tracked more easily. Growth patterns of children may be tracked by change of body shapes. Further research can be conducted to determine the effect of body shape on %BF using data mining techniques.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop a new method to capture the 3D surface and shape of a human body and a new method to use these data to calculate percent body fat. By making these tools widely available and economical, the proposed approach has the potential for major contributions in the assessment and treatment of obesity.        ",Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models,8970310,R21HL124443,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Belief', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body Surface', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equipment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Muscle', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plethysmography', 'Population Study', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Self Perception', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underweight', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Weight', 'Weights and Measures', 'base', 'body density', 'body volume', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder risk', 'lymphatic circulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'tool', 'virtual', 'weight loss intervention']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,227680,-0.006359476641714077
"A Visual Assessment System for Retinal Function/Drug Discovery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preclinical evaluation of treatment strategies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases is highly dependent on mouse models. Classical methods to assess the visual function of animals, such as electroretinogram (ERG), which measures electrical responses in the retina, do not address connections between the eye and brain or visual perception by the visual system. This often raises concerns regarding the functional relevance of the therapeutic benefit. Difficulty in assessing visual perception and related behavior in mice and rats, largely due to their subtle visual behavior cues and the lack of adequate measuring devices, presents a critical barrier to the application of mouse models for evaluating treatment efficacy of new drugs, and for scaling up for behavior phenotyping to screen genetic vision defects. Pupillary light reflex (PLR) and optokinetic reflex (OKR) tests are useful methods in clinics for assessing human visual responses and perception. However, such tests have been difficult to conduct in rodents because current rodent visual testing methods or devices either do not allow accurate quantitative assessment for PLR or OKR or use subjective measures to score visual responses. To address these challenges, we propose to advance the technology by designing an easy-to-use automated platform that employs an eye/pupil tracking device equipped with a computer vision system (chiefly the interactive tracking system) for unambiguous objective scoring of visual responses. Our proposed new device will allow real-time quantitative and accurate assessment of rodent visual function including light responses, visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. The novelty of our system also lies in that it does not require complicated calibration procedures needed in commonly used human eye tracking. Rather than precisely measuring the extent of eye turning (or orientation), we propose to detect the signature eye movement in accordance with the speed and direction of visual stimuli. The system will be validated using normal wildtype mice and mouse models of retinal neurodegeneration known to develop visual behavior changes in the parameters mentioned above. Although rodent eye tracking has been investigated before, this proposed visual assessment system would be the first commercially viable product that uses an eye/pupil tracking device to automatically assess visual perception in rodents. The combined PLR and OKR tests and vastly simplified and automated quantification methods will also provide the first scalable behavior platform for phenotyping and drug discovery in the vision research area. In the future, this technology has the potential of being expanded to measure responses from various visual stimuli. This may translate into broader applications for evaluating brain diseases that afflict the visual pathways. This platform for mouse visual behavior assessment will therefore greatly facilitate drug discovery and development aimed at preventing and slowing vision loss or restoring sight, helping to combat devastating blinding conditions such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the current proposal is to design and develop an automated system for the measure of rodent (mice and rats) light response, visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity. The system will apply human eye/pupil tracking techniques for objective and unambiguous evaluation of light response and visual perception. This platform will provide a powerful tool for phenotypic studies as well as for discovery of new drugs that can prevent or restore sight caused by blinding conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma.                ",A Visual Assessment System for Retinal Function/Drug Discovery,8980787,R41EY025913,"['Address', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Coma', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Cues', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electroretinography', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Eye diseases', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Screening', 'Glaucoma', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Procedures', 'Pupil', 'Pupil light reflex', 'Rattus', 'Reflex action', 'Research Institute', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Rodent', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual system structure', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'combat', 'commercialization', 'computer generated', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'genetic approach', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'liquid crystal', 'mouse model', 'new technology', 'performance tests', 'photoreceptor degeneration', 'preclinical evaluation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'scale up', 'success', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'treatment strategy', 'visual performance', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,"AFASCI, INC.",R41,2015,233235,-0.09228253381057576
"Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For many years, there has been a concerted effort to automate the analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) rhythms. However, despite significant advances in biomedical signal analysis, there has not been any significant improvement in automated decision support systems. FHR monitoring is now ubiquitous throughout delivery rooms, especially using the non-invasive Doppler monitor, but also using the fetal scalp electrode. Physician classification of fetal heart rate patterns is known to be a non-trivial problem because of significant inter and intra-observer variability of diagnosis. This has led to a marked increase in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby increasing risk to the fetus and mother in many cases. This has further motivated the machine learning community to automate the classification procedure in the interest of accuracy and consistency as well as robustness with respect to noise. Usual approaches to this involve some type of supervised classification procedure, where the algorithm output on training data is compared with a ""gold-standard"" physician classification, followed by testing and validation on new datasets. However, since physician classification can be unreliable in the presence of the aforementioned diagnostic variability, as well as significant tracing noise, we propose the use of unsupervised algorithms to cluster FHR data records into clinically useful categories. We use nonparametric Bayes theory and Markov-time-dependence models for the evolution of feature sequences to propose methods that will achieve improved accuracy. The methods involve extraction of feature sequences from FHR time series data, which are modeled as samples from finite or infinite Dirichlet mixture models. We then use Gibbs sampling to obtain the cluster probabilities for each dataset. Clustering outcomes are compared against direct physician diagnosis and our current results are seen to be in broad agreement with them, while still giving new information on the character of different sub-groups of FHR records. With the proposed research, further gains in classification performance will be made.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fetal heart rate monitoring is now commonly used during childbirth and, at present, physicians read and interpret these data to classify fetal heart rate patterns and make sure that the baby is not in distress during the course of labor. However, there is great variability in how individual doctors interpret the tracings and this has led increases in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby potentially increasing risk to both mothers and babies. Thus there has been a concerted effort from the machine learning community to develop an accurate automatic reading and classification procedure so that correct interpretation of fetal heart rates during labor is more diagnostic and consistent.            ",Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring,8816208,R21HD080025,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Categories', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Delivery Rooms', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Fetal Heart', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Freedom', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mothers', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Umbilical cord structure', 'Uncertainty', 'Uterine Contraction', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'fetal', 'improved', 'interest', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'stem', 'theories', 'vector']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2015,234571,-0.00011713732924761496
"Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent statistics indicate that worldwide almost 234 million major surgical procedures are performed each year with the rates of major postsurgical complications (PSCs) range from 3% to 16% and rates of permanent disability or death range from 0.4% to 0.8%. Early detection of PSCs is crucial since early intervention could be lifesaving. Meanwhile, with the rapid adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the accelerated advance of health information technology (HIT), detection of PSCs by applying advanced analytics on EMRs makes it possible for near real-time PSC surveillance. We have developed a rule-based PSC surveillance system to detect most frequent colorectal PSCs near real-time from EMRs where a pattern-based natural language processing (NLP) engine is used to extract PSC related information from text and a set of expert rules is used to detect PSCs. Two challenges are identified. First, it is very challenging to integrate a diverse set of relevant data using expert rules. In the past, probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian Network which can integrate a diverse set of relevant data have become popular in clinical decision support and disease outbreak surveillance. Can we implement probabilistic approaches for PSC surveillance? Secondly, a large portion of the clinical information is embedded in text and it has been quite expensive to manually obtain the patterns used in the NLP system since it requires team effort of subject matter experts and NLP specialists. In the research field, statistical NLP has been quite popular. However, decision making in clinical practice demands tractable evidences while models for statistical NLP are not human interpretable. Can we incorporate statistical NLP to accelerate the NLP knowledge engineering process? We hypothesize that a probabilistic approach for PSC surveillance can be developed for improved case detection which can integrate multiple evidences from structured as well as unstructured EMR data. We also hypothesize that empirical NLP can accelerate the knowledge engineering process needed for building pattern- based NLP systems used in practice. Specific aims include: i) developing and evaluating an innovative Bayesian PSC surveillance system that incorporates evidences from both structured and unstructured EMR data; and ii) incorporating and evaluating statistical NLP in accelerating the NLP knowledge engineering process of pattern-based NLP for PSC surveillance. Given the significance of HIT, our study results will advance the science in developing practical NLP systems that can be translated to meet NLP needs in health care practice. Additionally, given the significance of PSCs, our study results will address significant patient safety and quality issues in surgical practice. Utilizing automated methods to detect postsurgical complications will enable early detection of complications compared to other methods and therefore have great potential of improving patient safety and health care quality while reducing cost. The results could lead to large scale PSC surveillance and quality improvement towards safer and better health care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid growth in the clinical implementation of large electronic medical records (EMRs) has led to unprecedented opportunities to use EMRs for clinical practice and research. We explore the use of EMRs for near real-time postsurgical complication surveillance with the aim of improving health care quality and reducing health care cost through enhanced analytics towards surgical excellence.                ",Secondary use of EMRs for surgical complication surveillance,8798027,R01EB019403,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Ileus', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Wound Infection', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'disability', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'statistics']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2015,299888,0.014068092811552798
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.            ",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9004826,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,319087,0.0022010223718931356
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health. Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases.

"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.            ",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,8964138,R01GM097618,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'natural language', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2015,608132,-0.011385743143133892

"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.            ",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,8774800,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2014,73173,-0.0005722916132125716
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications  PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develop a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials.

"Reproducibility Assessment for Multivariate Assays  Project Summary. This Small Business Innovation Research project addresses the problem of assessing reproducibility in analyzing high-throughput data. In feature selection for data with large numbers of fea- tures, it is well known that some features will appear to affect an outcome by chance, and that subsequent predictions based on these features may not be as successful as initial results would seem to indicate. Similarly, there are often multiple stages, and many parameters, involved in the multivariate assays de- signed to analyze high-throughput profiles. For example, good results achieved with a particular combina- tion of settings for an instance of cross-validation may not generalize to other instances. The objective of this proposal is to extend new statistical methods for assessing reproducibility in replicate experiments to the context of machine learning, and demonstrate effectiveness in this application. The machine-learning methods to be investigated will include random forests, supervised principal components, lasso penal- ization and support vector machines. We will use simulated and real data from genomic applications to show the potential of this approach for providing reproducibility assessments that are not confounded with prespecified choices, for determining biologically relevant thresholds, for improving the accuracy of signal identification, and for identifying suboptimal results. Relevance. Although today's high-throughput technologies offer the possibility of revolutionizing clinical practice, the analytical tools available for extracting information from this amount of data are not yet sufficiently developed for targeted exploration of the underlying biology. This project directly addresses the need to make what the FDA terms IVDMIA (In-Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assays) transparent, interpretable, and reproducible, and is thus an opportunity to improve analysis products and services provided to companies that identify, characterize, and validate biomarkers for clinical diagnostics and drug development decision points. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to develop a platform for biomarker discovery and integrative genomic analysis, with reproducibility assessment incorporated into multivariate assays. This will enable evaluation and improvement of approaches to detecting the biological factors that affect a particular outcome, and lead to more efficient and more effective methods for disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and therapeutic drug development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statistical models play a key role in medical research in uncovering information from data that leads to new diagnostics and therapies. However, development of standards for reliability in biomedical data mining has not kept up with the rapid pace at which new data types and modeling approaches are being devised. This proposal is for new methods for quantifying reproducibility in biomedical data analyses that will have a far-reaching impact on public health by streamlining protocols, reducing costs and offering more effective clinical support systems.            ",Reproducibility Assessment for Multivariate Assays,8647816,R43GM109503,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Support System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug development', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel diagnostics', 'public health relevance', 'research study']",NIGMS,INSILICOS,R43,2014,131071,-0.025499326932206225
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications.              PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,8700987,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2014,132121,-0.025543542017712327
"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current approaches to medical education produce new physicians with insufficient clinical competency to practice effectively with limited supervision, which has serious implications for patient outcomes during hospital off hours. Up to 70% of patients admitted to a hospital are admitted on nights or weekends, when staffing is low and residents may be in charge of patient care. Off-hours care is linked to an increase in medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates. Negative patient outcomes during off hours are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of residents in their first postgraduate year. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Develop a scoring algorithm that automatically evaluates students' written justifications of diagnostic strategy. 2) Build a taxonomy of strategy failures from students' diagnostic justifications. 3) Work closely with SIUSOM and other medical schools contemplating the addition of diagnostic reasoning assessment to their curriculum. Phase II will focus on additional specific aims: 4) Develop an application based on the Phase I proof of concept with refined algorithms for scoring, categorizing reasoning failures and targeted remediation. 5) Evaluate the learning application for usability, acceptance via focus groups, and effectiveness via a limited field trial with students at SIUSOM. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: During hospital off hours negative patient outcomes including medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of first year residents. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.            ",Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition,8703305,R41GM108104,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Competence', 'Consult', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Incubators', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Plant Roots', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Residencies', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'case-based', 'essays', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical malpractice', 'medical schools', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'remediation', 'research and development', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'success', 'technology development', 'theories', 'undergraduate medical education', 'usability']",NIGMS,"PARALLEL CONSULTING, LLC",R41,2014,144721,0.002043048747488388
"HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research     DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic rise in obesity and related chronic diseases in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. My overarching career goal is to contribute to the improvement of population health by conducting research in social determinants of health and developing new methodologies to address multidimensional research questions. The development of the Hashtag Health data repository will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of social media data to capture social and cultural processes with potential impact on health.            ",HashtagHealth: A Social Media Big Data Resource for Neighborhood Effects Research,8828979,K01ES025433,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Advocacy', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Communications Media', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Food Chain', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Database', 'Poverty', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fast food', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'news', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'screening', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2014,155674,0.021202085527598436
"The Cardiovascular Research Grid DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The Cardiovascular Research Grid (CVRG) Project is an R24 resource supporting the informatics needs of the cardiovascular (CV) research community. The CVRG Project has developed and deployed unique core technology for management and analysis of CV data that is being used in a broad range of Driving Biomedical Projects (DBFs). This includes: a) tools for storing and managing different types of biomedical data; b) methods for securing the data; c) tools for querying combinations of these data so that users may mine their data for new knowledge; d) new statistical learning methods for biomarker discovery; e) novel tools that analyze image data on heart shape and motion to discover biomarkers that are indicative of disease; f) tools for managing, analyzing, and annotating ECG data.

"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD. This effort has significant public health implications, as it can lead to new treatment targets and result in the accurate allocation of treatment resources to those most in need.            ","Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1",8767056,K01MH102415,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corticotropin', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'New York City', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional disability', 'genetic analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'pediatric trauma', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'response', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'social', 'stress resilience', 'urinary']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2014,167317,-0.002268787428576773
"Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses NIH's call to promote data sharing and patient privacy. A major obstacle to sharing of recorded video has been the need to protect participants' identity. Similarly, concern about stigma is a reason that many people in need of mental health services (e.g., in the military) fail to do so. We propose a system to de-identify patients and research participants in video. Face de-identification transfers facial expression automatically from source face images, which are confidential, to target face images, which are not. The system safeguards face anonymity while preserving the facial expression of the original source video. The target video then can communicate the emotion, communicative intent, pain, and neurological or physiological status of the source person without displaying the source person's face. Face de-identification would enable video archive sharing among researchers and clinicians without compromising privacy or confidentiality. Moreover, a version of this system could potentially be used to preserve privacy and anonymity in internet-based interviews. Innovation. The project has four innovations. The approach (1) Removes identity information while retaining facial dynamics; thus preserving the information value of the face to communicate emotion, pain, and related states. (2) Accommodates subtle and spontaneous facial actions, rather than imitating only some predefined molar expressions (e.g., happy or sad). (3) Requires no training steps by target persons. (4) And requires no hand annotation of video. The system is entirely automatic. Approach. The software will take as input a video with the face of a subject (source) and automatically generate or output a video with the face de-identified. The project will use new machine learning and computer vision algorithms for transferring subtle facial expression from a source subject (original video) to a target subject, using only one frontal image of the target subject. A major novelty of the approach is to make the process completely automatic. The algorithm will be validated using commercially available software for face recognition and custom software for facial expression analysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sharing of video recordings for research and clinical uses would significantly contribute to scientific discovery and patient diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation. We will develop and validate a fully automatic system that preserves facial expression in video while fully protecting face identity.            ",Face De-Identification for Research and Clinical Use,8772435,R21MH099487,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informed Consent', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Source', 'Step training', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Video Recording', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'graphical user interface', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'patient privacy', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'social stigma', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,194915,-0.049735770155246634
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,8775015,U54EB020405,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'models and simulation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2014,209258,0.02111009090826029
"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research.

"Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) present with an insidious onset and gradual loss of word finding, object naming, or word-comprehension skills which profoundly affect their verbal participation in daily activities. The overall goal of this innovative research is to take an initial step toward the creation of adaptive language prostheses that augment lexical access and word use in PPA as skills are lost. The short term objective is to determine whether individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA improve or maintain word finding skills during conversation when provided with a novel intervention tool, namely a mobile technology application called CO-CHAT that automatically presents related vocabulary to them as needed. CO-CHAT is a simulated social media app for research which creates lexical displays synthesized from a user's self-generated photos, comments from social network contacts, the device's metadata, and a curated list of key words generated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Aim 1 addresses development of the simulated social media app with NLP applications. Aim 2 proposes a research study to determine whether people with PPA can use the CO-CHAT lexical displays to improve or maintain word finding skills in conversation. Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) The number (and percentage) of target words spoken by participants during conversations will increase when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available~ (2) The number (and percentage) of questions needed by conversation partners to obtain information from participants about daily activities will decrease when the CO-CHAT lexical displays are available. Participants are 10 individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA (agrammatic or semantic variants) recruited from the Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Center. A withdrawal ABAB design with intra-subject and inter-subject replication is proposed. Each participant engages in community- based activities, taking photos and sending them to a simulated social network for comment. By relying on the technology's automatic manipulation of language, photos comments then are analyzed. Related words that are mined from large lexical semantic databases are placed in the lexical displays with the original photo. Participants describe the community activities to familiar partners in 5-minute conversations without technology (baseline phase A) and with CO- CHAT (experimental phase B). Visual analysis of changes across conditions and repeated measures ANOVAs evaluate intervention effects. The proposed research addresses the need to identify effective language compensation strategies to treat individuals experiencing PPA, a relatively new diagnosis for which compensatory treatment paradigms are yet to be developed. Results will support a larger research agenda to further develop adaptive assistive technologies for intervention, and to implement outcomes-based clinical studies that determine the efficacy of a stage-based longitudinal AAC/NLP intervention for patients with PPA in order to maintain vocabulary access, communication functions and social networks with mobile technology over the course of language degeneration.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The population of adults presenting with dementia syndromes and degenerative language disorders is increasing exponentially in the U.S., in the absence of clinical guidelines for effective language intervention. This research will provide evidence to support intervention standards with assistive technologies for persons with primary progressive aphasia, as well as provide scientific data to justify medical insurance reimbursement, and help family members advocate for increases in standard clinical care.            ",Co-construction of lexica in primary progressive aphasia,8764466,R21DC014099,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Apple', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication Aids for Disabled', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family member', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Prosthesis', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Semantics', 'Simulate', 'Social Network', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Withdrawal', 'alternative communication', 'base', 'clinical care', 'computer science', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention effect', 'lexical', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'social', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,234765,-0.000397813322423553
"Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports  Abstract Communication of clinically important follow-up recommendations when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. The absence of an automated system to identify and track radiology follow-up recommendations is an important barrier to ensuring timely follow-up of patients, especially for non-acute but potentially life threatening and unexpected findings. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to extract clinically important recommendation information from free-text radiology reports. Each radiology report will be preprocessed at the structural, syntactic, and semantic level to generate features that will be used to extract the boundaries of sentences that include recommendation information as well as the details of reason for recommendation, requested imaging test, and recommendation time frame. We will use a large corpus of free-text radiology reports represented by a mixture of modalities (e.g., radiography, computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) from three different institutions. Using this dataset we will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1. Create a multi- institutional radiology report corpus annotated for clinically important recommendation information; Aim 2. Develop a novel NLP system to extract clinically important recommendations in radiology reports. The proposed research is innovative because it will generate a new text processing approach that can be used to flag reports visually and electronically so that separate workflow processes can be initiated to reduce the chance that necessary investigations or interventions suggested in the report are missed by clinicians. The proposed set of tools will be disseminated to the biomedical informatics community as open source tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Communication of recommendations for necessary investigations and interventions when abnormalities are identified on imaging studies is prone to error. When recommendations are not systematically identified and promptly communicated to referrers, poor patient outcomes can result. We propose to build natural language processing tools to automatically extract clinically important recommendation information from radiology reports.                ",Using NLP to Extract Clinically Important Recommendations from Radiology Reports,8635902,R21EB016872,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidental Findings', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Lung nodule', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Washington', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer care', 'care delivery', 'design', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2014,257300,-0.003183158840353953
"Instrument to Co-register EEG and NIRS for Accurate Sleep Sorting     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     PROJECT SUMMARY Sleep disorders are highly prevalent and are associated with substantial adverse consequences including motor vehicle and other accidents, impaired cognition, impaired immune function, altered mood, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. The gold standard test for assessing the physiology of sleep is the polysomnogram suffers from a number of well-recognized limitations. These limitations decrease the capacity of sleep researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from sleep disorders. (PSG). Currently employed PSG technology Our long-term goal is to address the shortcomings of current PSG methodology by developing a low cost, low for automated assessment of sleep physiology. We hypothesize that this would be possible by expanding the types of brain assessments carried out to include near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) where recent evidence suggests that the low frequency hemodynamic oscillation reflect sleep stage-related changes in brain function. NIRS also simultaneously provides cerebral oxygen saturation, heart rate and breathing rate estimates. In this application, we propose to design, build, and test power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system a proof-of-principle prototype system combining diffuse optical spectroscopic, electrophysiological, and inertial . This system will have the form factor of an adhesive bandage which will disturb and limit subjects to a far lesser degree than traditional PSG systems. We will use supervised machine learning-based methods to explore NIRS features specific to sleep stages and clinically relevant events. Other innovations include recording inertial signals and incorporating adaptive signal processing in order to remove artifacts and improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR), and using commercial-off-the-shelf proximity sensor circuitry to support the NIRS front-end. measurement capabilities If successful, this project will lead to improved capacity to carry out sleep research and to detect and treat sleep disorders. The proposed methodology would test whether novel clinically relevant NIRS parameters can be explored enabling further understanding of sleep physiology. The miniaturization, low cost, and low power consumption of our new NIRS-based wireless system would pave the way for rapid adoption and deployment of these bandages for home-use in real-world settings. Given the high prevalence and substantial impairments associated with sleep disorders, this project has the potential to have a major positive impact on public health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative A review carried out by the Institute of Medicine concluded that 50-70 million people in the United States suffer from a chronic disorder of sleep and wakefulness which diminishes their ability to function, adversely impacts their health, and decreases longevity. Current systems for objectively monitoring sleep physiology and diagnosing sleep disorders suffer from a number of widely-recognized shortcomings that limit the capacity of researchers to make advances in understanding sleep and sleep disorders and diminish the capacity of clinicians to detect and treat patients suffering from these conditions. Our long term goal is to develop a low cost, low power, low noise, ultra-miniaturized, wireless system for automated assessment of sleep physiology which addresses these shortcomings. The specific objective of this proposal is to investigate the capability of a miniaturized, wireless near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) system to achieve this. As such, the proposed project has the potential to improve the lives of the millions of people suffering from sleep disorders.            ",Instrument to Co-register EEG and NIRS for Accurate Sleep Sorting,8771722,R21NS085818,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Apnea', 'Bandage', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lithium', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Movement', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Noise', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plethysmography', 'Polymers', 'Polysomnography', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleeplessness', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wakefulness', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'immune function', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'meetings', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'sleep onset']",NINDS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R21,2014,265759,0.009944693000581218
"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"A Software Platform for Sensor-based Movement Disorder Recognition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this SBIR project is to develop a pre-commercial prototype system capable of continuously monitoring involuntary movement disorders from a wide spectrum of neurological conditions. The impact of this innovation will enhance the availability of advanced brain and behavior research tools [PA- 11-134] by providing a continuous means of tracking the presence and severity of movement disorders during normal daily activities. This project will transform our unique movement disorder recognition algorithms into custom software that analyzes movement disorders for specific neurological conditions. The information obtained from body worn sensors will provide an accurate and objective means for assessing the complex and changeable nature of movement disorders. This goal cannot by realized using the current method of self-report questionnaires.  The research strategy for Phase I will establish the merit and feasibility of this effort by developing an Application Generation (AG) software platform using a framework of configurable signal processing modules to generate custom applications for movement disorder analysis (Aim 1). This approach reduces the effort and enhances the flexibility of designing and testing software solutions for these applications. The AG Platform will be developed using C++ software to implement signal processing and machine-learning software modules that operate within a knowledge-based framework that we have previously developed. In Aim 2 we will utilize the AG platform to generate movement disorder analysis software to evaluate a challenging test-case application: freezing-of-gait in Parkinson's disease (PD). The goal is to attain performance metrics for freezing that are comparable to those we have achieved for tremor and dyskinesia in previous efforts.  Phase II will refine the capabilities of the AG platform developed in Phase I. We will augment it with the means to automatically design and train the machine learning algorithms, improve the user-interface, and provide options for viewing and summarizing the results. The improved AG platform will be used to develop customized disorder-analysis software that encompasses the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD (e.g. dystonia, bradykinesia, Parkinsonian gait, tremor, dyskinesia), as well as for other neurological condition, such as Essential Tremor (ET). Firmware will be developed for each custom application to efficiently integrate the analytic software with our existing Trigno wireless sensor data acquisition hardware, which needs to be streamlined for this application. This combined system will be evaluated under research use-case scenarios in Neurology. Phase II will deliver an ambulatory Movement Disorder Monitoring system that not only succeeds in providing state-of-the-art monitoring solutions for PD and Essential Tremor, but has proven technology to develop monitoring solutions for a wide variety of neurological conditions. Future development will transfer this technology to a clinical version of this system.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project is intended to improve the accuracy and reduce the burden of researchers and clinicians when assessing motor outcomes for patients with involuntary movement disorders. The proposed technology will provide a means for evaluating new treatment options, and expedite the delivery of care. The attainment of these goals should increase the effectiveness of research, the time required for these research advancements to reach the consumer, and help control the rising costs of clinical care among the estimated 45 million Americans who have neurological disorders resulting in involuntary movements. The resulting improvements in motor function will ultimately lead to greater independence and productivity for this growing segment of the population.

"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health.                  Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8708209,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,535841,-0.0007490176827851874

"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials.

"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research. Computerized procedures will be developed to reduce the labor associated with screening nonrandomized studies for inclusion in reviews.",Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence,8484438,R00LM010943,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Health', 'Human', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized', 'design', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'screening', 'systematic review', 'vector']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2013,202118,0.02194929344301222
"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"A Software Platform for Sensor-based Movement Disorder Recognition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this SBIR project is to develop a pre-commercial prototype system capable of continuously monitoring involuntary movement disorders from a wide spectrum of neurological conditions. The impact of this innovation will enhance the availability of advanced brain and behavior research tools [PA- 11-134] by providing a continuous means of tracking the presence and severity of movement disorders during normal daily activities. This project will transform our unique movement disorder recognition algorithms into custom software that analyzes movement disorders for specific neurological conditions. The information obtained from body worn sensors will provide an accurate and objective means for assessing the complex and changeable nature of movement disorders. This goal cannot by realized using the current method of self-report questionnaires.  The research strategy for Phase I will establish the merit and feasibility of this effort by developing an Application Generation (AG) software platform using a framework of configurable signal processing modules to generate custom applications for movement disorder analysis (Aim 1). This approach reduces the effort and enhances the flexibility of designing and testing software solutions for these applications. The AG Platform will be developed using C++ software to implement signal processing and machine-learning software modules that operate within a knowledge-based framework that we have previously developed. In Aim 2 we will utilize the AG platform to generate movement disorder analysis software to evaluate a challenging test-case application: freezing-of-gait in Parkinson's disease (PD). The goal is to attain performance metrics for freezing that are comparable to those we have achieved for tremor and dyskinesia in previous efforts.  Phase II will refine the capabilities of the AG platform developed in Phase I. We will augment it with the means to automatically design and train the machine learning algorithms, improve the user-interface, and provide options for viewing and summarizing the results. The improved AG platform will be used to develop customized disorder-analysis software that encompasses the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD (e.g. dystonia, bradykinesia, Parkinsonian gait, tremor, dyskinesia), as well as for other neurological condition, such as Essential Tremor (ET). Firmware will be developed for each custom application to efficiently integrate the analytic software with our existing Trigno wireless sensor data acquisition hardware, which needs to be streamlined for this application. This combined system will be evaluated under research use-case scenarios in Neurology. Phase II will deliver an ambulatory Movement Disorder Monitoring system that not only succeeds in providing state-of-the-art monitoring solutions for PD and Essential Tremor, but has proven technology to develop monitoring solutions for a wide variety of neurological conditions. Future development will transfer this technology to a clinical version of this system.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project is intended to improve the accuracy and reduce the burden of researchers and clinicians when assessing motor outcomes for patients with involuntary movement disorders. The proposed technology will provide a means for evaluating new treatment options, and expedite the delivery of care. The attainment of these goals should increase the effectiveness of research, the time required for these research advancements to reach the consumer, and help control the rising costs of clinical care among the estimated 45 million Americans who have neurological disorders resulting in involuntary movements. The resulting improvements in motor function will ultimately lead to greater independence and productivity for this growing segment of the population.            ",A Software Platform for Sensor-based Movement Disorder Recognition,8521782,R43NS083098,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bradykinesia', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Dystonia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Essential Tremor', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Sector', 'Health Professional', 'Home environment', 'Involuntary Movements', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Miniaturization', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Video Recording', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'Writing', 'advanced system', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'care delivery', 'clinical care', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disorder control', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'motor disorder', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel therapeutics', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool']",NINDS,"ALTEC, INC.",R43,2013,424766,0.0019322746393441103
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health.                  Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8578484,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2013,590023,-0.0007490176827851874

"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research. Computerized procedures will be developed to reduce the labor associated with screening nonrandomized studies for inclusion in reviews.",Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence,8471822,R00LM010943,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Health', 'Human', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized', 'design', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'systematic review', 'vector']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2012,224100,0.02194929344301222
"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach  Abstract The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application. The study design is prospective observational study. Scope is limited to cancer patients. There are three specific aims for this project. The first aim is to identify concepts that overlap between the electronic medical record's (EMR) clinical notes and the free text of clinical trial announcements. The PI will use the concepts to develop mapping frames that connect concepts in the text of trial announcements to those found in clinical notes in the medical record. When he has the mapping frames he will build the NLP module for the application. In the software development work he will utilize as many publicly available software components as possible. He will experiment with UIMA, GATE, MetaMap, Stanford Parser, NegEx algorithm and others. The PI will develop the tool around the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System knowledgebase. He will use Java for programming. The second aim is to create an algorithm that automatically generates questions to request information directly from the patient if the information is not available or accessible in the records. The third aim is to evaluate the in-vitro, laboratory performance of the application. For performance evaluation purposes the PI will recruit cancer care specialists to generate the gold standard lists of eligible clinical trials for study patients. He will publicly release the developed code at the end of the grant period. This K99/R00 project will serve the foundation for future R01 grant applications. The PI is fully committed to become faculty in the Clinical Research Informatics domain with a specialization in biomedical NLP. The support of the K99/R00 grant will enable him to acquire substantial formal training in Computational Linguistics while contributing to the body of knowledge of the Clinical Research Informatics field. The five-year grant support will ensure success in his endeavor. The proposed work is highly significant because the dismal clinical trial accrual rates (2-4 % nationally) hampers timely development of new drugs. In addition, studies show that physicians have statistically significant bias against elderly and minority patients to invite participation in clinical trials. The proposed project is synergistic with physician-centered efforts but the goal is to provide individualized, EMR based clinical trial recommendations directly to the patients. The results of this research will empower the patients and elevate their role in the decision making process.

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research  Project Summary (Abstract):  Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.  Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.           Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research.

"Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this three-year project, we aim to apply state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine (EBM) and comparative effectiveness reviews. We plan to develop a human guided computerized abstract screening tool to greatly reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. This tool will combine proven machine learning techniques with a new open source tool that enables management of the screening process. This new technology will enable investigators to screen abstracts in a small fraction of the time compared to the current manual process. It will reduce the time and cost of producing systematic reviews, provide clear documentation of the process and potentially perform the task more accurately. With the acceptance of EBM and increasing demands for systematic reviews, there is a great need for tools to assist in generating new systematic reviews and in updating them. This need cannot be more pressing. The recent passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the $1.1 billion allocated for comparative effectiveness research have created an unprecedented need for systematic reviews and opportunities to improve the methodologies and efficiency of their conduct.   We herein propose the development of novel, open-source software to help systematic reviewers better   cope with these torrents of data. The research and development of this tool will be carried out by a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators with computer scientists at Tufts University who began to collaborate last year as a result of Tufts being awarded one of the NIH Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). We will pursue dissemination of the new technology through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program, Cochrane Collaboration, CTSA network, and other groups conducting systematic reviews, and production of tutorial material. Our aims are:   1. Conduct research to design and implement a semi-automated system using machine learning and   information retrieval methods to identify relevant abstracts in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of systematic reviews.   2. Develop Abstrackr, an open-source system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for screening abstracts, that applies the methods developed in Aim 1 to automatically exclude irrelevant abstracts/articles.   3. Evaluate the performance of the active learning model developed in Aim 1 and the functionality of   Abstrackr developed in Aim 2 through application to a collection of manually screened datasets of   biomedical abstracts that will subsequently be made publicly available for use as a repository to spur   research in the machine learning and information retrieval communities.           Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making. Systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to build a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care.",Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews,8115129,R01HS018494,[' '],AHRQ,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2011,136978,0.016977726954905074
"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats. The proposed project addresses this need by developing a system to extract relevant information from emergency department records.",Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance,8144459,G08LM009787,"['Abbreviations', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'American', 'Avian Influenza', 'Bioterrorism', 'Bird Flu vaccine', 'Breathing', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Coughing', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Hour', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'North Carolina', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pertussis', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smallpox', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Variant', 'acronyms', 'base', 'experience', 'improved', 'lexical', 'mortality', 'pandemic disease', 'population based', 'prototype', 'research to practice', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'syntax', 'tool']",NLM,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,G08,2011,147161,0.016224761262166522
"Machine-Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of new Bacterial Pathogens DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We appreciate the time and effort spent by all the reviewers, and we are grateful for the useful comments and provided suggestions. We have carefully reviewed the critiques and we are happy to see that the panel was receptive to our proposal. The reviewers expressed three major concerns in the summary statement: (1) although the investigating team is well qualified our history of collaboration is short; (2) details regarding the practical constraints of the BARDOT system are lacking; (3) the machine learning techniques employed in the project are considered fairly standard.  Below we briefly discuss the reviewers comments and indicate how we have changed our revised application to address the critique.  (1) Dr. Dundar moved from industry to academia in the fall of 2008, at which point Dr. Rajwa (one of the original inventors of BARDOT) and Dr. Dundar began their collaboration on new approaches to the problem of non-exhaustively defined classes in phenotypic screening. This scientific partnership immediately produced interesting results, and at the time of submission of the original application, Dr. Dundar and Dr. Rajwa had their first manuscript under review. The approach presented in the original proposal was tested and the results were submitted to the ACM 15th Annual SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'09), which is the largest and one of the most respected conferences in this field. The manuscript was accepted after a full peer review as one of the 50 regular papers selected from 551 submissions [20]. Following the proposal submission, research efforts continued and produced yet another approach to the problem described in this grant application. The preliminary findings are reported in a new manuscript which is currently under review [4].  (2) We rewrote the background and research methods sections of our proposal to include information re- quested by the reviewers regarding practical aspects of the BARDOT system, such as accuracy issues (Section D.3.2), frequency of encountering new, unknown classes (Section B.3.1), and validation (Section D.3.1).  (3) The problem of phenotypic screening and classification of bacteria can be defined within exhaustive (stan- dard) or non-exhaustive learning frameworks. Although we agree that the implementation of an exhaustive clas- sification approach for BARDOT does require only fairly standard tools, the problem of the non-exhaustive nature of training libraries cannot be addressed by straightforward use of any textbook-level technique. In fact, the presence of non-exhaustively defined set of classes violates basic assumptions for most supervised learning systems. The issue of non-exhaustively defined classes is the major obstacle for application of machine learning in phenotypic analysis since the number of possible phenotypes may be infinite. In our original proposal we argued that learning with a non-exhaustively defined set of classes remains a very challenging problem, and presented evidence demonstrating that simple extensions of standard techniques cannot provide an acceptable solution. Subsequently, we proposed a new approach based on Bayesian simulation of classes and showed that preliminary results outperformed benchmark techniques [4].  Although these initial results looked promising, we did not consider the described preliminary algorithms final and definitive, and we do not believe that at this point we are able to provide an exact algorithmic solution to this complex problem. If we were able to do that, it would mean that we had already accomplished all the grant goals. The very essence of the proposed research is finding the answer to the defined problem, and the answer will remain unknown until after the work has been done. However, positive reviews and an acceptance of our work by KDD'09 conference judges, tell us that we are heading in the right direction.  In the amended version of this application we propose a modified Bayesian approach based on Wishart priors (Section D.2.3). The algorithm creates new classes on the fly and evaluates maximum likelihood with the updated set of classes, gradually improving detection accuracy for future samples. We believe that this offers a substantial improvement over the previous method. Consequently, the preliminary results in Section C are updated to reflect our progress. Since the modified technique allows for classification with non-exhaustive and exhaustive sets using the same algorithm, we consolidated the previous specific aims 3 and 5 into one in the revised application.

"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators.

"Human-Centered Perceptual and Conceptual Classification of Biomedical Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity and importance yet effective computing solutions for managing images and understanding their content are lacking. Image understanding is a key limiting factor in advancing these endeavors. Major challenges remain in understanding the capabilities of the human visual system with respect to biomedical imaging and in extracting and utilizing tacit knowledge of domain experts. To meet these challenges, we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary approach which combines methods of user centered design, visual perception and computer imaging research to interact with domain experts and to elicit and use their extrinsic and intrinsic knowledge. We will use a novel contextual design approach to inspection of dermatology images to discover relationships between perceptually- relevant visual content of images and users' conceptual understanding as expressed through natural language. Analysis of users' eye movements and verbal descriptions, together with mapping to domain medical ontologies, will allow us to integrate visual data with a user-specified language model to define perceptual categories and inform image classification. This is a fundamental and challenging data to knowledge problem that has not been solved. This study will provide proof of concept of the value of eliciting tacit knowledge from domain experts through multiple perceptually relevant modes in order to integrate data and knowledge models for better image understanding and may help enact a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize and develop biomedical information systems, in general.             Project Narrative Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity yet their usefulness for research, medicine, and teaching is limited by the design of current computing systems. Discoveries and concrete advances made in this study will contribute to solutions for effective use of digital images-a problem that is central to research and application across science, technology, and medicine. Advancements in our understanding of the design of useful and usable information systems will benefit society at large and contribute to the public health.

"Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed work is to understand how learning by the visual system helps it to represent the immediate environment during perception. Because perception is accurate, we can know spatial layout: the shapes, orientations, sizes, and spatial locations of the objects and surfaces around us. But this accuracy requires that the visual system learn over time how best to interpret visual ""cues"". These cues are the signals from the environment that the visual system extracts from the retinal images that are informative about spatial layout. Known cues include binocular disparity, texture gradients, occlusion relations, motion parallax, and familiar size, to name a few. How do these cues come to be interpreted correctly? A fundamental problem is that visual cues are ambiguous. Even if cues could be measured exactly (which they cannot, the visual system being a physical device) there would still be different possible 3D interpretations for a given set of cues. As a result, the visual system is forced to operate probabilistically: the way things ""look"" to us reflects an implicit guess as to which interpretation of the cues is most likely to be correct. Each additional cue helps improve the guess. For example, the retinal image of a door could be interpreted as a vertical rectangle or as some other quadrilateral at a non-vertical orientation in space, and the shadow cues at the bottom of the door helps the system know that it's a vertical rectangle. What mechanisms do the visual system use to discern which cues are available for interpreting images correctly? The proposed work aims to answer this fundamental question about perceptual learning. It was recently shown that the visual system can detect and start using new cues for perception. This phenomenon can be studied in the laboratory using classical conditioning procedures that were previously developed to study learning in animals. In the proposed experiments, a model system is used to understand details about when this learning occurs and what is learned. The data will be compared to predictions based on older, analogous studies in the animal learning literature, and interpreted in the context of Bayesian statistical inference, especially machine learning theory. The proposed work benefits public health by characterizing the brain mechanisms that keep visual perception accurate. These mechanisms are at work in the many months during which a person with congenital cataracts learns to use vision after the cataracts are removed, and it is presumably these mechanisms that go awry when an individual with a family history of synesthesia or autism develops anomalous experience-dependent perceptual responses. Neurodegenerative diseases may disrupt visual learning, in which case visual learning tests could be used to detect disease; understanding the learning of new cues in human vision could lead to better computerized aids for the visually impaired; and knowing what causes a new cue to be learned could lead to new technologies for training people to perceive accurately in novel work environments.          n/a",Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception,8139754,R01EY013988,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Appearance', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cataract', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family history of', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rotation', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Vision Disparity', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'area MT', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'congenital cataract', 'design', 'devices for the visually impaired', 'experience', 'improved', 'meetings', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'stereoscopic', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual information', 'visual learning', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2011,219694,-0.04326306987972447

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data.

"A Hybrid General Natural Language Processing Architecture    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic medical records and exchanges offer new opportunities for the analysis of population health data; however, new methods in natural language processing (NLP) must first be developed to structure and codify these records, since most medical data is in the form of free text which cannot be stored and manipulated by computers. Once this is accomplished, population health data can be analyzed which will lead to better treatment guidelines, targeted drug therapy, and more cost effective care. Logical Semantics, Inc. (LSI) proposes to develop new statistical NLP methods for analyzing large scale medical domains. These methods will leverage LSI's semantic annotation technology, which has created the largest semantically annotated clinical corpus in the world. LSI's goal is to semantically index large medical record repositories accurately against propositions arranged in knowledge ontologies and make these indices available for text mining applications. The phase one research is focused on three specific aims that will lead to breakthroughs in the science of NLP: (1) Develop new statistical NLP algorithms employing a large semantically annotated medical corpus, (2) Semi-automate knowledge ontology generation, and (3) Develop and combine rule based with statistical NLP algorithms to create a superior hybrid NLP system. The achievement of these aims will result in computer systems that can extract the meaning from free text medical records so researchers, policy makers, and clinicians can use health analytics to improve healthcare.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Natural language processing (NLP) has been successful in extracting specific findings and diagnoses from free text medical records.

"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats.

"Human-Centered Perceptual and Conceptual Classification of Biomedical Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity and importance yet effective computing solutions for managing images and understanding their content are lacking. Image understanding is a key limiting factor in advancing these endeavors. Major challenges remain in understanding the capabilities of the human visual system with respect to biomedical imaging and in extracting and utilizing tacit knowledge of domain experts. To meet these challenges, we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary approach which combines methods of user centered design, visual perception and computer imaging research to interact with domain experts and to elicit and use their extrinsic and intrinsic knowledge. We will use a novel contextual design approach to inspection of dermatology images to discover relationships between perceptually- relevant visual content of images and users' conceptual understanding as expressed through natural language. Analysis of users' eye movements and verbal descriptions, together with mapping to domain medical ontologies, will allow us to integrate visual data with a user-specified language model to define perceptual categories and inform image classification. This is a fundamental and challenging data to knowledge problem that has not been solved. This study will provide proof of concept of the value of eliciting tacit knowledge from domain experts through multiple perceptually relevant modes in order to integrate data and knowledge models for better image understanding and may help enact a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize and develop biomedical information systems, in general.             Project Narrative Biomedical images are ever increasing in quantity yet their usefulness for research, medicine, and teaching is limited by the design of current computing systems. Discoveries and concrete advances made in this study will contribute to solutions for effective use of digital images-a problem that is central to research and application across science, technology, and medicine.

"Dx Ear: An automated tool for diagnosis of otitis media    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Otitis media is a general term for middle-ear inflammation that is classified clinically as either acute otitis media (AOM) or otitis media with effusion (OME). AOM represents a bacterial super infection of the middle ear fluid and OME a sterile effusion that tends to subside spontaneously. Antibiotics are generally beneficial only for AOM. Accurate diagnosis of AOM, as well as distinction from both OME and no effusion (NOE) requires considerable training.  AOM is the most common infection for which antimicrobial agents are prescribed for children in the US. By age seven, 93 percent of children will have experienced one or more episodes of otitis media.1 AOM results in significant social burden and indirect costs due to time lost from school and work. Estimated direct costs of AOM in 1995 were $1.96 billion and indirect costs were estimated to be $1.02 billion, with a total of 20 million prescriptions for antimicrobials related to otitis media.2 Given these considerations, our goal is to:  Develop a software tool to classify images into one of three stringent clinical diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE), and validate the algorithm on tympanic membrane (TM) images.  We have assembled a strong multidisciplinary team that can successfully develop an automated diagnostic algorithm in this Phase-I program. We have (1) gathered a team of nationally-recognized otoscopists with substantial clinical and research experience in the context of AOM clinical trials; (2) studied the predictive value of diagnostic findings in discriminating AOM from OME from NOE; (3) acquired a large number of TM images from children; and (4) involved an internationally recognized expert in developing algorithms in all areas of image analysis and processing.  In the planned Phase-II, we will use the algorithm developed in the Phase-I program and incorporate it into a user-friendly and marketable digital otoscope-software platform that can be used at the point-of-care by clinicians to improve the care of children with this frequently occurring condition. This will be followed by a clinical trial evaluating its immediate impact on clinical care, and, in particular, utilization of antimicrobials.  Our main goal will be to develop an accurate automated algorithm for classifying the three diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE). We aim to achieve an overall accuracy of 95 percent by applying a newly developed classification algorithm. This will include applying state-of-the-art classification methods as well as segmentation algorithms, for automated, robust diagnosis and classification of the three diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE). We propose to achieve this through the following two specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop a robust and accurate diagnostic algorithm that can discriminate TM digital images into 1of 3 stringent diagnostic categories (AOM/OME/NOE).  Specific Aim 2: Validate the algorithm on a dataset that includes over 2000 TM images collected in a recently completed NIAID-sponsored clinical trial.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    AOM is the most common infection for which antimicrobial agents are prescribed in children in the US.

"Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The goals of our project are as follows:     1. Create a corpus of temporally annotated data. Under the supervision of our consultants Dr. Frank Sacks, Dr. Vincent Carey, and two Registered Nurses, we will create a gold-standard annotation of events and temporal information within patient narratives from de- identified Electronic Health Record data using the CLEF and TimeML guidelines. We will use the framework of the Brandeis Annotation Tool, a system we have designed to facilitate the quick construction of accurately annotated corpora against a specified guideline. Extensions to the current event library and lexicon with medical event references will be made during the annotation process, under the guidance of the Registered Nurses.          2. Adapt the TARSQI Toolkit (TTK) to targeted temporal properties and relations in the EHR domain. We will use the TARSQI toolkit, a robust set of temporal processing algorithms we have designed for parsing natural language text, to automatically annotate the events and temporal information in EHR data. Combined with the Brandeis AcroMed Medical Abbreviation Server and those terms introduced in part 1, we will employ the Specialist Lexicon and other medical resources to extend the toolkit capabilities for recognizing and interpreting medical event information. Algorithms for identifying events, temporal expressions, and event anchorings and orderings will be trained against the gold standard created in Aim 1, and tested against held-out data.     3. Create a cross-document temporal database of medical events. Using the recognition algorithms introduced in Aim 2, we will create a searchable, temporally ordered database of medical events such as diseases, symptoms, surgeries/interventions, and test results. Events referred to multiple times in the data will be merged using a constraint- satisfaction analysis in order to create a more coherent narrative for a single patient over multiple records.           Project Narrative It is becoming increasingly common for medical researchers to use Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as a primary source of data for researching correlations between various medical issues and concepts. However, EHRs typically contain unstructured text, making them difficult to mine.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,8056227,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2010,177422,0.018158857668336074
"Automated creation of clinical progress notes with machine learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical encounters require the creation of an enormous amount of documentation. This documentation is tedious, time-consuming, and, in practice, is usually created hours after the encounter has occurred. The requirement to create this documentation places a tremendous burden on the time of clinical staff, and due to pressing workloads, can lead to incorrect recall and clinical data errors. The project intends to prove that progress note portion of this documentation process can be automated by novel application of recent advances in machine learning. A software system will be built with Support Vector Machine theory at its core. The software system can learn from existing clinical progress notes, and then apply those learned method by auto-generating the subjective/analytical portions of the note. The project will also examine learnings from individual physician notes compared to collections of multiple physician notes in order to built a superior model. The project's impact on the quality, and cost, of care should be dramatic. Reductions in documentation error rates and increases in physician productivity equate to an incredible array of quantitative benefits.

"USE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO IDENTIFY LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF COPING    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of action is key to improving psychosocial interventions for cancer and other chronic disease conditions. In cancer, emotional expression has been identified as one possible mediator of the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient-reported outcomes. However, scientific evaluations of psychological mechanisms of adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases are constrained by limitations associated with self-report measures. Because self-care resources, peer-to-peer networks, and more recent forms of psychosocial intervention are increasingly being delivered online, linguistic and behavioral data can be used to characterize internal coping processes, social interactions, and other manifest behaviors. Few tools are currently available for harnessing text as a potential data source, and signal detection indices of existing tools leave room for considerable improvement in these methodologies (Bantum & Owen, 2009). In the present study, natural language processing and other tools of computational linguistics will be used to develop a machine-learning classifier to identify emotional expression in electronic text data. The aims of the study are: 1) to annotate a large text corpus from cancer survivors using an objective and reliable emotion-coding procedure, 2) to incorporate linguistic and psychological features into a machine-learning classification method and identify which of these features are most strongly associated with codes assigned by trained human raters, and 3) to develop combined psychological and natural language processing (NLP) methods for identifying linguistic markers of emotional coping behaviors. To accomplish these aims, a comprehensive corpus of emotionally-laden cancer communications will be developed from 5 existing linguistic datasets. Five raters will be selected and undergo a rigorous training procedure for coding emotional expression using an emotion-coding system previously developed by the research. Coding will take place using an Internet-based coding interface that will allow the investigators to continuously monitor inter-rater reliability. Simultaneous with the coding process, the investigators will link the electronic text data with key linguistic and psychological features, including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW), WordNet, part of speech tags, patterns of capitalization and punctuation, emoticons, and textual context. A machine-learning classifier, using tools of natural language processing, will then be applied to the text/feature data and validated against human-rated emotion codes. The long-term objective of this research is to advance a methodology for objectively identifying coping behavior, particularly emotional expression, in order to supplement self-report measures and improve scientific understanding of adjustment to chronic disease, trauma, or other psychological conditions. This work is essential for identifying mechanisms of action in psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors and others and has significance for the fields of medicine, psychology, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being. To date, the study of these factors as mechanisms of action has been limited to self-report measures that may not correlate well with other more objective indicators. The proposed study will improve our ability to identify mechanisms of action by supplementing self-report measures with objectively identified markers of coping behaviors such as emotional expression in natural language used by individuals living with cancer.           Identifying specific emotional, cognitive, and behavioral factors that contribute to adjustment to cancer and other chronic diseases is essential for being able to develop and improve effective interventions to promote health and well-being.

"Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed work is to understand how learning by the visual system helps it to represent the immediate environment during perception. Because perception is accurate, we can know spatial layout: the shapes, orientations, sizes, and spatial locations of the objects and surfaces around us. But this accuracy requires that the visual system learn over time how best to interpret visual ""cues"". These cues are the signals from the environment that the visual system extracts from the retinal images that are informative about spatial layout. Known cues include binocular disparity, texture gradients, occlusion relations, motion parallax, and familiar size, to name a few. How do these cues come to be interpreted correctly? A fundamental problem is that visual cues are ambiguous. Even if cues could be measured exactly (which they cannot, the visual system being a physical device) there would still be different possible 3D interpretations for a given set of cues. As a result, the visual system is forced to operate probabilistically: the way things ""look"" to us reflects an implicit guess as to which interpretation of the cues is most likely to be correct. Each additional cue helps improve the guess. For example, the retinal image of a door could be interpreted as a vertical rectangle or as some other quadrilateral at a non-vertical orientation in space, and the shadow cues at the bottom of the door helps the system know that it's a vertical rectangle. What mechanisms do the visual system use to discern which cues are available for interpreting images correctly? The proposed work aims to answer this fundamental question about perceptual learning. It was recently shown that the visual system can detect and start using new cues for perception. This phenomenon can be studied in the laboratory using classical conditioning procedures that were previously developed to study learning in animals. In the proposed experiments, a model system is used to understand details about when this learning occurs and what is learned. The data will be compared to predictions based on older, analogous studies in the animal learning literature, and interpreted in the context of Bayesian statistical inference, especially machine learning theory. The proposed work benefits public health by characterizing the brain mechanisms that keep visual perception accurate. These mechanisms are at work in the many months during which a person with congenital cataracts learns to use vision after the cataracts are removed, and it is presumably these mechanisms that go awry when an individual with a family history of synesthesia or autism develops anomalous experience-dependent perceptual responses. Neurodegenerative diseases may disrupt visual learning, in which case visual learning tests could be used to detect disease; understanding the learning of new cues in human vision could lead to better computerized aids for the visually impaired; and knowing what causes a new cue to be learned could lead to new technologies for training people to perceive accurately in novel work environments.          n/a",Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception,7911700,R01EY013988,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Appearance', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cataract', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family history of', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rotation', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Vision Disparity', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'area MT', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'congenital cataract', 'design', 'devices for the visually impaired', 'experience', 'improved', 'meetings', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'stereoscopic', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual information', 'visual learning', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2010,226559,-0.04326306987972447
"Machine-Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of new Bacterial Pathogens    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We appreciate the time and effort spent by all the reviewers, and we are grateful for the useful comments and provided suggestions. We have carefully reviewed the critiques and we are happy to see that the panel was receptive to our proposal. The reviewers expressed three major concerns in the summary statement: (1) although the investigating team is well qualified our history of collaboration is short; (2) details regarding the practical constraints of the BARDOT system are lacking; (3) the machine learning techniques employed in the project are considered fairly standard.  Below we briefly discuss the reviewers comments and indicate how we have changed our revised application to address the critique.  (1) Dr. Dundar moved from industry to academia in the fall of 2008, at which point Dr. Rajwa (one of the original inventors of BARDOT) and Dr. Dundar began their collaboration on new approaches to the problem of non-exhaustively defined classes in phenotypic screening. This scientific partnership immediately produced interesting results, and at the time of submission of the original application, Dr. Dundar and Dr. Rajwa had their first manuscript under review. The approach presented in the original proposal was tested and the results were submitted to the ACM 15th Annual SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'09), which is the largest and one of the most respected conferences in this field. The manuscript was accepted after a full peer review as one of the 50 regular papers selected from 551 submissions [20]. Following the proposal submission, research efforts continued and produced yet another approach to the problem described in this grant application. The preliminary findings are reported in a new manuscript which is currently under review [4].  (2) We rewrote the background and research methods sections of our proposal to include information re- quested by the reviewers regarding practical aspects of the BARDOT system, such as accuracy issues (Section D.3.2), frequency of encountering new, unknown classes (Section B.3.1), and validation (Section D.3.1).  (3) The problem of phenotypic screening and classification of bacteria can be defined within exhaustive (stan- dard) or non-exhaustive learning frameworks. Although we agree that the implementation of an exhaustive clas- sification approach for BARDOT does require only fairly standard tools, the problem of the non-exhaustive nature of training libraries cannot be addressed by straightforward use of any textbook-level technique. In fact, the presence of non-exhaustively defined set of classes violates basic assumptions for most supervised learning systems. The issue of non-exhaustively defined classes is the major obstacle for application of machine learning in phenotypic analysis since the number of possible phenotypes may be infinite. In our original proposal we argued that learning with a non-exhaustively defined set of classes remains a very challenging problem, and presented evidence demonstrating that simple extensions of standard techniques cannot provide an acceptable solution. Subsequently, we proposed a new approach based on Bayesian simulation of classes and showed that preliminary results outperformed benchmark techniques [4].  Although these initial results looked promising, we did not consider the described preliminary algorithms final and definitive, and we do not believe that at this point we are able to provide an exact algorithmic solution to this complex problem. If we were able to do that, it would mean that we had already accomplished all the grant goals. The very essence of the proposed research is finding the answer to the defined problem, and the answer will remain unknown until after the work has been done. However, positive reviews and an acceptance of our work by KDD'09 conference judges, tell us that we are heading in the right direction.  In the amended version of this application we propose a modified Bayesian approach based on Wishart priors (Section D.2.3). The algorithm creates new classes on the fly and evaluates maximum likelihood with the updated set of classes, gradually improving detection accuracy for future samples. We believe that this offers a substantial improvement over the previous method. Consequently, the preliminary results in Section C are updated to reflect our progress. Since the modified technique allows for classification with non-exhaustive and exhaustive sets using the same algorithm, we consolidated the previous specific aims 3 and 5 into one in the revised application.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Machine Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of Bacterial Pathogens  using Laser Light Scattering  PIs: Dr. M.

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening.

"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The common goals to many, if not all, biomedical research programs are the development of tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

"Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eTfor2 project will develop and evaluate open-source programs and knowledge representations to better characterize patients for translational and clinical research studies. The project addresses National Library of Medicine (NLM) RFA initiatives for: (a) information & knowledge processing, including natural language processing and text summarization, (b) approaches for linking phenomic and genomic information, and (c) integration of information from heterogeneous sources. Translational studies correlate clinical patient descriptors (phenome) with results of genomic investigations, e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Standard methods for defining phenotypes require costly, labor-intensive cohort enrollments to identify patients with diseases and appropriate controls. Recently, translational and clinical researchers have used electronic medical record (EMR) data as an alternative to identifying patient characteristics. However, EMR case extraction requires substantial manual review and ""tuning"" for case selection, due to the inaccuracies inherent in ICD9 billing codes. While relevant and useful natural language processing (NLP) approaches to facilitate EMR text extraction have proliferated, the target patient descriptors these approaches employ typically remain non-standard and locally defined, and vary from disease to disease, project to project and institution to institution. At best, such NLP applications use standard terminology descriptors such as SNOMED-CT as EMR extraction targets. Yet, there is no generally utilized ""standard"" knowledge base that links such ""extractable"" descriptors to an academic-quality knowledge source detailing what findings have been reliably reported to occur in each disease. To facilitate translational and clinical research, the eTfor2 project will make available an open-source, evidence-based, electronic clinical knowledge base (KB) and related NLP tools enabling researchers at any site to extract a standard ""target"" set of EMR-based phenomic descriptors at both the finding and disease levels. It will further include diagnostic decision support logic to confirm the degree of support for patients' diagnoses in their EMR records. The eTfor2 project will decrease effort required to harvest EMR patient descriptors for clinical and translational studies, and enable new translational work that identifies genomic associations at both finding and disease levels. The eTfor2 resources should improve the quality and cross-institutional validity of EMR-based translational and clinical studies.           Evidence-based Diagnostic Tools for Translational and Clinical Research (eTfor2) Project Narrative When completed successfully, the eTfor2 project will enable researchers at disparate institutions to extract from their respective EMR systems a shared ""target"" set of common phenomic descriptors, in a standard, reproducible manner.

"Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this three-year project, we aim to apply state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine (EBM) and comparative effectiveness reviews. We plan to develop a human guided computerized abstract screening tool to greatly reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. This tool will combine proven machine learning techniques with a new open source tool that enables management of the screening process. This new technology will enable investigators to screen abstracts in a small fraction of the time compared to the current manual process. It will reduce the time and cost of producing systematic reviews, provide clear documentation of the process and potentially perform the task more accurately. With the acceptance of EBM and increasing demands for systematic reviews, there is a great need for tools to assist in generating new systematic reviews and in updating them. This need cannot be more pressing. The recent passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the $1.1 billion allocated for comparative effectiveness research have created an unprecedented need for systematic reviews and opportunities to improve the methodologies and efficiency of their conduct.   We herein propose the development of novel, open-source software to help systematic reviewers better   cope with these torrents of data. The research and development of this tool will be carried out by a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators with computer scientists at Tufts University who began to collaborate last year as a result of Tufts being awarded one of the NIH Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). We will pursue dissemination of the new technology through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program, Cochrane Collaboration, CTSA network, and other groups conducting systematic reviews, and production of tutorial material. Our aims are:   1. Conduct research to design and implement a semi-automated system using machine learning and   information retrieval methods to identify relevant abstracts in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of systematic reviews.   2. Develop Abstrackr, an open-source system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for screening abstracts, that applies the methods developed in Aim 1 to automatically exclude irrelevant abstracts/articles.   3. Evaluate the performance of the active learning model developed in Aim 1 and the functionality of   Abstrackr developed in Aim 2 through application to a collection of manually screened datasets of   biomedical abstracts that will subsequently be made publicly available for use as a repository to spur   research in the machine learning and information retrieval communities.           Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making. Systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to build a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care.",Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews,7933715,R01HS018494,[' '],AHRQ,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2010,388462,0.016977726954905074
"Accessible Handling of Misclassified or Missing Binary Variables in CER Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common but often overlooked threats to the validity of comparative effectiveness research (CER) studies include the misclassification or missingness of binary variables that are crucial to the ultimate analysis of the data. These variables potentially include the outcome of interest in standard or repeated measures logistic regression models, the factor (exposure) of interest, or an important confounder of the association under study. This proposal seeks to facilitate the investigation of the resulting biases to which a given CER analysis may be subject, and to provide study design-based remedial measures via which validity can be restored. The focus is upon statistical methods for conducting sensitivity analyses, as well as methods designed to make efficient use of supplemental data sources. The latter include validation data (in the case of misclassification), and so-called reassessment data (in the case of potentially informative missingness). A primary consideration throughout includes the incorporation of subject-specific covariates into the model of interest, as well as into models for the underlying misclassification or missingness process. Another primary goal is to establish a relatively consistent likelihood-based framework for all proposed analyses incorporating supplemental data, and to provide user-friendly programs utilizing common statistical software in order to make the methods broadly and readily accessible to those conducting CER. While not limited to specific applications, the proposed research draws motivation from and lends itself to illustration via two real-world studies. The first is the HIV Epidemiology Research Study (HERS), an observational cohort study in which the binary diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was made at repeated visits via both error-prone and sophisticated assay techniques. The second is an emergency department-based ophthalmologic study in which non-dilated ocular fundus photography will be used for diagnosing serious ocular conditions, and will be compared against existing standard diagnostic methods. Both studies involve internal validation data to facilitate corrections for misclassification based on a fallible diagnostic method, and both are also subject to missing outcome and/or predictor data.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to provide statistical methods to aid comparative effectiveness research (CER) investigators with common problems encountered in data analysis. The problems upon which the project focuses come about when binary (""yes/no"") data are subject to being incorrectly measured (misclassified), or when they are sometimes not observed (missing) for reasons that might relate to information about subjects in the study. The intention is to provide CER investigators with methods that are relatively easy to use, yet effective and powerful for combating these challenges to valid data analysis.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to provide statistical methods to aid comparative effectiveness research (CER) investigators with common problems encountered in data analysis.

"Multi-source clinical Question Answering system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   / Abstract (Limit: 1 page) Our proposal addresses the following challenge area: 06-LM-101* Intelligent Search Tool for Answering Clinical Questions. Develop new computational approaches to information retrieval that would allow a clinician or clinical researcher to pose a single query that would result in search of multiple data sources to produce a coherent response that highlights key relevant information which may signal new insights for clinical research or patient care. Information that could help a clinician diagnose or manage a health condition, or help a clinical researcher explore the significance of issues that arise during a clinical trial, is scattered across many different types of resources, such as paper or electronic charts, trial protocols, published biomedical articles, or best-practice guidelines for care. Develop artificial intelligence and information retrieval approaches that allow a clinician or researcher confronting complex patient problems to pose a single query that will result in a search that appears to ""understand"" the question, a search that inspects multiple databases and brings findings together into a useful answer. Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab. The questions usually asked either require information highly specific to their patient, e.g. the patient's lab results or previous history, answered by the patient's health record, or a more general type of information usually answered through generally available information sources. QA systems enhance the results of search engines by providing a concise summary of relevant information along with source hits. PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) is the most ubiquitous biomedical search engine, however because it is a search engine the information retrieved is based on keyword searches and is not presented in a form for immediate consumption; the user has to drill down into the content of the webpages to find the facts/statements of interest. Moreover, the information that the clinician needs is likely to be of different types, for example a definition of a syndrome in combination with specific actions triggered by a particular diagnosis for a particular patient. Such information resides in different sources - encyclopedic and the EMR - and has to be dynamically accessed and presented to the user in an easily digestible format. We propose to develop a unified platform for clinical QA from multiple sources of clinical and biomedical narrative that implements semantic processing of the questions by fusing two existing technologies - the Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. The specific research questions we are aiming to answer are: ""How much effort is required to port a general semantic QA system to the clinical domain? How much additional domain-specific training is required? ""What is the accuracy of such a system? Question Answering in the clinical domain is an emerging area of research. The challenges in the field are mainly attributed to the number of components that require domain specific training along with strict system requirements in terms of high precision and recall complemented by an accessible and user-friendly presentation. Our approach to overcome them is to re-use components already in place as part of Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. Our approach is innovative in bringing together information from encyclopedic sources and the EMR to present it into a unified form to the clinician at the point of care or the investigator in the lab. The technology for that is based on semantic language processing which aims at ""understanding"" the meaning of the question and the narrative. Our proposed system holds the potential to impact quality of healthcare and translational research. Our approach is feasible because it uses content already in the EMR at the Mayo Clinic along with general medical knowledge from multiple readily-available resources. The proposed system will be built off mature and tested components allowing a fast and robust delivery cycle. Our unique integration of technologies together with sophisticated statistical machine learning algorithms applied to rich linguistic knowledge about events, contradictions, semantic structure, and question-types, will allow us to build a system which significantly extends the range of possible question types and responses available to clinicians, and seamlessly fuses these to generate a response. Our proposed work represents a high impact area that has the potential to improve healthcare delivery because it addresses needs that have been well-documented and studied (Ely et al., 2005). We aim to provide a unified multi-source solution for semantic retrieval, access and summarization of relevant information at the point of care or the lab. As such, the proposed cQA has the potential to play a vital and important decision- support role for the physician or the biomedical investigator. (max 2-3 sentences) Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab.

"DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY    Description (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Healthcare Data, 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions.    The lack of prescribing information and meaningful dosing guidance places an incredible burden on our pediatric caregivers with the end-result often the sub-optimal use of many medicines in children [1]. It is widely believed by the Institute of Medicine and American Association of Pediatrics that prescribing errors can be reduced via intelligent decision support systems that facilitate pharmacotherapy decision making [2]. We are developing drug-specific Pediatric Pharmacotherapy Decision Support Systems (PPDSS) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in an attempt to address these issues. Our goals for this system include the ability to: 1) provide dosing guidance consistent with formulary standard of care, 2) examine patient-specific pharmacotherapeutic indices with target agents relative to historical controls derived from the hospital data warehouse, 3) explore diagnoses - drug correlation in conjunction with utilization and 4) educate physicians on clinical pharmacologic principles specific to population and drug combinations of interest. Within this system, static compendial information (e.g., Lexi-Comp) can be searched, indexed and summarized for easy viewing; real-time, forecasting of relevant drug exposure or clinical markers (lab values, pharmacodynamics, adverse events) is made available based on interface to current patient data from our electronic medical records (EMR) system. Our long-term vision is to facilitate the safe and effective administration of drugs used in the treatment of children with an evolving collection of PPDSS providing improved management of patient pharmacotherapy.       The objective of this challenge grant application is to create a patient-based informatics system that contains the relevant guidance concerning dosing of specific agents to various pediatric subpopulations. This guidance will have the opportunity to grow (artificial intelligence) as patient diversity expands the historical experience (population priors) with an agent or combination of agents. This research application provides compelling evidence that clinical pharmacology driven decision support systems can interface with hospital EMR to provide individualized pharmacotherapy guidance. Our central hypothesis is that dosing guidance can be improved when the caregiver responsible for pharmacotherapy is informed in an expedient manner while in the process of patient care. The integration of well-characterized models that account for sources of variation in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and/or relationships with clinical outcomes is married with the most relevant clinical data associated with the management of a particular or combination of drug and disease states. The incoming clinical data streams can of course expand as new information becomes available (e.g., genomic data and guidance). Drug dashboards are designed for and by the physician therapeutic area in collaboration with Clinical Pharmacology and IT team members. Current prototype dashboards provide forecasting of drug exposure at select time points consistent with clinical protocols used to manage toxicity and efficacy. Forecasting tools permit dosing scenarios to be explored via a user-friendly interface that front-ends a pediatric population-based PK/PD model. By mobilizing the pediatric caregiver, clinical pharmacology and health IT sectors we envision a heightened appreciation for pharmacology-based decision support solutions and an evolving strategy to use such solutions to improve outcomes in children. The project brings together drug-specific decision support generated by our clinical pharmacology experts and clinical caregivers with predictive models generated by our pharmacometrics and informatics team. Drug dashboard prototypes for methotrexate (chemotherapeutic agent) and tacrolimus (used to prevent organ rejection) are under development and will be clinically evaluated prior to a production launch. The prediction engines and forecasting routines are transparent to the end-user; emphasis on clinical outcomes including reduced medication errors and length of hospital stay will be used to demonstrate the ROI for individual dashboards. Funding this application will ensure the generalizability of our data integration solution beyond CHOP boundaries, provide the appropriate test data to qualify/validate the prediction algorithms and generate the clinical experience with the PPDSS that will encourage other therapeutic areas and institutions to utilize the system.

An important feature of the research is the incorporation of predictive models that provide real-time forecasting of patient response to existing therapy recommendations conditioned on prior patient experience with the potential to provide clinical scenario testing if the caregiver requests [3].

"Natural Language Processing for Cancer Research Network Surveillance Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses Broad Challenge Area: (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic: 10-CA-107 Expand Spectrum of Cancer Surveillance through Informatics Approaches. The proposed project launches a collaborative effort to advance adoption within the HMO Cancer Research Network (CRN) of ""industrial-strength"" natural language processing (NLP) systems useful for mining valuable, research-grade information from unstructured clinical text. Such text is available for processing, now in the electronic medical record (EMR) systems of affiliated CRN health plans. The proposed NLP methods   will create ongoing capacity to tap what has recently been described as ""a treasure trove of historical   unstructured data that provides essential information for the study of disease progression, treatment   effectiveness and long-term outcomes"" (5). The vision of advancing widespread NLP capacity across the CRN, as well as the approach we present here for implementing it, grew out of an in-depth strategic planning effort we completed in December 2008. That effort involved participants from six CRN sites guided by a blue-ribbon panel of NLP experts from three of the nation's leading centers of clinical NLP research: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Vanderbilt University, and Mayo Clinic. The vision is to deploy a powerful NLP system locally, manage it with newly hired and trained local NLP technical staff, and conduct NLP-based research projects initiated by local investigators, in consultation with higher-level external NLP experts. Our planning efforts suggest this collaborative model is feasible; we will test the model in the context of the proposed project. An important development in April 2009 yielded what we believe is a potentially transformative opportunity to accelerate adoption of NLP capacity in applied research settings: release of the open-source Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) software. This software was the result of a collaborative effort between IBM and Mayo Clinic. Built on the same framework Mayo Clinic currently uses to process its repository of over 40 million clinical documents, cTAKES dramatically lowers the cost of adopting a comprehensive and flexible NLP system. Deployment and use of such systems was previously only feasible in institutions with large, academically-oriented biomedical informatics research programs.   Still, other deployment challenges and the need to acquire NLP training for local staff present residual   barriers to adopting comprehensive NLP systems such as cTAKES. In collaboration with five other CRN sites the proposed project mitigates these challenges in two ways: 1) it develops configurable open-source software modules needed to streamline and therefore reduce the cost of deploying cTAKES, and 2) it presents and tests a model for training local staff through hands-on NLP projects overseen by outside NLP expert consultants. The potential impact of this project is evident most clearly in the vast untapped opportunities for text mining represented in CRN-affiliated health plans, where EMR systems have been in place since at least 2005, and whose patients represent 4% of the U.S. population. Clinical text mining offers the potential to provide new or improved data elements for cancer surveillance and other types of research requiring information about patient functional status, medication side-effects, details of therapeutic approaches, and differential information about clinical findings. Another significant impact of this project is its plan to integrate into the cTAKES system   an open-source de-identification tool based on state of the art, best of breed NLP approaches developed by the MITRE Corporation. De-identification of clinical text will make it easier for researchers to get access to clinical text, and will also facilitate multi-site collaborations while protecting patient privacy. Finally, if successful, the NLP algorithm we propose as a proof-of-principle project at Group Health-which will classify sets of patient charts as either containing or not containing a diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer-could dramatically reduce the cost of research in this area; currently all recurrent breast cancer endpoints must be established through costly manual chart abstraction.   Novel aspects of the proposed project include its talented and transdisciplinary research team,   including national experts in NLP, and its resourceful strategy for building the technical resources and ""human capital"" needed to support an ongoing program of applied NLP research. Natural language processing is itself a highly innovative technology; when successfully established in multiple CRN in the future it will represent a watershed moment in the CRN's already impressive history of exploiting data systems to support innovative research. Newly hired staff positions total approximately 2.0 FTE in each project year, most of which we anticipate will be supported by ongoing new research programs after the proposed project concludes. Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches. Because these methods are generic they will potentially contribute to public health by advancing research in a wide variety of areas. The ""proof of principle"" algorithm developed in the project to identify recurrent breast cancer diagnoses will advance epidemiologic and clinical research pertaining to the 2.5 million women currently living with breast cancer.           Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches.

"Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10): Increasing Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions. Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced computational techniques, applied to complex, multidimensional, streaming, clinical data (historic, physiologic, laboratory, imaging, etc) from disparate health care digital data sources, can be used to produce integrated, higher level representations of critically ill patients for knowledge discovery and decision support for the 'next' patient. Vast amounts of digital health care data are available for real time computational analysis using artificial intelligence and statistical approaches such as data clustering and neural networks to ascertain relationships, determine 'diagnostic clusters' and trend outcomes of therapy in individual and groups of patients. While such algorithms have successful applications in business, industry, physical sciences and in parts of health care, several barriers exist for their broader application to intensive care medicine and other health care domains. Using AI and automated computational methodology we will develop algorithms for data mining raw medical data from disparate clinical data sources. This will enable understanding and  application of the most recent experiential information from large numbers of critically ill patients to find similarities between a current individual patient and historical, similar populations with known treatment outcomes. This will iteratively lead to a refined representation of the individual patient and guide patient management. This project is not merely the development of a database, although this is an essential precursor for the application of the advanced analytic techniques we will develop. It is ultimately about developing a framework to support the extraction, manipulation and construction of new views, relationships and information of and from observational clinical data from multiple sources to enable meaningful analysis and application at the patient's bedside. There are many open questions not sufficiently addressed about the translation of raw clinical data into an analytic computational infrastructure capable of providing bedside decision support. We will integrate expertise in medicine, computational mathematics and computer science to construct suitable data structures and develop AI computational techniques for analysis and presentation. Our goal is to advance the development of explicit methodology to bring analyzed comparative data to the bedside of critically ill children in real time to support clinical decision-making. Such a process will involve: 1.) transformation of patient-centric data across disparate platforms into a large relational database; 2.) construction of an integrated data model, assuring data integrity, structure and security; and finally, 3.) data analysis and presentation as meaningful comparative metrics that adequately characterize the time-based continuum of critical illness. Analytics can then be developed and algorithms refined that can be applied to severity of illness, prognostic, therapeutic, and anomaly detection in patients, hospital units, and national populations, thus painting a holistic picture of patients and populations. Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients. We will use advanced computational techniques and artificial intelligence to detect categories within raw medical data from disparate data sources allowing the most recent experiential information about large numbers of critically ill children to be mined to find similarities between the index case and historical cases with known outcomes. This will enable decision support for diagnosis, management, therapy and outcomes serving the functions of disease detection, direct patient care, quality, and safety.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients.

"Robust Classification Methods for Categorical Regression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving statistical methods to provide better classification performance and new analytical capabilities for categorical regression would be invaluable to the medical and health care research communities. Categorical regression models (e.g., binary logistic, multinomial logistic) are used extensively to identify patterns of alcohol-related symptoms, screen for disorders, and assess policies. In addition, such models are used extensively in other areas of research such as mental illness, cancer, traumatic injuries, and AIDS-related pathologies. However, many such models are developed with inadequate support to fully analyze and exploit the intrinsically probabilistic nature of their results. This is of critical importance as health researchers, clinicians, and administrators are often faced with classification decisions using categorical regression models to identify unacceptable risks, adequate outcomes, and acceptable guidelines for screening, diagnoses, treatment, and quality of care. Commercially available statistical software does not offer sophisticated methods for robust estimation of posterior probabilities in the presence of model misspecification, missing covariates, and nonignorable missing data generating processes. Such robust missing data handling methods provide natural mechanisms for dealing with verification bias and modeling correlated, longitudinal, or survey data with complex sampling designs. Moreover, commercially available statistical software does not provide automated methods for using estimated posterior probabilities to make optimal classification decisions with respect to different optimality criteria. In particular, automated features such as optimizing multiple decision criteria (allocation rules) that trade off specificity against sensitivity, decision threshold confidence intervals, statistical tests for evaluating correct specification of posterior probabilities, statistical tests for comparing competing classifier thresholds, and methods for multi-outcome classification and inference are not readily available. Phase II research will extend Phase I findings for binary logistic regression to develop and implement automated robust classification methods for multinomial logistic regression modeling, which also applies to the larger class of nonlinear categorical regression models that output posterior probabilities. The Phase II software prototype will provide: 1) new user-selectable robust decision threshold estimators, 2) robust confidence intervals on decision threshold estimators, 3) new classifier threshold comparison tests, 4) new outcome probability specification tests, 5) efficient missing data handling methods in the presence of nonignorable nonresponse data, and 6) second-order analytic and simulation-based Bayesian methods for improved small sample and rare event outcome probability estimation. These new methodologies will be integrated into a prototype user-friendly software package, evaluated with extensive simulation studies, and then applied to real world classification problems encountered in: alcohol, mental illness (depression, bipolar, schizophrenia), cancer (prostate), trauma (emergency room), and infectious disease (AIDS) through collaborations with domain experts in those respective fields. In summary, Phase II research will establish the essential technical foundation for Phase III commercialization with the objective of providing a suite of new classification analysis methods as an advanced statistical tool that improves epidemiologic, clinical, and public health research.                 n/a",Robust Classification Methods for Categorical Regression,7917387,R44CA139607,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Agreement', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Industry', 'Information Resources Management', 'Injury', 'Jordan', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Preparation', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Robin bird', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'innovation', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prototype', 'public health research', 'simulation', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NCI,MARTINGALE RESEARCH CORPORATION,R44,2010,990520,0.0017211601952274154
"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

"Increasing Clinical Trial Enrollment: A Semi-Automated Patient Centered Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application. The study design is prospective observational study. Scope is limited to cancer patients. There are three specific aims for this project. The first aim is to identify concepts that overlap between the electronic medical record's (EMR) clinical notes and the free text of clinical trial announcements. The PI will use the concepts to develop mapping frames that connect concepts in the text of trial announcements to those found in clinical notes in the medical record. When he has the mapping frames he will build the NLP module for the application. In the software development work he will utilize as many publicly available software components as possible. He will experiment with UIMA, GATE, MetaMap, Stanford Parser, NegEx algorithm and others. The PI will develop the tool around the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System knowledgebase. He will use Java for programming. The second aim is to create an algorithm that automatically generates questions to request information directly from the patient if the information is not available or accessible in the records. The third aim is to evaluate the in-vitro, laboratory performance of the application. For performance evaluation purposes the PI will recruit cancer care specialists to generate the gold standard lists of eligible clinical trials for study patients. He will publicly release the developed code at the end of the grant period. This K99/R00 project will serve the foundation for future R01 grant applications. The PI is fully committed to become faculty in the Clinical Research Informatics domain with a specialization in biomedical NLP. The support of the K99/R00 grant will enable him to acquire substantial formal training in Computational Linguistics while contributing to the body of knowledge of the Clinical Research Informatics field. The five-year grant support will ensure success in his endeavor. The proposed work is highly significant because the dismal clinical trial accrual rates (2-4 % nationally) hampers timely development of new drugs. In addition, studies show that physicians have statistically significant bias against elderly and minority patients to invite participation in clinical trials. The proposed project is synergistic with physician-centered efforts but the goal is to provide individualized, EMR based clinical trial recommendations directly to the patients. The results of this research will empower the patients and elevate their role in the decision making process.           Relevance The long-term objective of this research is to increase the clinical trial enrollment of US patients via a semi- automated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) based, interactive and patient-centered informatics application.

"Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Early detection of disease outbreaks can decrease patient morbidity and mortality and minimize the spread of diseases. Early detection requires accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. One approach is biosurveillance, in which electronic symptom data are captured early in the course of illness, and analyzed for signals that might indicate an outbreak requiring investigation and response by the public health system. Emergency department (ED) patient records are particularly useful for biosurveillance, given their timely, electronic availability. ED data elements used in surveillance systems include the chief complaint (a brief description of the patient's primary symptom(s)), and triage nurses' note (also known as history of present illness).The chief complaint is the most widely used ED data element, because it is recorded electronically by the majority of EDs. One study showed that adding triage notes increased the sensitivity of biosurveillance case detection. The increased sensitivity is because the triage note increases the amount of data available: instead of one symptom in a chief complaint (e.g., fever), triage notes may contain multiple symptoms (e.g., ""fever, cough & shortness of breath for 12 hours""). Surveillance efforts are hampered, however, by the wide variability of free text data in ED chief complaints and triage notes. They often include misspellings, abbreviations, acronyms and other lexical and semantic variants that are difficult to group into symptom clusters (e.g., fever, temp 104, fvr, febrile). Tools are needed to address the lexical and semantic variation in symptom terms in ED data in order to improve biosurveillance. Natural language processing tools have been shown to facilitate concept extraction from more structured clinical data such as radiology reports, but there has been limited application of these techniques to free text ED triage notes. The project team developed the Emergency Medical Text Processor (EMT-P) to preprocess the chief complaint. EMT-P cleans and normalizes brief chief complaint entries and then extracts standardized concepts, but it is not sufficient in its current state to preprocess longer, more complex text passages such as triage notes. This proposed project will further strengthen biosurveillance by adapting EMT-P and other statistical and classical natural language processing tools to develop a system that extracts concepts from triage notes for biosurveillance.           Project Narrative Relevance: The public health system is responsible for monitoring large amounts of timely, electronic health data and needs more sophisticated tools to faciliate detection of, and response to, emerging infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism threats. The proposed project addresses this need by developing a system to extract relevant information from emergency department records.",Adapting Natural Language Processing Tools for Biosurveillance,7693117,G08LM009787,"['Abbreviations', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'American', 'Avian Influenza', 'Bioterrorism', 'Bird Flu vaccine', 'Breathing', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Coughing', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemiologist', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Hour', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'North Carolina', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pertussis', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smallpox', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Variant', 'acronyms', 'base', 'experience', 'improved', 'lexical', 'mortality', 'pandemic disease', 'population based', 'prototype', 'research to practice', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'syntax', 'tool']",NLM,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,G08,2009,145926,0.016224761262166522
"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7908952,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'meetings', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2009,170662,-0.030544485507276606
"Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The goals of our project are as follows:     1. Create a corpus of temporally annotated data. Under the supervision of our consultants Dr. Frank Sacks, Dr. Vincent Carey, and two Registered Nurses, we will create a gold-standard annotation of events and temporal information within patient narratives from de- identified Electronic Health Record data using the CLEF and TimeML guidelines. We will use the framework of the Brandeis Annotation Tool, a system we have designed to facilitate the quick construction of accurately annotated corpora against a specified guideline. Extensions to the current event library and lexicon with medical event references will be made during the annotation process, under the guidance of the Registered Nurses.          2. Adapt the TARSQI Toolkit (TTK) to targeted temporal properties and relations in the EHR domain. We will use the TARSQI toolkit, a robust set of temporal processing algorithms we have designed for parsing natural language text, to automatically annotate the events and temporal information in EHR data. Combined with the Brandeis AcroMed Medical Abbreviation Server and those terms introduced in part 1, we will employ the Specialist Lexicon and other medical resources to extend the toolkit capabilities for recognizing and interpreting medical event information. Algorithms for identifying events, temporal expressions, and event anchorings and orderings will be trained against the gold standard created in Aim 1, and tested against held-out data.     3. Create a cross-document temporal database of medical events. Using the recognition algorithms introduced in Aim 2, we will create a searchable, temporally ordered database of medical events such as diseases, symptoms, surgeries/interventions, and test results. Events referred to multiple times in the data will be merged using a constraint- satisfaction analysis in order to create a more coherent narrative for a single patient over multiple records.           Project Narrative It is becoming increasingly common for medical researchers to use Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as a primary source of data for researching correlations between various medical issues and concepts. However, EHRs typically contain unstructured text, making them difficult to mine. This research will create a database of temporal orderings from events extracted from EHR patient narratives, using algorithms previously applied to news articles.",Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries,7789943,R21LM009633,"['Abbreviations', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Authorization documentation', 'Body of uterus', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Libraries', 'Mining', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Property', 'Records', 'Registered nurse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'acronyms', 'base', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'interest', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'news', 'open source', 'repository', 'satisfaction', 'tool']",NLM,BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY,R21,2009,177750,0.010944463326138396
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7918614,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'natural language', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2009,185745,0.01386693859481852
"Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed work is to understand how learning by the visual system helps it to represent the immediate environment during perception. Because perception is accurate, we can know spatial layout: the shapes, orientations, sizes, and spatial locations of the objects and surfaces around us. But this accuracy requires that the visual system learn over time how best to interpret visual ""cues"". These cues are the signals from the environment that the visual system extracts from the retinal images that are informative about spatial layout. Known cues include binocular disparity, texture gradients, occlusion relations, motion parallax, and familiar size, to name a few. How do these cues come to be interpreted correctly? A fundamental problem is that visual cues are ambiguous. Even if cues could be measured exactly (which they cannot, the visual system being a physical device) there would still be different possible 3D interpretations for a given set of cues. As a result, the visual system is forced to operate probabilistically: the way things ""look"" to us reflects an implicit guess as to which interpretation of the cues is most likely to be correct. Each additional cue helps improve the guess. For example, the retinal image of a door could be interpreted as a vertical rectangle or as some other quadrilateral at a non-vertical orientation in space, and the shadow cues at the bottom of the door helps the system know that it's a vertical rectangle. What mechanisms do the visual system use to discern which cues are available for interpreting images correctly? The proposed work aims to answer this fundamental question about perceptual learning. It was recently shown that the visual system can detect and start using new cues for perception. This phenomenon can be studied in the laboratory using classical conditioning procedures that were previously developed to study learning in animals. In the proposed experiments, a model system is used to understand details about when this learning occurs and what is learned. The data will be compared to predictions based on older, analogous studies in the animal learning literature, and interpreted in the context of Bayesian statistical inference, especially machine learning theory. The proposed work benefits public health by characterizing the brain mechanisms that keep visual perception accurate. These mechanisms are at work in the many months during which a person with congenital cataracts learns to use vision after the cataracts are removed, and it is presumably these mechanisms that go awry when an individual with a family history of synesthesia or autism develops anomalous experience-dependent perceptual responses. Neurodegenerative diseases may disrupt visual learning, in which case visual learning tests could be used to detect disease; understanding the learning of new cues in human vision could lead to better computerized aids for the visually impaired; and knowing what causes a new cue to be learned could lead to new technologies for training people to perceive accurately in novel work environments.          n/a",Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception,7692268,R01EY013988,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Appearance', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cataract', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family history of', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rotation', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Vision Disparity', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'area MT', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'congenital cataract', 'design', 'devices for the visually impaired', 'experience', 'improved', 'meetings', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'stereoscopic', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual information', 'visual learning', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2009,228847,-0.04326306987972447
"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports. The results of this project will enable more effective medication safety surveillance efforts and thus will improve patient safety.",Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance,7691699,R01LM009623,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Angina Pectoris', 'Area', 'Body of uterus', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Group Identifications', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Information Technology', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Mandatory Reporting', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Electronics', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Cares', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'metathesaurus', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'phrases', 'post-market', 'practice-based research network', 'prevent', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2009,311821,-0.003984040839276021
"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7690941,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'meetings', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2009,351549,-0.030544485507276606
"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,7653874,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,357875,0.018158857668336074
"Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this three-year project, we aim to apply state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine (EBM) and comparative effectiveness reviews. We plan to develop a human guided computerized abstract screening tool to greatly reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. This tool will combine proven machine learning techniques with a new open source tool that enables management of the screening process. This new technology will enable investigators to screen abstracts in a small fraction of the time compared to the current manual process. It will reduce the time and cost of producing systematic reviews, provide clear documentation of the process and potentially perform the task more accurately. With the acceptance of EBM and increasing demands for systematic reviews, there is a great need for tools to assist in generating new systematic reviews and in updating them. This need cannot be more pressing. The recent passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the $1.1 billion allocated for comparative effectiveness research have created an unprecedented need for systematic reviews and opportunities to improve the methodologies and efficiency of their conduct.   We herein propose the development of novel, open-source software to help systematic reviewers better   cope with these torrents of data. The research and development of this tool will be carried out by a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators with computer scientists at Tufts University who began to collaborate last year as a result of Tufts being awarded one of the NIH Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). We will pursue dissemination of the new technology through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program, Cochrane Collaboration, CTSA network, and other groups conducting systematic reviews, and production of tutorial material. Our aims are:   1. Conduct research to design and implement a semi-automated system using machine learning and   information retrieval methods to identify relevant abstracts in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of systematic reviews.   2. Develop Abstrackr, an open-source system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for screening abstracts, that applies the methods developed in Aim 1 to automatically exclude irrelevant abstracts/articles.   3. Evaluate the performance of the active learning model developed in Aim 1 and the functionality of   Abstrackr developed in Aim 2 through application to a collection of manually screened datasets of   biomedical abstracts that will subsequently be made publicly available for use as a repository to spur   research in the machine learning and information retrieval communities.           Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making. Systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to build a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care.",Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews,7786337,R01HS018494,[' '],AHRQ,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2009,362692,0.016977726954905074

"Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10): Increasing Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions. Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced computational techniques, applied to complex, multidimensional, streaming, clinical data (historic, physiologic, laboratory, imaging, etc) from disparate health care digital data sources, can be used to produce integrated, higher level representations of critically ill patients for knowledge discovery and decision support for the 'next' patient. Vast amounts of digital health care data are available for real time computational analysis using artificial intelligence and statistical approaches such as data clustering and neural networks to ascertain relationships, determine 'diagnostic clusters' and trend outcomes of therapy in individual and groups of patients. While such algorithms have successful applications in business, industry, physical sciences and in parts of health care, several barriers exist for their broader application to intensive care medicine and other health care domains. Using AI and automated computational methodology we will develop algorithms for data mining raw medical data from disparate clinical data sources. This will enable understanding and  application of the most recent experiential information from large numbers of critically ill patients to find similarities between a current individual patient and historical, similar populations with known treatment outcomes. This will iteratively lead to a refined representation of the individual patient and guide patient management. This project is not merely the development of a database, although this is an essential precursor for the application of the advanced analytic techniques we will develop. It is ultimately about developing a framework to support the extraction, manipulation and construction of new views, relationships and information of and from observational clinical data from multiple sources to enable meaningful analysis and application at the patient's bedside. There are many open questions not sufficiently addressed about the translation of raw clinical data into an analytic computational infrastructure capable of providing bedside decision support. We will integrate expertise in medicine, computational mathematics and computer science to construct suitable data structures and develop AI computational techniques for analysis and presentation. Our goal is to advance the development of explicit methodology to bring analyzed comparative data to the bedside of critically ill children in real time to support clinical decision-making. Such a process will involve: 1.) transformation of patient-centric data across disparate platforms into a large relational database; 2.) construction of an integrated data model, assuring data integrity, structure and security; and finally, 3.) data analysis and presentation as meaningful comparative metrics that adequately characterize the time-based continuum of critical illness. Analytics can then be developed and algorithms refined that can be applied to severity of illness, prognostic, therapeutic, and anomaly detection in patients, hospital units, and national populations, thus painting a holistic picture of patients and populations. Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients. We will use advanced computational techniques and artificial intelligence to detect categories within raw medical data from disparate data sources allowing the most recent experiential information about large numbers of critically ill children to be mined to find similarities between the index case and historical cases with known outcomes. This will enable decision support for diagnosis, management, therapy and outcomes serving the functions of disease detection, direct patient care, quality, and safety.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients.

"DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY    Description (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Healthcare Data, 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions.    The lack of prescribing information and meaningful dosing guidance places an incredible burden on our pediatric caregivers with the end-result often the sub-optimal use of many medicines in children [1]. It is widely believed by the Institute of Medicine and American Association of Pediatrics that prescribing errors can be reduced via intelligent decision support systems that facilitate pharmacotherapy decision making [2]. We are developing drug-specific Pediatric Pharmacotherapy Decision Support Systems (PPDSS) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in an attempt to address these issues. Our goals for this system include the ability to: 1) provide dosing guidance consistent with formulary standard of care, 2) examine patient-specific pharmacotherapeutic indices with target agents relative to historical controls derived from the hospital data warehouse, 3) explore diagnoses - drug correlation in conjunction with utilization and 4) educate physicians on clinical pharmacologic principles specific to population and drug combinations of interest. Within this system, static compendial information (e.g., Lexi-Comp) can be searched, indexed and summarized for easy viewing; real-time, forecasting of relevant drug exposure or clinical markers (lab values, pharmacodynamics, adverse events) is made available based on interface to current patient data from our electronic medical records (EMR) system. Our long-term vision is to facilitate the safe and effective administration of drugs used in the treatment of children with an evolving collection of PPDSS providing improved management of patient pharmacotherapy.       The objective of this challenge grant application is to create a patient-based informatics system that contains the relevant guidance concerning dosing of specific agents to various pediatric subpopulations. This guidance will have the opportunity to grow (artificial intelligence) as patient diversity expands the historical experience (population priors) with an agent or combination of agents. This research application provides compelling evidence that clinical pharmacology driven decision support systems can interface with hospital EMR to provide individualized pharmacotherapy guidance. Our central hypothesis is that dosing guidance can be improved when the caregiver responsible for pharmacotherapy is informed in an expedient manner while in the process of patient care. The integration of well-characterized models that account for sources of variation in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and/or relationships with clinical outcomes is married with the most relevant clinical data associated with the management of a particular or combination of drug and disease states. The incoming clinical data streams can of course expand as new information becomes available (e.g., genomic data and guidance). Drug dashboards are designed for and by the physician therapeutic area in collaboration with Clinical Pharmacology and IT team members. Current prototype dashboards provide forecasting of drug exposure at select time points consistent with clinical protocols used to manage toxicity and efficacy. Forecasting tools permit dosing scenarios to be explored via a user-friendly interface that front-ends a pediatric population-based PK/PD model. By mobilizing the pediatric caregiver, clinical pharmacology and health IT sectors we envision a heightened appreciation for pharmacology-based decision support solutions and an evolving strategy to use such solutions to improve outcomes in children. The project brings together drug-specific decision support generated by our clinical pharmacology experts and clinical caregivers with predictive models generated by our pharmacometrics and informatics team. Drug dashboard prototypes for methotrexate (chemotherapeutic agent) and tacrolimus (used to prevent organ rejection) are under development and will be clinically evaluated prior to a production launch. The prediction engines and forecasting routines are transparent to the end-user; emphasis on clinical outcomes including reduced medication errors and length of hospital stay will be used to demonstrate the ROI for individual dashboards. Funding this application will ensure the generalizability of our data integration solution beyond CHOP boundaries, provide the appropriate test data to qualify/validate the prediction algorithms and generate the clinical experience with the PPDSS that will encourage other therapeutic areas and institutions to utilize the system. The solution (PPDSS dashboards and installation guidance) will be provided to all who request as part of our data-sharing plan.            Project Narrative The proposed research provides a mechanism to incorporate the most relevant prior knowledge into dosing guidance for an often understudied population - children. An important feature of the research is the incorporation of predictive models that provide real-time forecasting of patient response to existing therapy recommendations conditioned on prior patient experience with the potential to provide clinical scenario testing if the caregiver requests [3]. The initial dashboards developed as part of this proposal can easily be extended to accommodate other populations (elderly, pregnancy, etc) and expanded to include participation from additional caregiver stakeholders, clinical pharmacologists, bioinformatics scientists and pharmacometricians.",DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY,7825111,RC1LM010367,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Utilization', 'Drug usage', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Formularies', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Formularies', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Maps', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Qualifying', 'Quality Control', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'community planning', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'member', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,RC1,2009,494693,-0.02857807580729482
"Multi-source clinical Question Answering system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   / Abstract (Limit: 1 page) Our proposal addresses the following challenge area: 06-LM-101* Intelligent Search Tool for Answering Clinical Questions. Develop new computational approaches to information retrieval that would allow a clinician or clinical researcher to pose a single query that would result in search of multiple data sources to produce a coherent response that highlights key relevant information which may signal new insights for clinical research or patient care. Information that could help a clinician diagnose or manage a health condition, or help a clinical researcher explore the significance of issues that arise during a clinical trial, is scattered across many different types of resources, such as paper or electronic charts, trial protocols, published biomedical articles, or best-practice guidelines for care. Develop artificial intelligence and information retrieval approaches that allow a clinician or researcher confronting complex patient problems to pose a single query that will result in a search that appears to ""understand"" the question, a search that inspects multiple databases and brings findings together into a useful answer. Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab. The questions usually asked either require information highly specific to their patient, e.g. the patient's lab results or previous history, answered by the patient's health record, or a more general type of information usually answered through generally available information sources. QA systems enhance the results of search engines by providing a concise summary of relevant information along with source hits. PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) is the most ubiquitous biomedical search engine, however because it is a search engine the information retrieved is based on keyword searches and is not presented in a form for immediate consumption; the user has to drill down into the content of the webpages to find the facts/statements of interest. Moreover, the information that the clinician needs is likely to be of different types, for example a definition of a syndrome in combination with specific actions triggered by a particular diagnosis for a particular patient. Such information resides in different sources - encyclopedic and the EMR - and has to be dynamically accessed and presented to the user in an easily digestible format. We propose to develop a unified platform for clinical QA from multiple sources of clinical and biomedical narrative that implements semantic processing of the questions by fusing two existing technologies - the Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. The specific research questions we are aiming to answer are: ""How much effort is required to port a general semantic QA system to the clinical domain? How much additional domain-specific training is required? ""What is the accuracy of such a system? Question Answering in the clinical domain is an emerging area of research. The challenges in the field are mainly attributed to the number of components that require domain specific training along with strict system requirements in terms of high precision and recall complemented by an accessible and user-friendly presentation. Our approach to overcome them is to re-use components already in place as part of Mayo clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and the University of Colorado's Question Answering System. Our approach is innovative in bringing together information from encyclopedic sources and the EMR to present it into a unified form to the clinician at the point of care or the investigator in the lab. The technology for that is based on semantic language processing which aims at ""understanding"" the meaning of the question and the narrative. Our proposed system holds the potential to impact quality of healthcare and translational research. Our approach is feasible because it uses content already in the EMR at the Mayo Clinic along with general medical knowledge from multiple readily-available resources. The proposed system will be built off mature and tested components allowing a fast and robust delivery cycle. Our unique integration of technologies together with sophisticated statistical machine learning algorithms applied to rich linguistic knowledge about events, contradictions, semantic structure, and question-types, will allow us to build a system which significantly extends the range of possible question types and responses available to clinicians, and seamlessly fuses these to generate a response. Our proposed work represents a high impact area that has the potential to improve healthcare delivery because it addresses needs that have been well-documented and studied (Ely et al., 2005). We aim to provide a unified multi-source solution for semantic retrieval, access and summarization of relevant information at the point of care or the lab. As such, the proposed cQA has the potential to play a vital and important decision- support role for the physician or the biomedical investigator. (max 2-3 sentences) Clinical question answering (cQA) systems focus on the physician needs usually at the point of care, or the investigator in the lab.

"Natural Language Processing for Cancer Research Network Surveillance Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses Broad Challenge Area: (10) Information Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic: 10-CA-107 Expand Spectrum of Cancer Surveillance through Informatics Approaches. The proposed project launches a collaborative effort to advance adoption within the HMO Cancer Research Network (CRN) of ""industrial-strength"" natural language processing (NLP) systems useful for mining valuable, research-grade information from unstructured clinical text. Such text is available for processing, now in the electronic medical record (EMR) systems of affiliated CRN health plans. The proposed NLP methods   will create ongoing capacity to tap what has recently been described as ""a treasure trove of historical   unstructured data that provides essential information for the study of disease progression, treatment   effectiveness and long-term outcomes"" (5). The vision of advancing widespread NLP capacity across the CRN, as well as the approach we present here for implementing it, grew out of an in-depth strategic planning effort we completed in December 2008. That effort involved participants from six CRN sites guided by a blue-ribbon panel of NLP experts from three of the nation's leading centers of clinical NLP research: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Vanderbilt University, and Mayo Clinic. The vision is to deploy a powerful NLP system locally, manage it with newly hired and trained local NLP technical staff, and conduct NLP-based research projects initiated by local investigators, in consultation with higher-level external NLP experts. Our planning efforts suggest this collaborative model is feasible; we will test the model in the context of the proposed project. An important development in April 2009 yielded what we believe is a potentially transformative opportunity to accelerate adoption of NLP capacity in applied research settings: release of the open-source Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) software. This software was the result of a collaborative effort between IBM and Mayo Clinic. Built on the same framework Mayo Clinic currently uses to process its repository of over 40 million clinical documents, cTAKES dramatically lowers the cost of adopting a comprehensive and flexible NLP system. Deployment and use of such systems was previously only feasible in institutions with large, academically-oriented biomedical informatics research programs.   Still, other deployment challenges and the need to acquire NLP training for local staff present residual   barriers to adopting comprehensive NLP systems such as cTAKES. In collaboration with five other CRN sites the proposed project mitigates these challenges in two ways: 1) it develops configurable open-source software modules needed to streamline and therefore reduce the cost of deploying cTAKES, and 2) it presents and tests a model for training local staff through hands-on NLP projects overseen by outside NLP expert consultants. The potential impact of this project is evident most clearly in the vast untapped opportunities for text mining represented in CRN-affiliated health plans, where EMR systems have been in place since at least 2005, and whose patients represent 4% of the U.S. population. Clinical text mining offers the potential to provide new or improved data elements for cancer surveillance and other types of research requiring information about patient functional status, medication side-effects, details of therapeutic approaches, and differential information about clinical findings. Another significant impact of this project is its plan to integrate into the cTAKES system   an open-source de-identification tool based on state of the art, best of breed NLP approaches developed by the MITRE Corporation. De-identification of clinical text will make it easier for researchers to get access to clinical text, and will also facilitate multi-site collaborations while protecting patient privacy. Finally, if successful, the NLP algorithm we propose as a proof-of-principle project at Group Health-which will classify sets of patient charts as either containing or not containing a diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer-could dramatically reduce the cost of research in this area; currently all recurrent breast cancer endpoints must be established through costly manual chart abstraction.   Novel aspects of the proposed project include its talented and transdisciplinary research team,   including national experts in NLP, and its resourceful strategy for building the technical resources and ""human capital"" needed to support an ongoing program of applied NLP research. Natural language processing is itself a highly innovative technology; when successfully established in multiple CRN in the future it will represent a watershed moment in the CRN's already impressive history of exploiting data systems to support innovative research. Newly hired staff positions total approximately 2.0 FTE in each project year, most of which we anticipate will be supported by ongoing new research programs after the proposed project concludes. Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches. Because these methods are generic they will potentially contribute to public health by advancing research in a wide variety of areas. The ""proof of principle"" algorithm developed in the project to identify recurrent breast cancer diagnoses will advance epidemiologic and clinical research pertaining to the 2.5 million women currently living with breast cancer.           Project narrative The proposed project develops new measurement technologies for extracting information about disease processes and treatment, currently documented only in clinical text, based on natural language processing approaches.

"Robust Classification Methods for Categorical Regression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving statistical methods to provide better classification performance and new analytical capabilities for categorical regression would be invaluable to the medical and health care research communities. Categorical regression models (e.g., binary logistic, multinomial logistic) are used extensively to identify patterns of alcohol-related symptoms, screen for disorders, and assess policies. In addition, such models are used extensively in other areas of research such as mental illness, cancer, traumatic injuries, and AIDS-related pathologies. However, many such models are developed with inadequate support to fully analyze and exploit the intrinsically probabilistic nature of their results. This is of critical importance as health researchers, clinicians, and administrators are often faced with classification decisions using categorical regression models to identify unacceptable risks, adequate outcomes, and acceptable guidelines for screening, diagnoses, treatment, and quality of care. Commercially available statistical software does not offer sophisticated methods for robust estimation of posterior probabilities in the presence of model misspecification, missing covariates, and nonignorable missing data generating processes. Such robust missing data handling methods provide natural mechanisms for dealing with verification bias and modeling correlated, longitudinal, or survey data with complex sampling designs. Moreover, commercially available statistical software does not provide automated methods for using estimated posterior probabilities to make optimal classification decisions with respect to different optimality criteria. In particular, automated features such as optimizing multiple decision criteria (allocation rules) that trade off specificity against sensitivity, decision threshold confidence intervals, statistical tests for evaluating correct specification of posterior probabilities, statistical tests for comparing competing classifier thresholds, and methods for multi-outcome classification and inference are not readily available. Phase II research will extend Phase I findings for binary logistic regression to develop and implement automated robust classification methods for multinomial logistic regression modeling, which also applies to the larger class of nonlinear categorical regression models that output posterior probabilities. The Phase II software prototype will provide: 1) new user-selectable robust decision threshold estimators, 2) robust confidence intervals on decision threshold estimators, 3) new classifier threshold comparison tests, 4) new outcome probability specification tests, 5) efficient missing data handling methods in the presence of nonignorable nonresponse data, and 6) second-order analytic and simulation-based Bayesian methods for improved small sample and rare event outcome probability estimation. These new methodologies will be integrated into a prototype user-friendly software package, evaluated with extensive simulation studies, and then applied to real world classification problems encountered in: alcohol, mental illness (depression, bipolar, schizophrenia), cancer (prostate), trauma (emergency room), and infectious disease (AIDS) through collaborations with domain experts in those respective fields. In summary, Phase II research will establish the essential technical foundation for Phase III commercialization with the objective of providing a suite of new classification analysis methods as an advanced statistical tool that improves epidemiologic, clinical, and public health research.                 n/a",Robust Classification Methods for Categorical Regression,7686932,R44CA139607,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Agreement', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Industry', 'Information Resources Management', 'Injury', 'Jordan', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Policies', 'Preparation', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Robin bird', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'innovation', 'prototype', 'public health research', 'simulation', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NCI,MARTINGALE RESEARCH CORPORATION,R44,2009,957937,0.0017211601952274154
"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data.

"Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Microbial threats, including bioterrorism and naturally emerging infectious diseases, pose a serious challenge to national security in the United States and to health worldwide.  This proposal describes the creation of a center for computational modeling of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with the collaboration of key experts at the Brookings Institution, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the University of Maryland, and Imperial College (London).  The overarching aim of this project is to integrate the most advanced and powerful techniques of epidemiological data analysis with those of computer simulation (agent-based modeling) to produce a unified computational epidemiology that is scientifically sound, highly visual and user-friendly, and responsive to biosecurity and public health policy requirements.  Data analysis will be guided by the insight that epidemic patterns over space and time can be approached as nearly decomposable systems, in which frequency components of the incidence signal can be isolated and studied.  Wavelet transforms, and empiric mode decomposition using Hilbert-Huang Transforms, will be used to sift nonlinear, nonstationary epidemiological data, allowing frequency band patterns to be defined.  Isolated frequency modes will then be associated with external forcing (weather, social contact patterns) and internal dynamics (Kermack-McKendrick predator-prey models).  Results of the epidemiological data decomposition analysis, along with the knowledge of infectious disease experts, will instruct the creation and development of agent-based models.  Such models feature populations of mobile individuals in artificial societies that interact locally with other individuals.  Features of the basic model include variable social network structures, individual susceptibility and immunity, incubation periods, transmission rates, contact rates, and other selectable parameters.  After the agent-based model is calibrated to generate epidemic patterns consistent with real world epidemiology, preventive strategies including vaccination, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other public health measures will be systematically introduced and their impact evaluated.  Methods will be developed for assessing the utility of individual models, and for making decisions based on combined results from more than one model.  Infectious diseases to be studied initially include smallpox, SARS, dengue, West Nile, and unknown but hypothetically plausible agents.  As part of a Cooperative Agreement, the Center will work with other research groups, a bioinformatics core group, and the NIGMS to develop data sets, software and methods, agent-based models, and visualization tools.  In an infectious disease epidemic emergency the Center will redirect its activities to serve the nation's security, as guided by the NIGMS. n/a",Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats,7688793,U01GM070708,"['AIDS therapy', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Academy', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Airborne Particulate Matter', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Americas', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Appendix', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arthropod Vectors', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioterrorism', 'Books', 'Borrelia', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Contact Tracing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Demography', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Earthquakes', 'Ecology', 'Economics', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ehrlichia', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Encephalitis', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering technology', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Foot-and-Mouth Disease', 'Frequencies', 'Game Theory', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Hantavirus', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis E', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hygiene', 'Imagery', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Informatics', 'Information Services', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Leptospira', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'London', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malaria', 'Maryland', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mathematical Biology', 'Mathematics', 'Measles', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Modified Smallpox', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'National Security', 'New York', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Observational Study', 'Oceanography', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Physical Dialysis', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prion Diseases', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Public Policy', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Quarantine', 'Rate', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reference Standards', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rickettsia', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Schedule', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Security', 'Series', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Smallpox', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Space Flight', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Tropical Medicine', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Violence', 'Viral', 'Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Weather', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'base', 'biosecurity', 'c new', 'college', 'computer science', 'concept', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'editorial', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infectious disease model', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'microbial', 'models and simulation', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'peer', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'remote sensing', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social organization', 'sound', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly', 'vaccination strategy']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2008,58299,0.007852872895367163
"Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software with Automated Gating    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software Project described in this grant application is designed to create a new, more efficient and effective way of analyzing cells for the presence of cancer, HIV/AIDS and other disease, using a fully automated software system. Using modern data mining techniques (pattern recognition, feature recognition, image analysis) we will design software which will analyze data (the cell samples from patients) at a much faster rate and with fewer false positives and negatives than the manual method now in use. Objectives: Assemble and validate algorithms in software that can automatically classify regions of interest in flow cytometry data. We will demonstrate that the particular populations required by our use cases can be validly, rigorously and repeatably identified automatically. Develop and validate graphical and statistical results that satisfy FDA requirements for medical device software, simplify regulatory compliance by the clinical user, and automatically deliver analysis results to diagnostic expert systems and/or LIMS systems. Satisfy the  translational medicine  goals outlined in the NIH Roadmap. This software will bring the clinician streamlined testing currently only available in research labs. Methods: Four use cases have been selected, one employing synthetic data and three clinical data; Leukemia/Lymphoma test, Analysis of longitudinal Graft vs. Host Disease (GvHD) in bone marrow transplant specimens for predictive markers and HIV/AIDS - Gag-specific T cell cytokine response profile assay. For each we have access to a substantial body of existing data, analyzed by experts. Beginning with the autogating routines in our own FlowJo software, we will test and expand the application of Magnetic gating, Probability Clustering, Subtractive Cluster Analysis, Artificial Neural and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Using a sampling of human operators to establish a control range, we will test each of these five techniques against the four use cases in cooperation with our collaborators. Events in the manually classified samples are given a weighted score based on the frequency with which they are included by all the operators. A single operator's score or the gating algorithm's score is compared with the cumulative score of the expert group and a match rating is computed. Additional validation techniques include combinatory validation on internal measures with respect to Pareto optimality, and Predictive Power/Stability self consistency checks using resampled or perturbed data measured with external indices such as the adjusted Rand index and the Variation of Information index.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By eliminating the operator's time, we estimate that the cost of clinical flow cytometry analysis can be reduced to half the current figure while delivering the results much faster. By eliminating the subjectivity and human error of manually created regions and reducing the range of variability of the so created, there would result fewer false positives and false negatives, improving the clinical outcome for those patients needing therapy but undetected by current methods. An order of magnitude increase in speed means faster therapeutic intervention.  A less expensive test improves outcome by making the test accessible to more patients.          n/a",Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software with Automated Gating,7482923,R43RR024094,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Files', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gagging', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Voting', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NCRR,"TREE STAR, INC.",R43,2008,100854,-0.026280590560597884
"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The common goals to many, if not all, biomedical research programs are the development of tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

"Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed work is to understand how learning by the visual system helps it to represent the immediate environment during perception. Because perception is accurate, we can know spatial layout: the shapes, orientations, sizes, and spatial locations of the objects and surfaces around us. But this accuracy requires that the visual system learn over time how best to interpret visual ""cues"". These cues are the signals from the environment that the visual system extracts from the retinal images that are informative about spatial layout. Known cues include binocular disparity, texture gradients, occlusion relations, motion parallax, and familiar size, to name a few. How do these cues come to be interpreted correctly? A fundamental problem is that visual cues are ambiguous. Even if cues could be measured exactly (which they cannot, the visual system being a physical device) there would still be different possible 3D interpretations for a given set of cues. As a result, the visual system is forced to operate probabilistically: the way things ""look"" to us reflects an implicit guess as to which interpretation of the cues is most likely to be correct. Each additional cue helps improve the guess. For example, the retinal image of a door could be interpreted as a vertical rectangle or as some other quadrilateral at a non-vertical orientation in space, and the shadow cues at the bottom of the door helps the system know that it's a vertical rectangle. What mechanisms do the visual system use to discern which cues are available for interpreting images correctly? The proposed work aims to answer this fundamental question about perceptual learning. It was recently shown that the visual system can detect and start using new cues for perception. This phenomenon can be studied in the laboratory using classical conditioning procedures that were previously developed to study learning in animals. In the proposed experiments, a model system is used to understand details about when this learning occurs and what is learned. The data will be compared to predictions based on older, analogous studies in the animal learning literature, and interpreted in the context of Bayesian statistical inference, especially machine learning theory. The proposed work benefits public health by characterizing the brain mechanisms that keep visual perception accurate. These mechanisms are at work in the many months during which a person with congenital cataracts learns to use vision after the cataracts are removed, and it is presumably these mechanisms that go awry when an individual with a family history of synesthesia or autism develops anomalous experience-dependent perceptual responses. Neurodegenerative diseases may disrupt visual learning, in which case visual learning tests could be used to detect disease; understanding the learning of new cues in human vision could lead to better computerized aids for the visually impaired; and knowing what causes a new cue to be learned could lead to new technologies for training people to perceive accurately in novel work environments.          n/a",Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception,7388324,R01EY013988,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Appearance', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cataract', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Depth', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family history of', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Rate', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rotation', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Vision Disparity', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'area MT', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'concept', 'congenital cataract', 'design', 'devices for the visually impaired', 'experience', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'size', 'stereoscopic', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual information', 'visual learning', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2008,228847,-0.04326306987972447
"Sematic Relatedness for Active Medication Safety and Outcomes Surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Medication-related morbidity and mortality in ambulatory care in the United States results in estimated 100,000 deaths and $177 billion spending annually. Post-marketing passive surveillance of outcomes associated with medication use has been recognized as a necessary component in drug safety monitoring to overcome the limitations of pre- marketing clinical trials. Information technology applied to the patient's electronic medical and therapeutic record holds promise to improve this situation by detecting alarming trends in signs and symptoms in patient populations exposed to the same medication. Currently, much of the information necessary for active drug safety surveillance is ""locked"" in the unstructured text of electronic records. Our long-term goal is to develop information technology to recognize and prevent drug therapy related adverse events. Sophisticated natural language processing systems have been developed to find medical terms and their synonyms in the unstructured text and use them to retrieve information. In order to monitor alarming trends in symptoms in medical records, we need mechanisms that will allow not only accurate term and concept identification but also grouping of semantically related concepts that may not necessarily be synonymous. Measures of semantic relatedness rely on existing ontologies of domain knowledge as well as large textual corpora to compute a numeric score indicating the strength of relatedness between two concepts. Our central hypothesis is that such measures will be able to make fine-grained distinctions among concepts in the biomedical text, and provide a foundation upon which to organize concepts into meaningful groups automatically. In particular, this proposal seeks to develop methods that leverage the medical knowledge contained within Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and corpora of clinical text. Our short-term goals are 1) develop new methods, specific to clinical text, for computing semantic relatedness 2) integrate these specific methods for computing semantic relatedness into more general methods of natural language processing 3) integrate semantic relatedness into methods for identifying labeled semantic relations in clinical text. Labeled relations significantly enhance the ability of natural language processing to support accurate automatic analysis of medical information for improving patient safety. Our next step will be to develop and validate a generalizable active medication safety surveillance system that will automatically track medication exposure and alarming trends in signs and symptoms in ambulatory and hospitalized populations for a broad range of diseases.           This project will a) create and validate a common open-source platform for developing and testing semantic relatedness measures, b) determine the validity of electronic medical records with respect to identification of symptoms associated with medication- related problems and c) develop a novel methodology to aggregate adverse reaction terms used to code spontaneous post-marketing drug safety surveillance reports.

"Robust computational framework for predictive ADME-Tox modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This proposal seeks to establish a universally applicable and robust predictive ADME-Tox modeling framework based on rigorous Quantitative Structure Activity/Property Relationships (QSAR/QSPR) modeling. The framework has been refined in the course of many years of our research in the areas of QSPR methodology development and application to experimental datasets that led to novel analytical approaches, descriptors, model validation schemes, overall QSPR workflow design, and multiple end-point studies. This proposal focuses on the design of optimized QSPR protocols for the development of reliable predictors of critically important ADME-Tox properties. The ADME properties will include, but not limited to, water solubility, membrane permeability, P450 metabolism inhibition and induction, metabolic stability, human intestinal absorption, bioavailability, transporters and PK data; a variety of toxicological end-points vital to human health will be explored; they are available from recent initiatives on development and standardization of toxicity data, such as the US FDA, NIEHS, and EPA DSS-Tox and other database projects. The ultimate goal of this project is sharing both modeling software and specialized predictors with the research community via a web-based Predictive ADME-Tox Portal. The project objectives will be achieved via concurrent development of QSPR methodology (Specific Aim 1), building highly predictive, robust QSPR models of known ADME-Tox properties (Specific Aim 2), and the deployment of both modeling software and individual predictors via a specialized web-portal (Specific Aim 3). To achieve the goals of this project focusing on the development and delivery of specialized tools and rigorous predictors, we have assembled a research team of mostly senior investigators with complimentary skills and track records of accomplishment in the areas of computational drug discovery, experimental toxicology, statistical modeling, and software development and integration; two of the team members have had recent industrial experience before transitioning to academia. To the best of our knowledge, the results of this proposal will lead to the first publicly available in silico ADME-Tox modeling framework and predictors that can be used by the research community to analyze any set of chemicals (i.e., virtual and real compound sets). The framework will have a significant impact on compound prioritization, chemical library design, and candidate selection for preclinical and clinical development.            n/a",Robust computational framework for predictive ADME-Tox modeling,7433931,R21GM076059,"['Academia', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Area', 'Biological Availability', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Drug Kinetics', 'End Point', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Statistically Significant', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'carcinogenicity', 'career', 'cluster computing', 'combinatorial', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'genotoxicity', 'innovation', 'knowledge of results', 'member', 'method development', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'open source', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'protocol development', 'reproductive', 'skills', 'small molecule libraries', 'software development', 'tool', 'virtual', 'water solubility']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2008,322087,-0.017291737962217196
"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7502749,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Numbers', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'mecarzole', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2008,352226,-0.030544485507276606
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions. The major innovation is the generation of complex search strategies that exploit this contextual information, based on studies of human searching experts (reference librarians).              n/a",Answering Information Needs in Workflow,7675157,R01LM008799,"['Address', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'day', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'preference', 'speech processing', 'symposium']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2008,354823,0.01386693859481852

"Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Microbial threats, including bioterrorism and naturally emerging infectious diseases, pose a serious challenge to national security in the United States and to health worldwide.  This proposal describes the creation of a center for computational modeling of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with the collaboration of key experts at the Brookings Institution, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the University of Maryland, and Imperial College (London).  The overarching aim of this project is to integrate the most advanced and powerful techniques of epidemiological data analysis with those of computer simulation (agent-based modeling) to produce a unified computational epidemiology that is scientifically sound, highly visual and user-friendly, and responsive to biosecurity and public health policy requirements.  Data analysis will be guided by the insight that epidemic patterns over space and time can be approached as nearly decomposable systems, in which frequency components of the incidence signal can be isolated and studied.  Wavelet transforms, and empiric mode decomposition using Hilbert-Huang Transforms, will be used to sift nonlinear, nonstationary epidemiological data, allowing frequency band patterns to be defined.  Isolated frequency modes will then be associated with external forcing (weather, social contact patterns) and internal dynamics (Kermack-McKendrick predator-prey models).  Results of the epidemiological data decomposition analysis, along with the knowledge of infectious disease experts, will instruct the creation and development of agent-based models.  Such models feature populations of mobile individuals in artificial societies that interact locally with other individuals.  Features of the basic model include variable social network structures, individual susceptibility and immunity, incubation periods, transmission rates, contact rates, and other selectable parameters.  After the agent-based model is calibrated to generate epidemic patterns consistent with real world epidemiology, preventive strategies including vaccination, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other public health measures will be systematically introduced and their impact evaluated.  Methods will be developed for assessing the utility of individual models, and for making decisions based on combined results from more than one model.

"Robust Classification Methods for Categorical Regression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving statistical methods to provide better classification performance and new analytical capabilities for categorical regression would be invaluable to the medical and health care research communities. Categorical regression models (e.g., binary logistic, multinomial logistic) are used extensively to identify patterns of alcohol-related symptoms, screen for disorders, and assess policies. In addition, such models are used extensively in other areas of research such as mental illness, cancer, traumatic injuries, and AIDS-related pathologies. However, many such models are developed with inadequate support to fully analyze and exploit the intrinsically probabilistic nature of their results. This is of critical importance as health researchers, clinicians, and administrators are often faced with classification decisions using categorical regression models to identify unacceptable risks, adequate outcomes, and acceptable guidelines for screening, diagnoses, treatment, and quality of care. Commercially available statistical software does not offer sophisticated methods for robust estimation of posterior probabilities in the presence of model misspecification, missing covariates, and nonignorable missing data generating processes. Such robust missing data handling methods provide natural mechanisms for dealing with verification bias and modeling correlated, longitudinal, or survey data with complex sampling designs. Moreover, commercially available statistical software does not provide automated methods for using estimated posterior probabilities to make optimal classification decisions with respect to different optimality criteria. In particular, automated features such as optimizing multiple decision criteria (allocation rules) that trade off specificity against sensitivity, decision threshold confidence intervals, statistical tests for evaluating correct specification of posterior probabilities, statistical tests for comparing competing classifier thresholds, and methods for multi-outcome classification and inference are not readily available. Phase II research will extend Phase I findings for binary logistic regression to develop and implement automated robust classification methods for multinomial logistic regression modeling, which also applies to the larger class of nonlinear categorical regression models that output posterior probabilities. The Phase II software prototype will provide: 1) new user-selectable robust decision threshold estimators, 2) robust confidence intervals on decision threshold estimators, 3) new classifier threshold comparison tests, 4) new outcome probability specification tests, 5) efficient missing data handling methods in the presence of nonignorable nonresponse data, and 6) second-order analytic and simulation-based Bayesian methods for improved small sample and rare event outcome probability estimation. These new methodologies will be integrated into a prototype user-friendly software package, evaluated with extensive simulation studies, and then applied to real world classification problems encountered in: alcohol, mental illness (depression, bipolar, schizophrenia), cancer (prostate), trauma (emergency room), and infectious disease (AIDS) through collaborations with domain experts in those respective fields. In summary, Phase II research will establish the essential technical foundation for Phase III commercialization with the objective of providing a suite of new classification analysis methods as an advanced statistical tool that improves epidemiologic, clinical, and public health research.                 n/a",Robust Classification Methods for Categorical Regression,7395177,R44CA139607,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Agreement', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Industry', 'Information Resources Management', 'Injury', 'Jordan', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Policies', 'Preparation', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Robin bird', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'innovation', 'prototype', 'simulation', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NCI,MARTINGALE RESEARCH CORPORATION,R44,2008,857168,0.0017211601952274154
"Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text emerging trend in computational linguistics is melding natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to help computers make sense of human-generated free text. The blending of these disciplines is relatively rare in biomedical inforrnatics. Past medical NLP/ML research work is biased heavily towards linguistic methods that attempt to reason about grammar and syntax aided by a domain-focal knowledge base (e.g., one for radiology or one for clinical pathology). The aim of the work proposed here takes a different tack: exploring the utility of a statistical approach to clinical NLP, one augmented by machine learning and concentrating on general progress notes from across multiple clinical domains. The specific clinical goal will be to identify adverse drug events described implicitly or explicitly in inpatient progress notes. Rather than relying on a narrow domain focus to provide enough context restriction to make text interpretation tractable, this approach will use statistical patterns in note author information (e.g., profession, note type, treating ward) and patient information (e.g., admit diagnosis, procedures performed, temporal note relationships) for context restriction. The research component of this proposal is divided into two categories: three small-scale projects designed to rapidly hone new skills developed under the training component, and a large-scale project that assesses the feasibility of cross-discipline clinical text analysis. n/a",Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text,6944955,F38LM008478,"['Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Inpatients', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Statistical Study', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'experience', 'knowledge base', 'skills', 'syntax', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'ward']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F38,2007,38768,0.012198457318687595
"TIME:(Tools for Inpatient Monitoring using Evidence)for Safe & AppropriateTesting The MOMENT (Monitoring for Outpatient Medication Effects and New Toxicities) in TIME project will extend the in-progress TIME (Tools for Inpatient Monitoring using Evidence) for Safe and Appropriate Testing grant, #5 R01 LM007995-03, by developing sophisticated text-mining and data extraction tools to examine adverse drug effects in patients presenting for emergency and hospital care. Using a UMLS-based concept identifier enhanced with natural language processing, the MOMENT project will detect: (a) individual clinical manifestations (symptoms and physical exam findings) that are potentially drug related; (b) clinical syndromes (e.g., hepatoxicity, myopathy, renal insufficiency, glucose intolerance); and, (c) and clinical diseases (such as systemic lupus induced by hydralazine or procainamide, or acute myocardial infarction associated with rofecoxib). Innovative aspects of the proposed work include use of advanced natural language processing techniques to abstract concepts representing potential drug effects from patient history and physical examination records and ancillary test reports, the combination of evidence- based templates and diagnostic algorithms to detect complex patterns of drug toxicity (e.g., hepatocelluar damage, pulmonary fibrosis, or acute coronary syndrome), advanced statistical methods for determining medication effects in large populations, and utilization of a clinical database containing data on more than 100,000 patients. Public Statement The MOMENT project (Monitoring for Outpatient Medication Effects and New Toxicities) will demonstrate the feasibility of combining informatics applications increasingly present in many healthcare institutions - electronic medical record systems and care provider order entry (CPOE) systems - to create an advanced detection and monitoring system for adverse medication effects.

"Developing computerized tools for cryosurgery planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Cryosurgery has been known as an invasive surgical technique since 1961, when Cooper and Lee invented the first cryoprobe. In the 1990s, new developments in Joule-Thomson cooling (the cooling effect associated with a sudden relief of a pressurized gas) led to a dramatic decrease in the size of cryoprobes and an increase in the number of cryoprobes that could be used simultaneously. A dozen or more cryoprobes operating simultaneously in a single prostate cryosurgery is already common practice. If localized effectively, one of the primary benefits of using a large number of miniaturized cryoprobes is superior control over the freezing process.   Currently, the process of selecting the correct placement of the cryoprobes for a specific procedure is an art held by the cryosurgeon, based on the surgeon's own experience and rules of thumb. Cryoprobes are typically operated in a trial-and-error fashion, until the entire target volume is thought to be frozen. Currently, there are no means to determine the optimal locations for the cryoprobes. Suboptimal cryoprobe localization may leave regions in the target volume unfrozen, may lead to cryoinjury of healthy surrounding tissues, may require an unnecessarily large number of cryoprobes, may increase the duration of the surgical procedure, and may increase the likelihood of post cryosurgery complications, all of which affect the quality and cost of the medical treatment. Computerized planning tools would help to alleviate these difficulties.   The ""cryoheater,"" a new device for cryosurgery control has recently been presented by the research team. The cryoheater is a temperature controlled electrical heater. In broad terms, cryoheaters can dramatically increase the ability to control the shape and size of the frozen region, however, to achieve the full benefits of cryoheaters, computerized planning tools for cryoheater localization are necessary.   Our goal is to develop computerized planning tools for cryosurgery that are suitable for all available cooling techniques. The proposed research includes: (1) Development of an efficient numerical scheme for bioheat transfer simulations of cyroprocedures, (2) Development of an efficient optimization technique based on a force-field analogy.

(4) Experimental verification of the planning tool.       Besides planning, another important application of the proposed tool is the training of cryosurgeons. The proposed tool will provide cryosurgeons with the ability to visualize the 3D volumetric nature of the freezing process.   Likewise, it will allow the surgeon to explore the performance of various configurations of cryoprobes and cryoheaters, and observe the defects that would result from each.

"Automated Detection of Medical Errors DESCRIPTION:    The long-term goal of this proposal is to use the electronic medical record, including narrative text, to understand and encode the process of care for individual patients in order to improve patient safety.   Achieving this goal has the potential to help detect adverse events, and to differentiate medical errors from appropriately tailored care. The specific aims for this proposal are as follows: 1) To understand and encode the process of care for individual patients using data in the electronic medical record, including narrative text.   2) To use a more detailed understanding of patients' processes of care to improve automated adverse event detection. 3) To match processes of care for individual patients against accepted care pathways in order to identify discrepancies. We will capitalize on three core technologies that are in active use by clinicians and researchers in our busy clinical setting: 1) a Web-based clinical information system and its associated clinical data repository (WebCIS), 2) a full medical language parser (MedLEE), and 3) a semi-structured, electronic physician documentation system built by the applicant specifically to support this project (eNote).   Methods will include evaluating the performance (sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value) of our system, DETER+MINE (DETecting ERrors Mining Narrative Electronically), to model the care process and detect adverse events and pathway deviations. We will utilize explicit process criteria and manual, retrospective chart review as a gold standard.   This research is intended to provide proof of concept that combining natural language processing of clinical narrative with traditional sources of coded data is required for effective screening with automated defection systems. This approach has the potential to impact significantly on our ability to detect and investigate medical errors, adverse medical events, and pathway deviations by reducing reliance on costly and slow manual chart reviews. n/a",Automated Detection of Medical Errors,7282343,K22LM008805,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Applications Grants', 'Caring', 'Causations', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Language', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Negligence', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Range', 'Recommendation', 'Reliance', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source Code', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States', 'base', 'computerized', 'concept', 'experience', 'improved', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K22,2007,135000,0.005435513841402998
"Least Angle Regression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR project aims to produce superior methods and software for classification and regression when there are many potential predictor variables to choose from. The methods should (1) produce stable results, where small changes in the data do not produce major changes in the variables selected or in model predictions; (2) produce accurate predictions; (3) facilitate scientific interpretation, by selecting a smaller subset of predictors which provide the best predictions; (4) allow continuous and categorical variables; and (5) support linear regression, logistic regression (predicting a binary outcome), survival analysis, and other types of regression. This project is based on least angle regression, which unifies and provides a fast implementation for a number of modern regression techniques. Least angle regression has great potential, but currently available software is limited in scope and robustness. The outcome of this project should be software which is more robust and widely applicable. This software would apply broadly, including to medical diagnosis, detecting cancer, feature selection in microarrays, and modeling patient characteristics like blood pressure. Phase I work demonstrates feasibility by extending least angle work in three key directions-categorical predictors, logistic regression, and a numerically-accurate implementation. Phase II goals include extensions to other types of explanatory variables (e.g. polynomial or spline functions, and interactions between variables), to survival and other additional regression models, and to handle missing data and massive data sets. This proposed software will enable medical researchers to obtain high prediction accuracy, and obtain stable and interpretable results, in high-dimensional situations. Predicting outcomes based on covariates, determining which covariates most affect outcomes, and adjusting treatment effects estimates for covariates, are among the most important problems in biostatistics. Prediction and feature selection are particularly difficult when there are more possible features than samples; gene microarrays and protein mass spectrometry are extreme examples of this, producing thousands to millions of measurements per sample.

"Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid and accurate triage is essential when dealing with acutely injured persons. To that end, a number of trauma triage decision aids have been proposed. Unfortunately, mistriage rates for trauma patients remain high, due in part to aids that lack precision or discrimination, are not used, or are misused or misapplied. Improving the trauma triage process is an important problem because doing so improves trauma triage outcomes by optimizing access to and utilization of specialized resources as well as reducing morbidity and mortality. A promising method for improving this process is to integrate machine learning algorithms as a rapid and accurate clinical decision support technique. Machine learning techniques have been used to develop rules to diagnosis myocardial infarction and to provide rapid and accurate decision support in nonmedical settings. They have also been used to predict mortality following injury. Furthermore, using machine learning algorithms for clinical decision support employs highly accurate predictive models to counter the previously mentioned pitfalls of existing trauma decision aids in the following ways: (1) collecting relevant readily available clinical information, (2) choosing the most accurate predictive model for the situation at hand, and (3) utilizing computational speed and power to optimize predictive accuracy. The goal of this AREA proposal is to test the feasibility of machine learning-based predictive modeling techniques to support trauma triage. We plan to use well-established predictive model development and evaluation techniques to: (1) Compare the existing American College of Surgeons trauma triage decision aid to four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques; (2) Compare the performance of four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques with and without a novel measure of change in physiological status; and (3) Compare the performance of full machine learning models to those derived using information gathered as a byproduct of the workflow. Models will predict persons with severe injury or need for specialized trauma resources. Successful integration of machine learning algorithms is a first step toward developing an adaptive computer assisted trauma triage system that not only helps clinicians make better decisions but also facilitates rapid access to specialized resources.           n/a",Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT),7252385,R15GM080697,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Records', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Numbers', 'Operating Rooms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Speed', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'injured', 'innovation', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA,R15,2007,216300,0.0031773438960259848
"LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The high cost ($0.8 - $1.7 billion) and long time frames (about 13 years) required to introduce new drugs to the market contributes substantially to spiraling health care costs and diseases persisting without effective cures. A major factor is the high attrition rate of new compounds failing due to toxicity identified years into clinical trials. This particular circumstance cost the pharmaceutical industry approximately $8 billion in 2003. In silico tools generally offer the promise of identifying toxicity issues much more rapidly than clinical methods, however, they are not sufficiently accurate for pharmaceutical companies to confidently make definitive early screening and related investment decisions. LiverTox is a highly advanced, self-learning liver toxicity prediction tool that represents a quantum leap over current in silico methods. It offers a highly innovative use of multiple analytical approaches to accurately predict the toxicity of candidate Pharmaceuticals in the liver. A differentiating capability is its self-learning computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets. They rapidly assimilate massive volumes of information from LiverTox's extensive, dynamic, and thoroughly reviewed databases. Initially, LiverTox will generate predictions derived from five independent CNN-based submodules; one trained in advanced computational chemistry methods to make quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses; a second trained with microarray data; a third trained with Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing and Gene Expression (MPSS/GE) data; and fourth and fifth submodules trained with proteomics and metabolomics/metabonomics data, respectively. Challenging LiverTox with new chemical formulations triggers the five independent submodules to each make toxicity endpoint predictions drawing upon its knowledge base and its similarity analysis/fuzzy logic/statistical training. This tool's flexible, highly advanced system architecture and advanced learning capabilities using data obtained from diverse techniques enable it to rapidly digest new data, build upon new data acquisition techniques, and use prior lessons learned to achieve overall toxicity predictions with greater than 95% accuracy. LiverTox's ability to rapidly and accurately predict the toxicity of drug candidates will allow pharmaceutical companies to move from discovery to curing disease faster, at greatly reduced cost, and with less reliance on animal-based tests.         n/a",LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction,7214118,R42ES013321,"['Accounting', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug toxicity', 'End Point', 'Expert Systems', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Gene Expression', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'highly advanced system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'metabolomics', 'quantum', 'serial analysis of gene expression', 'subtraction hybridization', 'tool']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R42,2007,257269,-0.01820761404302385

"Robust computational framework for predictive ADME-Tox modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This proposal seeks to establish a universally applicable and robust predictive ADME-Tox modeling framework based on rigorous Quantitative Structure Activity/Property Relationships (QSAR/QSPR) modeling. The framework has been refined in the course of many years of our research in the areas of QSPR methodology development and application to experimental datasets that led to novel analytical approaches, descriptors, model validation schemes, overall QSPR workflow design, and multiple end-point studies. This proposal focuses on the design of optimized QSPR protocols for the development of reliable predictors of critically important ADME-Tox properties. The ADME properties will include, but not limited to, water solubility, membrane permeability, P450 metabolism inhibition and induction, metabolic stability, human intestinal absorption, bioavailability, transporters and PK data; a variety of toxicological end-points vital to human health will be explored; they are available from recent initiatives on development and standardization of toxicity data, such as the US FDA, NIEHS, and EPA DSS-Tox and other database projects. The ultimate goal of this project is sharing both modeling software and specialized predictors with the research community via a web-based Predictive ADME-Tox Portal. The project objectives will be achieved via concurrent development of QSPR methodology (Specific Aim 1), building highly predictive, robust QSPR models of known ADME-Tox properties (Specific Aim 2), and the deployment of both modeling software and individual predictors via a specialized web-portal (Specific Aim 3). To achieve the goals of this project focusing on the development and delivery of specialized tools and rigorous predictors, we have assembled a research team of mostly senior investigators with complimentary skills and track records of accomplishment in the areas of computational drug discovery, experimental toxicology, statistical modeling, and software development and integration; two of the team members have had recent industrial experience before transitioning to academia. To the best of our knowledge, the results of this proposal will lead to the first publicly available in silico ADME-Tox modeling framework and predictors that can be used by the research community to analyze any set of chemicals (i.e., virtual and real compound sets). The framework will have a significant impact on compound prioritization, chemical library design, and candidate selection for preclinical and clinical development.            n/a",Robust computational framework for predictive ADME-Tox modeling,7244058,R21GM076059,"['Academia', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Area', 'Biological Availability', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Drug Kinetics', 'End Point', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Statistically Significant', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'carcinogenicity', 'career', 'cluster computing', 'combinatorial', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'genotoxicity', 'innovation', 'knowledge of results', 'member', 'method development', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'open source', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'protocol development', 'reproductive', 'skills', 'small molecule libraries', 'software development', 'tool', 'virtual', 'water solubility']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2007,328325,-0.017291737962217196
"Answering Information Needs in Workflow    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Needs for information arise continuously during the course of clinical practice, especially for physicians in training, e.g. when examining a patient or participating in rounds. In most of these situations, it is difficult or impossible for the clinician to immediately access appropriate information resources. Most needs are never adequately articulated or recorded, and consequently are forgotten by the end of the day. Moreover, when clinicians do recall information needs, they don't act on them, due to the significant limitations of current retrieval systems and the exigencies of clinical practice. The specific aims of the proposed project are: 1) to capture information needs in a convenient manner at the moment they occur using different modalities such as text input and voice capture on hand-held devices, 2) to translate high-level information needs into complex search strategies that adapt to user needs and are tuned to the capabilities of resources, and 3) to deliver relevant materials to the clinician in an accessible format and in a timely manner. The project will develop a central hub for addressing the information needs of medical students and residents, to be transmitted electronically as they occur in the field. A unique feature of the project is the use of natural language processing technology to identify context, goals and preferences in clinicians' questions.

"HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians have many questions when seeing patients. Primary care physicians are reported to generate between 0.7 and 18.5 questions for every 10 patient visits. The published medical literature is an important resource helping physicians to access up-to-date clinical information and thereby to enhance the quality of patient care. For example, the case study in the above example (i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatment for cellulites) was published in a ""Clinical Practice"" article in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Although PubMed is frequently used by physicians in large hospitals, it does not return answers to specific questions. Frequently, PubMed returns a large number of articles in response to a specific user query. Physicians have limited time for browsing the articles retrieved; it has been found that physicians spend on average two minutes or less seeking an answer to a question, and that if a search takes longer it is likely to be abandoned. An evaluation study has shown that it takes an average of more than 30 minutes for a healthcare provider to search for answer from PubMed, which makes ""information seeking ... practical only `after hours' and not in the clinical setting."" It has been concluded that a lack of time is the most common obstacle resulting in many unanswered medical questions.       The importance of answering physicians' questions at the point of patient care has been widely recognized by the medical community. Many medical databases (e.g., UpToDate and Thomson MICROMEDEX) provide summaries to answer important medical questions related to patient care. However, most of the summaries are written by medical experts who manually review the literature information. The databases are limited in their scope and timeliness.       We hypothesize that we can develop medical language processing (MLP) approaches to build a fully automated system HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from literature to answer their ad-hoc medical quEstionS. HERMES will automatically retrieve, extract, analyze, and integrate text, image, and video from the literature and formulate them as answers to ad-hoc medical questions posed by physicians. Our preliminary results show that even a limited HERMES working system outperformed other information retrieval systems and can generate answers within a timeframe necessary to meet the demands of physicians. HERMES promise to assist physicians for practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM), the medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, i.e., high-quality patient-centered clinical research reported in the primary medical literature.       Our specific aims are:       1) Identify information needs from ad-hoc medical questions. We will incorporate rich semantic, statistical, and machine learning approaches to map ad-hoc medical questions to their component question types automatically. A component question type is a generic, simple question type that requires an answer strategy that is different from other component question types.       2) Develop new information retrieval models that integrate domain-specific knowledge for retrieving relevant documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       3) Extract relevant text, images, and videos from the retrieved documents in response to an ad-hoc medical question.       4) Integrate text, images, and videos, fusing information to generate a short and coherent multimedia summary.       5) Design a usability study to measure efficacy, accuracy and perceived ease of use of HERMES and to compare HERMES with other information systems.          n/a",HERMES - Help physicians to Extract and aRticulate Multimedia information from li,7380099,R01LM009836,"['Area', 'Back', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Edema', 'Erythema', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Multimedia', 'New England', 'Numbers', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'design', 'foot', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'mecarzole', 'older men', 'patient oriented', 'response', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2007,383550,-0.030544485507276606
"The BioSense Initiative to Improve Early Event Detection RTI International, in partnership with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), and in collaboration with the North Carolina Division of Public Health (NC-DPH), is submitting this application to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to improve early detection of disease outbreaks of public health significance. Rapid detection of disease outbreaks rests on a foundation of accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. The overarching objective of this research is to define, evaluate, and standardize a methodology for creating useful case definitions designed for the early detection of intentional and naturally occurring disease outbreaks. The specific aim of this research proposal is to develop and test methods for increasing the sensitivity and specificity of syndrome definitions using timely emergency department data. Improved case definitions will enhance CDC's capacity to detect and investigate threats to the health of the population, which CDC undertakes as part of its mission. Emergency department data may serve as a rich source for early signals of health threats to the population, but case definitions have not been standardized, and new methods are needed to process and use the textual information found within the emergency record. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative and iterative research plan that leverages RTI's and UNC-CH's capabilities to best serveCDC and the public health community. We will use emergency department data captured through North Carolina's Bioterrorism and Emerging Infections PreventiveService, the operational syndromic surveillance system used by NC-DPH to monitor the state. After (1) developing a gold standard data set of ED visits for evaluating syndrometest characteristics, we will (2) evaluate natural language processing for preprocessing chief complaints; (3) explore use of semantic networking tools for developing definitions; (4) apply a reverse engineering process using ICD-9-CMcode groupings; and (5) assess the applicability of early event detection for creating situational awareness following detection of an event. These methods will make use of information within the emergency record and create syndrome definitions with acceptable sensitivity, specificity, and positisve predictive value. Valid syndromedefinitions will enable public health officials to operate a national monitoring system that can automatically detect signals that may represent disease outbreaks or other potential threats to health. Operation of this system will protect the public health and will strengthen the capacity of public health officials to investigate and respond to these threats rapidly. n/a",The BioSense Initiative to Improve Early Event Detection,7428896,R01PH000038,[' '],PHPPO,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2007,415565,-0.0017668568287820445
"Automatic Detection of Critical Dermoscopy Features for Melanoma Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malignant melanoma, with an estimated growth in incidence of about 6% per year for decades, causes considerable loss of life. Yet melanoma can be easily cured if detected early. Digital dermoscopy has shown promise for more accurate detection, particularly at an early stage. Recent conferences have highlighted a general agreement on definition of dermoscopic features and moderate agreement on the most useful structural features. Automatic detection of these specific structures that are critical for early diagnosis and are used in various dermoscopic diagnostic algorithms would be desirable. Yet little work has been published on automatic detection of any specific dermoscopic structures. Although specific colors figure prominently in the definition of the most critical dermoscopic structures, little work has been done on finding the specific regions or region combinations in the color space where colors are located, particularly with reference to the surrounding skin. The work in Phase I and after Phase I successfully segmented the border within 5% of the range of the dermatologists' borders, found several highly accurate dermoscopy features, and brought mean diagnostic accuracy on difficult early lesions to a high level. This proposal seeks to develop a digital dermosocopy system by 1) comparing classifiers 2) testing border accuracy and modifying segmentation if needed 3) developing an algorithm that uses a three-dimensional representation of a probability density function to specify single and paired melanoma colors via cluster methods and fuzzy logic techniques 4) identifying critical structural features including brown globules, abrupt border cutoff, granularity, regression, and pigment asymmetry with high accuracy 5) developing a clinical interface for acquisition of images within the clinic 6) testing the new algorithms in six dermatology clinics including two pigmented lesion clinics with both EpiLight and DermLite II Pro dermoscopy images taken in the clinic. Key features of the research include dermatopathology confirmation of specific structures and the use of relative color analysis. If successful, software will be marketed to the growing number of dermatologists with digital dermoscopy capability. The commercial software package will be ready for marketing as a diagnostic adjunct for digital camera dermoscopy attachments. Malignant melanoma, with an estimated growth in incidence of about 6% per year for decades, causes considerable loss of life. Melanoma can be easily cured if detected early, and this project seeks to develop a digital dermoscopy device that can detect very early melanomas. The project goal is to develop inexpensive melanoma detection software and test it in multiple dermatology clinics.          n/a",Automatic Detection of Critical Dermoscopy Features for Melanoma Diagnosis,7284886,R44CA101639,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Am 80', 'Amelanotic Melanoma', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Borderline Lesion', 'Boxing', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Cicatrix', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Count', 'Decision Trees', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermatology', 'Dermoscopy', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease regression', 'Dysplastic Nevus', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Hair', 'Hair Removal', 'Head', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Lentigo', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'N(delta)-acetylornithine, -isomer', 'N-dodecanoylglutamic acid, -isomer, sodium salt', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Physicians', 'Pigments', 'Precancerous melanosis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'ROC Curve', 'Radial', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Score', 'Series', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Work', 'alpha-difluoromethyl-DOPA, -isomer', 'alpha-methylornithine dihydrochloride, -isomer', 'base', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'melanoma', 'reconstruction', 'software development', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool development', 'vector']",NCI,STOECKER & ASSOCIATES,R44,2007,494442,-0.04493871932725642
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,7249382,R01EB000362,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Computer Architectures', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Geographic Locations', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Information Management', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Link', 'Management Information Systems', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Metric', 'Multimedia', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Series', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'United States', 'Urology', 'Visit', 'base', 'concept', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'peer', 'point of care', 'portability', 'research clinical testing', 'urologic', 'usability']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2007,517331,0.014478010774818572
"Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Microbial threats, including bioterrorism and naturally emerging infectious diseases, pose a serious challenge to national security in the United States and to health worldwide.  This proposal describes the creation of a center for computational modeling of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with the collaboration of key experts at the Brookings Institution, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the University of Maryland, and Imperial College (London).  The overarching aim of this project is to integrate the most advanced and powerful techniques of epidemiological data analysis with those of computer simulation (agent-based modeling) to produce a unified computational epidemiology that is scientifically sound, highly visual and user-friendly, and responsive to biosecurity and public health policy requirements.  Data analysis will be guided by the insight that epidemic patterns over space and time can be approached as nearly decomposable systems, in which frequency components of the incidence signal can be isolated and studied.  Wavelet transforms, and empiric mode decomposition using Hilbert-Huang Transforms, will be used to sift nonlinear, nonstationary epidemiological data, allowing frequency band patterns to be defined.  Isolated frequency modes will then be associated with external forcing (weather, social contact patterns) and internal dynamics (Kermack-McKendrick predator-prey models).  Results of the epidemiological data decomposition analysis, along with the knowledge of infectious disease experts, will instruct the creation and development of agent-based models.  Such models feature populations of mobile individuals in artificial societies that interact locally with other individuals.  Features of the basic model include variable social network structures, individual susceptibility and immunity, incubation periods, transmission rates, contact rates, and other selectable parameters.  After the agent-based model is calibrated to generate epidemic patterns consistent with real world epidemiology, preventive strategies including vaccination, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other public health measures will be systematically introduced and their impact evaluated.  Methods will be developed for assessing the utility of individual models, and for making decisions based on combined results from more than one model.  Infectious diseases to be studied initially include smallpox, SARS, dengue, West Nile, and unknown but hypothetically plausible agents.  As part of a Cooperative Agreement, the Center will work with other research groups, a bioinformatics core group, and the NIGMS to develop data sets, software and methods, agent-based models, and visualization tools.  In an infectious disease epidemic emergency the Center will redirect its activities to serve the nation's security, as guided by the NIGMS. n/a",Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats,7284239,U01GM070708,"['AIDS therapy', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Academy', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Airborne Particulate Matter', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Americas', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Appendix', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arthropod Vectors', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioterrorism', 'Books', 'Borrelia', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Contact Tracing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Demography', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Earthquakes', 'Ecology', 'Economics', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ehrlichia', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Encephalitis', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering technology', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Foot-and-Mouth Disease', 'Frequencies', 'Game Theory', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Hantavirus', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis E', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hygiene', 'Imagery', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Informatics', 'Information Services', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Leptospira', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'London', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malaria', 'Maryland', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mathematical Biology', 'Mathematics', 'Measles', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Modified Smallpox', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'National Security', 'New York', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Observational Study', 'Oceanography', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Physical Dialysis', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prion Diseases', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Public Policy', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Quarantine', 'Rate', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reference Standards', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rickettsia', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Schedule', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Security', 'Series', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Smallpox', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Space Flight', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Tropical Medicine', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Violence', 'Viral', 'Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Weather', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'base', 'biosecurity', 'c new', 'college', 'computer science', 'concept', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'editorial', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infectious disease model', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'microbial', 'models and simulation', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'peer', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'remote sensing', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social organization', 'sound', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly', 'vaccination strategy']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2007,588968,0.007852872895367163
"Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research program is to develop computer software tools with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform instantaneous, automated analysis and clinical interpretation of wavefront error measurements of the human eye and cornea. Secondary goals are to improve the overall design of oculometric data visualization tools, provide information that will help to establish clinical and scientific standards for ocular measurements and procedures, and improve our understanding of the fundamental relationship between optical performance and visual performance. We hypothesize that a) AI-based algorithms will detect complex patterns of wavefront errors; b) these patterns are specific to and significantly correlated with certain diseases and disorders; and c) AI-based interpretation of complex data will be superior to that performed by expert humans, who are the gold standard for interpreting clinical data. Specifically, we will (1) develop, train, and test AI-based algorithms (Bayesian and neural networks) to interpret the significance of complex wavefront error data obtained retrospectively from examination records of patients with various ocular diseases, disorders, or surgical interventions, as well as normal eyes; (2) simulate wavefront error data using computer models based on statistical distributions of actual ocular aberrations from patient population samples for the purpose of investigating the importance of individual higher order aberrations to retinal image formation and potential visual performance, as well as to generate new data that will enhance the overall AI training and testing process, and (3) establish standard methods to acquire and analyze wavefront error data. AI-based tools will assist vision scientists to efficiently develop study databases and analyze aberration data. Clinicians will diagnose patients faster, more accurately, and with a greater degree of confidence. For patients, refractive surgery outcomes will be more predictable, and they will benefit from earlier detection of diseases such as cataracts and corneal ectasias.         n/a",Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data,7287568,R01EY014162,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'eye refractometry', 'human data', 'image processing', 'ophthalmoscopy']",NEI,LOUISIANA STATE UNIV HSC NEW ORLEANS,R01,2006,38558,-0.011173839430474385
"Longitudinal Psychometric Investigation of the WISDM Tobacco Dependence Measure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Description: The construct of nicotine dependence (ND) is assumed to underlie tobacco addiction but there is a notable lack of consensus about the nature and optimal measurement of ND. In applied research, ND is often assumed to be a dimensional, trait-like condition with varying degrees of severity although some studies use categorical or discrete diagnostic conceptualizations of ND as found in the DSM-IV diagnosis of Nicotine Dependence. There is increasing evidence that ND is multidimensional. Only recently have psychometrically sound, theoretically-based, multidimensional measures of ND been developed, such as the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM). The WISDM measures thirteen smoking dependence motives that are hypothesized to influence dependence processes such as inability to quit, nicotine withdrawal, and relapse. The WISDM subscales reflect a variety of theory-based internal factors (e.g., tolerance) and external factors (e.g., social and environmental goads to smoke) that permit investigation of different smoking motives in clinical and experimental contexts. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the nature of ND by assessing measurement and structural invariance across gender and racial/ethnic groups and time as well as investigating the predictive, concurrent, convergent, and discriminant validity of WISDM subscales. This will be accomplished by conducting a series of secondary analyses on datasets from two observational studies and two smoking cessation clinical trials that administered the WISDM to culturally diverse smokers (White, African American, and Hispanic). Latent variable (e.g., multigroup confirmatory factor analyses) and other models will test for invariance of key model parameters (e.g., factor covariances) across gender and racial/ethnic groups as a means of evaluating similarity of multidimensional models across the groups. Validity analyses will include multivariate linear and logistic regression models as well as latent variable modeling that will allow complex tests of individual WISDM dimensions or sets of dimensions in relation to smoking and relapse.

"Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of obesity in developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers and is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this research is to investigate application of novel noninvasive devices and pattern recognition methods to perform studies of human food intake behavior and produce objective estimates of volumetric and caloric food intake that will be relevant for identifying effective measures to treat or prevent diseases like obesity. Such devices and methods could extend our understanding of causes of obesity, and the monitoring devices created in this study could be used for monitoring of obese patients and as a part of a therapy potentially improve quality of life and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity. The goal of this study is to design and perform a pilot investigation which will provide preliminary data that objective observations of mastication (chewing) and deglutition (swallowing) by a wearable, non-intrusive monitoring device can provide statistically reliable estimates of eating habits by providing objective measures of delution frequency, duration of mastication and identifying periods of food intake with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.  The aims of the proposed research include design of the wearable sensors and associated signal processing methods; development of pattern recognition methodologies that will automatically detect instances of delution and mastication from sensor recordings; development of pattern recognition methods to automatically identify periods of food intake based on detected chewing and swallowing; and to validate these device and methodologies on a group of human subjects. Modern methods of computational intelligence such as artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic will be used along with statistical methods to achieve the highest 'accuracy of pattern recognition. n/a",Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake,7140644,R21HL083052,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior test', 'bioenergetics', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical automation', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biosensor device', 'biotechnology', 'caloric dietary content', 'calorimetry', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'human morbidity', 'human subject', 'mastication', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nutrient intake activity', 'nutrition related tag', 'obesity', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'quality of life', 'statistics /biometry', 'swallowing']",NHLBI,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R21,2006,182119,0.004206433518338335

"Least Angle Regression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SBIR project aims to produce superior methods and software for classification and regression when there are many potential predictor variables to choose from. The methods should (1) produce stable results, where small changes in the data do not produce major changes in the variables selected or in model predictions; (2) produce accurate predictions; (3) facilitate scientific interpretation, by selecting a smaller subset of predictors which provide the best predictions; (4) allow continuous and categorical variables; and (5) support linear regression, logistic regression (predicting a binary outcome), survival analysis, and other types of regression. This project is based on least angle regression, which unifies and provides a fast implementation for a number of modern regression techniques. Least angle regression has great potential, but currently available software is limited in scope and robustness. The outcome of this project should be software which is more robust and widely applicable. This software would apply broadly, including to medical diagnosis, detecting cancer, feature selection in microarrays, and modeling patient characteristics like blood pressure. Phase I work demonstrates feasibility by extending least angle work in three key directions-categorical predictors, logistic regression, and a numerically-accurate implementation. Phase II goals include extensions to other types of explanatory variables (e.g. polynomial or spline functions, and interactions between variables), to survival and other additional regression models, and to handle missing data and massive data sets. This proposed software will enable medical researchers to obtain high prediction accuracy, and obtain stable and interpretable results, in high-dimensional situations. Predicting outcomes based on covariates, determining which covariates most affect outcomes, and adjusting treatment effects estimates for covariates, are among the most important problems in biostatistics. Prediction and feature selection are particularly difficult when there are more possible features than samples; gene microarrays and protein mass spectrometry are extreme examples of this, producing thousands to millions of measurements per sample. LARS excels at feature selection; the proposed software should enable medical researchers to obtain stable and interpretable models with better prediction accuracy in high-dimensional situations.             n/a",Least Angle Regression,7219604,R44GM074313,"['computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'data management', 'handbook', 'mathematical model', 'mathematics', 'method development', 'microarray technology', 'model design /development', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,INSIGHTFUL CORPORATION,R44,2006,374846,-0.00534020139299726
"LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The high cost ($0.8 - $1.7 billion) and long time frames (about 13 years) required to introduce new drugs to the market contributes substantially to spiraling health care costs and diseases persisting without effective cures. A major factor is the high attrition rate of new compounds failing due to toxicity identified years into clinical trials. This particular circumstance cost the pharmaceutical industry approximately $8 billion in 2003. In silico tools generally offer the promise of identifying toxicity issues much more rapidly than clinical methods, however, they are not sufficiently accurate for pharmaceutical companies to confidently make definitive early screening and related investment decisions. LiverTox is a highly advanced, self-learning liver toxicity prediction tool that represents a quantum leap over current in silico methods. It offers a highly innovative use of multiple analytical approaches to accurately predict the toxicity of candidate Pharmaceuticals in the liver. A differentiating capability is its self-learning computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets. They rapidly assimilate massive volumes of information from LiverTox's extensive, dynamic, and thoroughly reviewed databases. Initially, LiverTox will generate predictions derived from five independent CNN-based submodules; one trained in advanced computational chemistry methods to make quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses; a second trained with microarray data; a third trained with Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing and Gene Expression (MPSS/GE) data; and fourth and fifth submodules trained with proteomics and metabolomics/metabonomics data, respectively. Challenging LiverTox with new chemical formulations triggers the five independent submodules to each make toxicity endpoint predictions drawing upon its knowledge base and its similarity analysis/fuzzy logic/statistical training. This tool's flexible, highly advanced system architecture and advanced learning capabilities using data obtained from diverse techniques enable it to rapidly digest new data, build upon new data acquisition techniques, and use prior lessons learned to achieve overall toxicity predictions with greater than 95% accuracy. LiverTox's ability to rapidly and accurately predict the toxicity of drug candidates will allow pharmaceutical companies to move from discovery to curing disease faster, at greatly reduced cost, and with less reliance on animal-based tests.         n/a",LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction,7125135,R42ES013321,"['artificial intelligence', 'chemical structure function', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'drug discovery /isolation', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'hepatotoxin', 'microarray technology', 'toxicant screening']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R42,2006,387181,-0.01820761404302385
"Trainable Early Warning System for Epileptic Seizures DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Individuals with epilepsy, their families and the professionals that treat them have long felt the need for reliable warning of an impending epileptic seizure. In Phase I, we developed a unique, multi-parameter, individualized, trainable seizure predetection system which extracts spectral, wavelet and time domain features and uses recurrent neural networks to analyze many hours of multichannel EEG and predetect seizure onsets with a high level of accuracy and reliability. The underlying analytical software for this system was tested on large database of scalp EEG recordings from five epilepsy centers and contained over 373 hours of recordings from 17 patients containing 50 seizures. This is a large database compared to those reported by most investigators in this field. Phase I results were very accurate and reliable (sensitivity: 100%, false positive rate 0.02/hr and detection times that occurred an average of 9.1 seconds, before seizure onset). This is entirely acceptable for our primary target application, of warning of a seizure onset to enable timely diagnostic injection to locate the brain region where the seizure starts using SPECT imaging. In Phase II we will refine the detection process, validate performance in a large data set, implement the software in C++ modules, and test the commercial prototype in a clinical setting. These steps will result in a company supported Phase III product development, integration into existing EEG recording systems, beta testing and commercialization. While Phase 2 will concentrate on the SPECT application using scalp electrodes, the scalp EEG techniques developed will be applicable without change for general use in an epilepsy monitoring facility to alert staff of impending seizures and allow them to attend to patient safety in a timely manner. Predetection will also facilitate neuropsychological or other testing in the epilepsy monitoring environment. With additional work, the techniques developed can be applied to ambulatory devices for seizure alert, or for episodic vagal nerve stimulation to block seizures. n/a",Trainable Early Warning System for Epileptic Seizures,7109311,R44NS039214,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain disorder diagnosis', 'brain electrical activity', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'brain mapping', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'early diagnosis', 'electroencephalography', 'epilepsy', 'human subject', 'neuropsychology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient monitoring device', 'radiotracer', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NINDS,"CHATTEN ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2006,400929,-0.004647984159445695
"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,7110256,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'health science research', 'human data', 'informatics', 'library', 'medical records', 'molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,478733,-0.008545226534521728
"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,7083613,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information display', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'outcomes research', 'patient care management', 'performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2006,535569,0.014478010774818572

"Multi-microphone long probe for OAE acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of an innovative multi-microphone probe and acquisition system for recording otoacoustic emissions {OAEs} with advanced noise cancellation algorithms, increased frequency and intensity ranges and pressurization capabilities is proposed. Two advanced noise cancellation algorithm will be implemented: 1) a multi-reference adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) network and 2) two-dimensional filtering. These algorithms will utilize the independent measurements provided by the multiple microphones in order to reduce noise contaminants. Each microphone or microphone groupings will be connected to individual analog-to-digital (A/D) converters in order to allow for the implementation of the digital signal processing algorithms. The pressurization capabilities of the probe will allow implementation of tympanometry and the acquisition of OAEs while compensating for pressure imbalances between the outer and middle ear. Results from a prototype single microphone long probe are presented demonstrating that the design concept is valid and provides good quality OAE recordings while reducing the undesirable effects of the metal response. The proposed probe will also improve upon the limited dynamic and frequency range of current OAE probes. The probe is expected to be able to provide stimulus levels of up to 90 dB HL and a frequency response of up to 24 kHz. During Phase I, various probes will be constructed and tested under different noise conditions in adult and infant subjects.

"Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Inter-observer variability in mammogram reading has been well documented in the literature. Various factors have been used to explain this variability; among them, the most significant are related to the management of perceived findings.  However, the nature of this inter-observer variability has not been explored. Namely, were the lesions that were consistently reported by the radiologists any different from the ones that yield disagreement? Furthermore, could these differences be quantitatively assessed? Moreover, were these differences in any way related with the experience level of the observer? In addition, the interpretation of perceived findings is closely related with the visual search strategy used to scan the breast tissue, because observers compare perceived findings with the background, in order to determine their uniqueness. Hence, what is the effect of visual search strategy on inter-observer variability? Can this effect be modeled using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)? Can inferences be made regarding the observers' decision patterns by analyzing the results of simulations run on the ANNs?  The work described here aims at answering these questions. We will use spatial frequency analysis to characterize the areas on mammogram cases where mammographers, chest radiologists with experience reading mammograms and radiology residents at the end of their mammography rotation, indicate the presence of a finding, or fail to do so. We will assess inter-observer agreement, as well as intra- and inter-group agreement for the various groups of observers. In addition, we will train artificial neural networks to represent each observer, in such a way that by changing the nature of the features input to the ANNs we will be able to simulate how such changes would have affected the actual observer. We will assess the effects on inter-observer variability of changing the search strategy used by the observer to sample the breast tissue. In our setting, the inter-observer variability will be assessed by comparing the outputs of the ANNs that represent each observer. In addition, the changes in sampling strategy will correspond to actual possible strategies for the human observers themselves. n/a",Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography,6924688,R21CA100107,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'human data', 'human therapy evaluation', 'mammography', 'visual perception']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2005,167063,-0.042868446253526794

In silico tools generally offer the promise of identifying toxicity issues much more rapidly than clinical methods, however, they are not sufficiently accurate for pharmaceutical companies to confidently make definitive early screening and related investment decisions. LiverTox is a highly advanced, self-learning liver toxicity prediction tool that represents a quantum leap over current in silico methods. It offers a highly innovative use of multiple analytical approaches to accurately predict the toxicity of candidate Pharmaceuticals in the liver. A differentiating capability is its self-learning computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets. They rapidly assimilate massive volumes of information from LiverTox's extensive, dynamic, and thoroughly reviewed databases. Initially, LiverTox will generate predictions derived from five independent CNN-based submodules; one trained in advanced computational chemistry methods to make quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses; a second trained with microarray data; a third trained with Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing and Gene Expression (MPSS/GE) data; and fourth and fifth submodules trained with proteomics and metabolomics/metabonomics data, respectively. Challenging LiverTox with new chemical formulations triggers the five independent submodules to each make toxicity endpoint predictions drawing upon its knowledge base and its similarity analysis/fuzzy logic/statistical training. This tool's flexible, highly advanced system architecture and advanced learning capabilities using data obtained from diverse techniques enable it to rapidly digest new data, build upon new data acquisition techniques, and use prior lessons learned to achieve overall toxicity predictions with greater than 95% accuracy. LiverTox's ability to rapidly and accurately predict the toxicity of drug candidates will allow pharmaceutical companies to move from discovery to curing disease faster, at greatly reduced cost, and with less reliance on animal-based tests.         n/a",LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction,7052491,R42ES013321,"['artificial intelligence', 'chemical structure function', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'drug discovery /isolation', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'hepatotoxin', 'microarray technology', 'toxicant screening']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R42,2005,180862,-0.01820761404302385
"Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of obesity in developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers and is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this research is to investigate application of novel noninvasive devices and pattern recognition methods to perform studies of human food intake behavior and produce objective estimates of volumetric and caloric food intake that will be relevant for identifying effective measures to treat or prevent diseases like obesity. Such devices and methods could extend our understanding of causes of obesity, and the monitoring devices created in this study could be used for monitoring of obese patients and as a part of a therapy potentially improve quality of life and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity. The goal of this study is to design and perform a pilot investigation which will provide preliminary data that objective observations of mastication (chewing) and deglutition (swallowing) by a wearable, non-intrusive monitoring device can provide statistically reliable estimates of eating habits by providing objective measures of delution frequency, duration of mastication and identifying periods of food intake with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.  The aims of the proposed research include design of the wearable sensors and associated signal processing methods; development of pattern recognition methodologies that will automatically detect instances of delution and mastication from sensor recordings; development of pattern recognition methods to automatically identify periods of food intake based on detected chewing and swallowing; and to validate these device and methodologies on a group of human subjects. Modern methods of computational intelligence such as artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic will be used along with statistical methods to achieve the highest 'accuracy of pattern recognition. n/a",Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake,7022662,R21HL083052,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior test', 'bioenergetics', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical automation', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biosensor device', 'biotechnology', 'caloric dietary content', 'calorimetry', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'human morbidity', 'human subject', 'mastication', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nutrient intake activity', 'nutrition related tag', 'obesity', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'quality of life', 'statistics /biometry', 'swallowing']",NHLBI,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R21,2005,217756,0.004206433518338335
"Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research program is to develop computer software tools with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform instantaneous, automated analysis and clinical interpretation of wavefront error measurements of the human eye and cornea. Secondary goals are to improve the overall design of oculometric data visualization tools, provide information that will help to establish clinical and scientific standards for ocular measurements and procedures, and improve our understanding of the fundamental relationship between optical performance and visual performance. We hypothesize that a) AI-based algorithms will detect complex patterns of wavefront errors; b) these patterns are specific to and significantly correlated with certain diseases and disorders; and c) AI-based interpretation of complex data will be superior to that performed by expert humans, who are the gold standard for interpreting clinical data. Specifically, we will (1) develop, train, and test AI-based algorithms (Bayesian and neural networks) to interpret the significance of complex wavefront error data obtained retrospectively from examination records of patients with various ocular diseases, disorders, or surgical interventions, as well as normal eyes; (2) simulate wavefront error data using computer models based on statistical distributions of actual ocular aberrations from patient population samples for the purpose of investigating the importance of individual higher order aberrations to retinal image formation and potential visual performance, as well as to generate new data that will enhance the overall AI training and testing process, and (3) establish standard methods to acquire and analyze wavefront error data. AI-based tools will assist vision scientists to efficiently develop study databases and analyze aberration data. Clinicians will diagnose patients faster, more accurately, and with a greater degree of confidence. For patients, refractive surgery outcomes will be more predictable, and they will benefit from earlier detection of diseases such as cataracts and corneal ectasias.         n/a",Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data,6910621,R01EY014162,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'eye refractometry', 'human data', 'image processing', 'ophthalmoscopy']",NEI,LOUISIANA STATE UNIV HSC NEW ORLEANS,R01,2005,245768,-0.011173839430474385
"Trainable Early Warning System for Epileptic Seizures DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Individuals with epilepsy, their families and the professionals that treat them have long felt the need for reliable warning of an impending epileptic seizure. In Phase I, we developed a unique, multi-parameter, individualized, trainable seizure predetection system which extracts spectral, wavelet and time domain features and uses recurrent neural networks to analyze many hours of multichannel EEG and predetect seizure onsets with a high level of accuracy and reliability. The underlying analytical software for this system was tested on large database of scalp EEG recordings from five epilepsy centers and contained over 373 hours of recordings from 17 patients containing 50 seizures. This is a large database compared to those reported by most investigators in this field. Phase I results were very accurate and reliable (sensitivity: 100%, false positive rate 0.02/hr and detection times that occurred an average of 9.1 seconds, before seizure onset). This is entirely acceptable for our primary target application, of warning of a seizure onset to enable timely diagnostic injection to locate the brain region where the seizure starts using SPECT imaging. In Phase II we will refine the detection process, validate performance in a large data set, implement the software in C++ modules, and test the commercial prototype in a clinical setting. These steps will result in a company supported Phase III product development, integration into existing EEG recording systems, beta testing and commercialization. While Phase 2 will concentrate on the SPECT application using scalp electrodes, the scalp EEG techniques developed will be applicable without change for general use in an epilepsy monitoring facility to alert staff of impending seizures and allow them to attend to patient safety in a timely manner. Predetection will also facilitate neuropsychological or other testing in the epilepsy monitoring environment. With additional work, the techniques developed can be applied to ambulatory devices for seizure alert, or for episodic vagal nerve stimulation to block seizures. n/a",Trainable Early Warning System for Epileptic Seizures,6993754,R44NS039214,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain disorder diagnosis', 'brain electrical activity', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'brain mapping', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'early diagnosis', 'electroencephalography', 'epilepsy', 'human subject', 'neuropsychology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient monitoring device', 'radiotracer', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NINDS,"ASTRO-MED, INC.",R44,2005,306142,-0.004647984159445695
"The BioSense Initiative to Improve Early Event Detection RTI International, in partnership with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), and in collaboration with the North Carolina Division of Public Health (NC-DPH), is submitting this application to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to improve early detection of disease outbreaks of public health significance. Rapid detection of disease outbreaks rests on a foundation of accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. The overarching objective of this research is to define, evaluate, and standardize a methodology for creating useful case definitions designed for the early detection of intentional and naturally occurring disease outbreaks. The specific aim of this research proposal is to develop and test methods for increasing the sensitivity and specificity of syndrome definitions using timely emergency department data. Improved case definitions will enhance CDC's capacity to detect and investigate threats to the health of the population, which CDC undertakes as part of its mission. Emergency department data may serve as a rich source for early signals of health threats to the population, but case definitions have not been standardized, and new methods are needed to process and use the textual information found within the emergency record. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative and iterative research plan that leverages RTI's and UNC-CH's capabilities to best serve CDC and the public health community. We will use emergency department data captured through North Carolina's Bioterrorism and Emerging Infections Preventive Service, the operational syndromic surveillance system used by NC-DPH to monitor the state. After (1) developing a gold standard data set of ED visits for evaluating syndrome test characteristics, we will (2) evaluate natural language processing for preprocessing chief complaints; (3) explore use of semantic networking tools for developing definitions; (4) apply a reverse engineering process using ICD-9-CM code groupings; and (5) assess the applicability of early event detection for creating situational awareness following detection of an event. These methods will make use of information within the emergency record and create syndrome definitions with acceptable sensitivity, specificity, and positisve predictive value. Valid syndrome definitions will enable public health officials to operate a national monitoring system that can automatically detect signals that may represent disease outbreaks or other potential threats to health. Operation of this system will protect the public health and will strengthen the capacity of public health officials to investigate and respond to these threats rapidly.  n/a",The BioSense Initiative to Improve Early Event Detection,7097771,R01PH000038,"['artificial intelligence', 'biohazard detection', 'bioterrorism /chemical warfare', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'disease /disorder classification', 'disease outbreaks', 'early diagnosis', 'emergency health services', 'emerging infectious disease', 'environmental health', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'informatics', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'public health', 'rapid diagnosis', 'vocabulary development for information system']",PHPPO,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2005,412947,-0.001600114728288046
"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.  The availability of related compatible clinical and biomolecular NLP systems, provide an exceptional opportunity to pave the way for capture, integration and organization of phenotypic and genotypic data and knowledge that will be used to radically improve patient care. n/a",Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information,6912634,R01LM007659,"['cancer information system', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'health science research', 'human data', 'informatics', 'library', 'medical records', 'molecular biology information system']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2005,478937,-0.008545226534521728
"Biosurveillance/SNOMED-CT Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred. This presents an opportunity to capture and analyze signals from patient records. We propose to provide an abstraction of automated clinical information from the clinical record (section by section) that will be coded using SNOMED-CT which can serve as the substrate for surveillance data. We believe that this data (sets of codes by section of the clinical record) which holds the important and salient medical facts (codes) regarding the patients' presentation, findings, medications, allergies and co-morbidities could be abstracted from clinical records. In this study, we will analyze SNOMED-CT's ability to provide adequate content coverage for constellations of symptoms associated with exposures to agents of bioterrorism (i.e. Anthrax, Small Pox, Ricin, and Radiation exposure). Our method builds on the considerable body of research already available within our laboratory. We have been researching methods for codifying medical content using controlled medical vocabularies since 1987. For this study, we will employ the Mayo Vocabulary Server (MVS) developed in the Mayo Laboratory of Biomedical Informatics and has been used at Mayo, Johns Hopkins University and the VA medical centers all with great success. Our performanc2 of the MVS toolkit has been validated for diagnoses where we showed a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 97.9%.

"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,6917854,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information display', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'outcomes research', 'patient care management', 'performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2005,593264,0.014478010774818572
"Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     An emerging trend in computational linguistics is melding natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to help computers make sense of human-generated free text. The blending of these disciplines is relatively rare in biomedical informatics. Past medical NLP/ML research work is biased heavily towards linguistic methods that attempt to reason about grammar and syntax aided by a domain-focal knowledge base (e.g., one for radiology or one for clinical pathology). The aim of the work proposed here takes a different tack: exploring the utility of a statistical approach to clinical NLP, one augmented by machine learning and concentrating on general progress notes from across multiple clinical domains. The specific clinical goal will be to identify adverse drug events described implicitly or explicitly in inpatient progress notes. Rather than relying on a narrow domain focus to provide enough context restriction to make text interpretation tractable, this approach will use statistical patterns in note author information (e.g., profession, note type, treating ward) and patient information (e.g., admit diagnosis, procedures performed, temporal note relationships) for context restriction. The research component of this proposal is divided into two categories: three small-scale projects designed to rapidly hone new skills developed under the training component, and a large-scale project that assesses the feasibility of cross-discipline clinical text analysis. n/a",Statistical NLP Analysis of Cross-discipline Clinical Text,6836781,F38LM008478,"['bioinformatics', 'clinical research', 'computational biology', 'human data', 'library', 'mathematical model', 'public health', 'statistics /biometry']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F38,2004,94545,0.013354729046324718
"Tree Ensemble Regression and Classification Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This SBIR aims to produce next generation classification and regression software based upon ensembles of decision trees: bagging, random forests, and boosting. The prediction accuracy of these methods has caused much excitement in the machine learning community, and both challenges and complements the data modeling culture prevalent among biostatisticians. Recent research extends the methodology to likelihood based methods used in biostatistics, leading to models for survival data and generalized forest models. Generalized forest models extend regression forests in the same way that generalized linear models extend linear models.      This software would apply broadly, including to medical diagnosis, prognostic modeling, and detecting cancer; and for modeling patient characteristics like blood pressure, discrete responses in clinical trials, and count data.      Phase I work will prototype software for survival data, and investigate the performance of ensemble methods on simulated and real data. For survival applications, we will assess out-of-bag estimates of performance, and investigate measures of variable importance and graphics that help clinicians understand the results. Experience writing prototypes and using them on data will lead to a preliminary software design that serves as the foundation of Phase II work.      Phase II will expand upon this work to create commercial software. We will research and implement algorithms for a wider range of applications including generalized forest models, classification, and least squares regression. We will also implement robust loss criteria that enable good performance on noisy data, and make adaptations to handle large data sets.      This proposed software will enable medical researchers to obtain high prediction accuracy, and complement traditional tools like discriminant analysis, linear and logistic regression models, and the Cox model.         n/a",Tree Ensemble Regression and Classification Methods,6832086,R43CA105724,"['clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer graphics /printing', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'human data', 'mathematical model', 'method development', 'model design /development', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'neoplasm /cancer remission /regression', 'prognosis', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,INSIGHTFUL CORPORATION,R43,2004,99937,0.0007772394232786971
"Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This training grant is designed to advance the academic career of Dr. Indu Ayappa by building on the applicant?s strong biomedical engineering and computer background and providing comprehensive multi-disciplinary training which will allow her to become an independent investigator. The applicant?s career goals are to enter full time academic research in sleep physiology. Training activities proposed will include academic course work designed to support the research program and expose her to aspects of clinical research in sleep, neural science and artificial intelligence techniques. She will be mentored by David Rapoport, M.D., Joyce Walsleben, Ph.D., and Maurice Ohayon, M.D., Ph.D., as well as faculty in computer science and neurophysiology. The aims of the planned research are to develop an artificial intelligence system for the identification and quantification of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) based solely on non-invasive cardiopulmonary signals collected during routine polysomnography. This will simplify, standardize and improve the diagnosis of SDB and facilitate research in this area. With the long term goal of physiologic characterization of the spectrum of SDB in order to clinically diagnose upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), the aims of this project are to: 1. Extract features from the nasal cannula airflow signal to characterize the state of resistance/collapsibility of individual breaths. These include amplitude, inspiratory flow contour, Ti/Ttot and presence of vibration which will be used as inputs to a neural network that will be trained and evaluated against breaths that have been classified by reference measurement of upper airway resistance (pressure/flow). 2A. Incorporate information from this classification of individual breaths to detect and classify respiratory events based on the flow signal alone using a trained neural network. 2B. Evaluate the utility of including additional cardiopulmonary signals like oxygen saturation, heart rate, pulse transit time and rib/abdominal movements (amplitude and phase) in the detection and classification of these events.

"Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Inter-observer variability in mammogram reading has been well documented in the literature. Various factors have been used to explain this variability; among them, the most significant are related to the management of perceived findings.  However, the nature of this inter-observer variability has not been explored. Namely, were the lesions that were consistently reported by the radiologists any different from the ones that yield disagreement? Furthermore, could these differences be quantitatively assessed? Moreover, were these differences in any way related with the experience level of the observer? In addition, the interpretation of perceived findings is closely related with the visual search strategy used to scan the breast tissue, because observers compare perceived findings with the background, in order to determine their uniqueness. Hence, what is the effect of visual search strategy on inter-observer variability? Can this effect be modeled using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)? Can inferences be made regarding the observers' decision patterns by analyzing the results of simulations run on the ANNs?  The work described here aims at answering these questions. We will use spatial frequency analysis to characterize the areas on mammogram cases where mammographers, chest radiologists with experience reading mammograms and radiology residents at the end of their mammography rotation, indicate the presence of a finding, or fail to do so. We will assess inter-observer agreement, as well as intra- and inter-group agreement for the various groups of observers. In addition, we will train artificial neural networks to represent each observer, in such a way that by changing the nature of the features input to the ANNs we will be able to simulate how such changes would have affected the actual observer. We will assess the effects on inter-observer variability of changing the search strategy used by the observer to sample the breast tissue. In our setting, the inter-observer variability will be assessed by comparing the outputs of the ANNs that represent each observer. In addition, the changes in sampling strategy will correspond to actual possible strategies for the human observers themselves. n/a",Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography,6821032,R21CA100107,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'human data', 'human therapy evaluation', 'mammography', 'visual perception']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2004,153968,-0.042868446253526794

"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures.

"Use of Microarray Test Data for Toxicogenomic Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This project bridges the understanding between physical and chemical principles and genomic/proteomic response by integrating three independent parallel toxicity prediction tools. Each uses computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets to rapidly and accurately make pharmaceutical/chemical toxicity predictions. A CNN-based Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) module makes toxicological predictions based only on structure-activity analyses; a second CNN/wavelet module makes independent toxicogenomic predictions using microarray data; and a third CNN/wavelet module makes toxicogenomic predictions using Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) data. This multi-intelligent, three-module approach provides crosschecks to reduce false positives and false negatives while substantially increasing confidence in predictions relative to current computer-based toxicity prediction techniques. The resulting product could potentially become a primary tool used by (a) human health researchers, b) pharmaceutical companies for screening drugs early during development, c) companies designing/developing new chemicals and chemically treated materials, and (d) government organizations (e.g., military) for mission-related chemical deployments. Public benefits include reduced health and environmental risks (e.g., 4 out of 5 chemicals in use today have inadequate testing); reduced reliance on animal testing; and reduced time and cost required to bring new pharmaceuticals and chemicals into beneficial medical and commercial use.            n/a",Use of Microarray Test Data for Toxicogenomic Prediction,6743871,R41ES013321,"['computational neuroscience', 'computer data analysis', 'evaluation /testing', 'method development', 'microarray technology', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'toxicant screening', 'toxicology']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R41,2004,211770,-0.024302137828082968
"Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research program is to develop computer software tools with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform instantaneous, automated analysis and clinical interpretation of wavefront error measurements of the human eye and cornea. Secondary goals are to improve the overall design of oculometric data visualization tools, provide information that will help to establish clinical and scientific standards for ocular measurements and procedures, and improve our understanding of the fundamental relationship between optical performance and visual performance. We hypothesize that a) AI-based algorithms will detect complex patterns of wavefront errors; b) these patterns are specific to and significantly correlated with certain diseases and disorders; and c) AI-based interpretation of complex data will be superior to that performed by expert humans, who are the gold standard for interpreting clinical data. Specifically, we will (1) develop, train, and test AI-based algorithms (Bayesian and neural networks) to interpret the significance of complex wavefront error data obtained retrospectively from examination records of patients with various ocular diseases, disorders, or surgical interventions, as well as normal eyes; (2) simulate wavefront error data using computer models based on statistical distributions of actual ocular aberrations from patient population samples for the purpose of investigating the importance of individual higher order aberrations to retinal image formation and potential visual performance, as well as to generate new data that will enhance the overall AI training and testing process, and (3) establish standard methods to acquire and analyze wavefront error data. AI-based tools will assist vision scientists to efficiently develop study databases and analyze aberration data.

"Development of Ultrasonic Appratus for Dental Diagnosis DESCRIPTION: An ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus has been proposed for Dental applications in determining tooth pathologies such as demineralization/caries, hidden fractures, and formation of abscesses. The equipment adopts a piezoelectric and laser optic hybrid transduction system for interrogation of teeth. Ultrasonic responses of the tooth structure will be analyzed by a pattern recognition expert system (artificial intelligence) to determine the diagnosis of the tooth inspected. The proposed research will eventually help to reduce the use of harmful X-ray radiation in Dental clinics and contribute to artificial intelligence based diagnosis. The proposed concept has been successfully demonstrated in the previous Phase I study. In this Phase II study, instrumentation for clinical data collection using a combination of conventional piezoelectric and new laser-based ultrasonic technologies will be developed and optimized; an artificial intelligence based diagnostic function will be developed using clinical data and implemented using embedded computing; numerical simulations will be used to enhance diagnostic function development; and finally, initial clinical trials will be conducted to demonstrate the performance of the prototype equipment.

"Capturing and linking genomic and clinical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to use natural language processing (NLP) to build a high throughput tool for facilitating cancer research by automatically extracting and organizing clinical and genetic information from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and from journal articles.  Our research involves advanced NLP techniques to:  1) enable the mining of phenotypic and genotypic data in the EMR; 2) automatically amass knowledge concerned with cancer and biomolecular relationships from journals; 3) develop a WEB-enabled visualization tool for researchers that will present diverse views of the knowledge; and 4) develop an Infrastructure that will link to the clinical data warehouse at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and to GeneWays, a related project that allows researchers to visualize pathways.   More specifically, MedLEE (the NLP system we developed that extracts and encodes clinical and environmental information from the EMR) will be extended to extract genetic information contained in the EMR; subsequently, twelve years of patient reports will be processed and the extracted data added to the warehouse.  In addition, a new system, PhenoGenes, will be developed based on MedLEE and GeneWays (which contains another NLP system we developed that extracts and codifies biomolecular relations from journal articles).  PhenoGenes will capture biomolecular interactions directly associated with the treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer.  It will also generate an XML knowledge base that will integrate and organize the information that will be captured, and a Web-enabled tool that will allow users to browse and view the knowledge clustered according to different orientations (e.g. gene, disease, tissue, interaction, etc.).  The knowledge base will be linked to the GeneWays system, so that relevant pathways can be visualized.   MedLEE is utilized operationally at NYPH.  It also has been demonstrated that both NLP systems are highly effective.  This current project builds upon our experience and success with these systems.

"Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Technological advances in medicine, particularly imaging, have resulted in early detection, objective documentation, and overall better insight into medical conditions. These advances, however, have also led to an increasingly complex medical record. Physicians now spend a significant portion of their time retrieving, structuring, organizing, and analyzing patient data, inaccurately and inefficiently: current information management systems in clinical medicine do not adequately support these functions, critical to the real-world practice of evidence-based medicine. Objective evidence, tailored to an individual patient, must be readily available to physicians as part of routine practice if true evidence-based medical practice is to become a reality. This proposal details the development and evaluation of several innovative technologies, providing solutions for the information management problems faced by physicians: 1) a distributed XML-based peer-to-peer medical record architecture, to enable portability and accessibility of patient information, regardless of geographical location; 2) a natural language processing (NLP) system for free-text medical reports, to automatically structure and characterize the contents of medical documents; 3) a phenomenon-centric data model, which supports the problem-solving tasks of the physician through explicit linking of objective findings (e.g., images, lab values) to medical problems; and 4) a time-based, problem-centric, context-sensitive visualization of the medical record, supporting a ""gestalt"" view of the patient, with access to detailed patient data when needed. Together, these technologies will form a comprehensive system facilitating evidence-based medicine in a real-world environment. System evaluation will proceed in two parts. Technical evaluation focuses on each of the proposed technologies individually, gauging classical performance metrics: scalability of the distributed medical record; NLP precision/recall; expressibility/comprehensibility of the data model; and the usability of the new medical record user interface. Clinical evaluation will follow a time series study design (""off-on-off""), with implementation of the entire system in a real-world clinical environment, the UCLA Clark Urological Center. Clinical evaluation will measure the effectiveness of the system as a whole on intermediate outcomes (process of care) including the number of visits, number of procedures performed, and time to final diagnosis (disposition), as well as the impact on physician efficiency (time required to gather information and review charts). n/a",Engineering Approach to Individually Tailored Medicine,6749459,R01EB000362,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information display', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'outcomes research', 'patient care management', 'performance']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2004,594553,0.014478010774818572
"A Cardiac Screening Device DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The broad, long-term objectives and aims of this project are to provide a reliable and easily-used device for qualified health care professionals to screen for and detect heart murmurs produced from congenital and acquired cardiac defects in children and adults. The device will be designed to distinguish between innocent and pathological heart murmurs with a high degree of accuracy.    The applicant organization, Cardiac Screening Partners, is a joint venture between Cardiac Access, Denver, Colorado and Cardionics, Inc., Webster, Texas. Cardiac Access is comprised of physicians and scientists with a past record of research in cardiac screening (specifically in heart murmurs) and artificial neural networks.

"Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This training grant is designed to advance the academic career of Dr. Indu Ayappa by building on the applicant?s strong biomedical engineering and computer background and providing comprehensive multi-disciplinary training which will allow her to become an independent investigator. The applicant?s career goals are to enter full time academic research in sleep physiology. Training activities proposed will include academic course work designed to support the research program and expose her to aspects of clinical research in sleep, neural science and artificial intelligence techniques. She will be mentored by David Rapoport, M.D., Joyce Walsleben, Ph.D., and Maurice Ohayon, M.D., Ph.D., as well as faculty in computer science and neurophysiology. The aims of the planned research are to develop an artificial intelligence system for the identification and quantification of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) based solely on non-invasive cardiopulmonary signals collected during routine polysomnography. This will simplify, standardize and improve the diagnosis of SDB and facilitate research in this area. With the long term goal of physiologic characterization of the spectrum of SDB in order to clinically diagnose upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), the aims of this project are to: 1. Extract features from the nasal cannula airflow signal to characterize the state of resistance/collapsibility of individual breaths. These include amplitude, inspiratory flow contour, Ti/Ttot and presence of vibration which will be used as inputs to a neural network that will be trained and evaluated against breaths that have been classified by reference measurement of upper airway resistance (pressure/flow). 2A. Incorporate information from this classification of individual breaths to detect and classify respiratory events based on the flow signal alone using a trained neural network. 2B. Evaluate the utility of including additional cardiopulmonary signals like oxygen saturation, heart rate, pulse transit time and rib/abdominal movements (amplitude and phase) in the detection and classification of these events. Successful completion of the training and research program will allow Dr. Ayappa to contribute independently to research in the field of sleep physiology. n/a",Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing,6638164,K25HL004420,"['artificial intelligence', ' automated data processing', ' breath tests', ' cardiopulmonary disease', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' disease /disorder classification', ' electrocardiography', ' electroencephalography', ' electromyography', ' electrooculography', ' human subject', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' patient oriented research', ' polysomnography', ' respiratory airflow disorder', ' respiratory airflow measurement', ' respiratory disorder diagnosis', ' sleep disorders']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K25,2003,147690,0.012899212896906735
"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6633609,R33CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R33,2003,618638,0.005805624760187825
"Diagnostic Logic and Adaptive Assessment for Psychiatry  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This SBIR Phase I application proposes to extend an existing multi-tier Internet client-server system (""CliniMetricar"") by integrating active diagnostic logic.  CliniMetrica currently provides systematic psychiatric assessment using the World Health Organization (WHO) Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, version 2.1). CliniMetrica automatically indexes digital audio recording of assessment interviews, and was developed with SBIR support from NIMH Digital video functions are currently being implemented and tested with additional NIMH support, as are functions to support remote psychometrics for the training and monitoring of interviewers.  The CliniMetrica system is increasing in sophistication and functionality, and has applications for clinical research (e.g., clinical trials) as well as for more routine clinical practice.  The current lack of fully developed and tested diagnostic functionality is a major gap.  A number of potential customers have requested integrated DSM-IV and/or lCD-10 diagnostic results to be automatically linked to assessments.  In order to meet this market need, we propose to implement the DSM-IV and ICD-10 nosologic systems as two classification knowledge bases that a logic engine will process to generate diagnostic results.  These logical functions are difficult to implement and manipulate with procedural languages (e. g. C + +). so the use of a logic engine provides significant technical benefits.  This diagnostic logic version of CliniMetrica is referred to as ""CliniMetrica-Dx.""  To assist raters in thorough examination and to support adaptive assessment, a user interface coupled to logic processing modules will allow tracking the diagnostic status of a subject (the sets of true, false, partially true, or partially false DSM-IV and lCD-10 diagnoses during assessment.  The logic engine will dynamically generate assessment item subsets (currently from the SCAN) needed to rule-in or rule-out DSM-IV and lCD-10 diagnoses. During the assessment, presentation of these symptom sets to the assessor can further guide the interview. By narrowing the ""search space,"" the efficiency of assessments will be increased. By formalizing the search, reliability and validity can be enhanced In addition, to provide support for nosologic research and development, in Phase II the system will include mappings between DSM-IV and lCD-10, and between current and future versions of the DSM and lCD.  The CliniMetrica-Dx system as an application framework will generalize to other clinical psychiatric assessment instruments such as the SCID, to adaptive self-report systems, and to other medical specialties.  It also will have applications for education and training.   n/a",Diagnostic Logic and Adaptive Assessment for Psychiatry,6549963,R43MH066434,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder classification', ' human subject', ' indexing', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' psychometrics']",NIMH,"MEDICAL DECISION LOGIC, INC.",R43,2002,94169,-0.0015221372696045642
"Actuarial Generation of Diagnostic Possibilities in Ment  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The primary goal of this Phase I project is to test the feasibility of a computerized diagnostic tool for collaborative assessment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents.  Such a system is sorely needed in both clinical and research settings because (a) structured clinical interviews, although the gold standard in diagnosis, are time consuming and underutilized, and (b) the clinical judgment that is often substituted is of Limited accuracy and subject to several significant biases.  Using the diagnostic rules from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), the proposed product will provide clinicians with automated actuarial symptom and diagnostic data thereby circumventing these limitations while assisting the collaborative diagnostic process.  These goals will be accomplished by integrating a reliable and valid symptom checklist filled out by patient informants with an advanced rule-based documentation system that employs an established logic-processing engine and which utilizes the complete DSM-IV rule set.  Based on the presence and severity of discrete symptoms, clinicians will be provided with actuarially derived probability values that indicate the likelihood of specific DSM-IV criteria or disorders.  Additionally, it will facilitate rapid and complete documentation DSM-IV criterion necessary to formally validate or refute diagnoses.  The improved integration of client and clinician information will provide increased diagnostic precision and facilitate collaboration between providers and clients.  In Phase II, the system will be extended to support repeated assessment, direct access via the World Wide Web, and larger sampling to collect further psychometric information.  Phase I objectives include: 1. To produce a highly usable collaborative diagnostic assessment tool that will be used by individual practitioners, small group practices and their clients.  2. To automate the determination of the positive and negative predictive power of informant symptom data for corresponding DSM-IV criterion and diagnoses, and to collect an initial data set to evaluate usability and psychometric properties of the system.  Phase II objectives include: (1) creation of a user interfaces and program logic to support repeated assessment (2) scaling to provide direct access via the World Wide Web and (3) larger sampling to extend the known psychometric properties of the system.

"Automated PCR Pathogen Detection and Quantification  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We will develop software for automated pathogen detection and quantification using data from PCR experiments. Automated pathogen detection using data from a PCR experiment requires software to determine whether DNA from the pathogen is present or absent in a sample. We will develop a pattern-matching algorithm to mathematically analyze PCR amplification data. We will optimize the algorithm against a data set of at least 5000 PCR reactions (including a significant set of data gathered during the anthrax attack) to determine its efficacy and limitations. We expect the pathogen detection algorithms to distinguish positives samples from negative samples in more than 98% of the samples, to find inconclusive results in less than 1% of the samples, and to incorrectly classify less than 1% of the samples. We will also develop software to perform automated melting curve analysis of samples that our detection algorithm has determined to be positive or inconclusive. The melting profile of the probes is a property of the assay, and it can be used for secondary confirmation of a pathogen by comparing the profile of the unknown samples to the profile of the assay's positive controls. We will develop algorithms to automatically determine whether the melting profile of the sample and controls match. With melting analysis confirmation, the failure rate of the final detection algorithm should be less than 0.5%.   Automated pathogen quantification requires software to determine the number of copies of a pathogen's DNA in a sample. We will develop discrete dynamical models of PCR for quantification. We will optimize these methods against a large data set of PCR reactions with dilution series. We will systematically determine the features of the models that provide information and the features that can be ignored. We will measure efficacy by comparing computed DNA copy numbers against the known concentrations (as specified by experimenters), and against each other. We will use the most effective model (or models) in the software we produce.   n/a",Automated PCR Pathogen Detection and Quantification,6555484,R43AI052944,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioterrorism /chemical warfare', ' communicable disease diagnosis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' microorganism', ' nucleic acid denaturation', ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' phase change', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NIAID,IDAHO TECHNOLOGY,R43,2002,100000,-0.0073647664638019274
"Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This training grant is designed to advance the academic career of Dr. Indu Ayappa by building on the applicant?s strong biomedical engineering and computer background and providing comprehensive multi-disciplinary training which will allow her to become an independent investigator. The applicant?s career goals are to enter full time academic research in sleep physiology. Training activities proposed will include academic course work designed to support the research program and expose her to aspects of clinical research in sleep, neural science and artificial intelligence techniques. She will be mentored by David Rapoport, M.D., Joyce Walsleben, Ph.D., and Maurice Ohayon, M.D., Ph.D., as well as faculty in computer science and neurophysiology. The aims of the planned research are to develop an artificial intelligence system for the identification and quantification of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) based solely on non-invasive cardiopulmonary signals collected during routine polysomnography. This will simplify, standardize and improve the diagnosis of SDB and facilitate research in this area. With the long term goal of physiologic characterization of the spectrum of SDB in order to clinically diagnose upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), the aims of this project are to: 1. Extract features from the nasal cannula airflow signal to characterize the state of resistance/collapsibility of individual breaths. These include amplitude, inspiratory flow contour, Ti/Ttot and presence of vibration which will be used as inputs to a neural network that will be trained and evaluated against breaths that have been classified by reference measurement of upper airway resistance (pressure/flow). 2A. Incorporate information from this classification of individual breaths to detect and classify respiratory events based on the flow signal alone using a trained neural network. 2B. Evaluate the utility of including additional cardiopulmonary signals like oxygen saturation, heart rate, pulse transit time and rib/abdominal movements (amplitude and phase) in the detection and classification of these events.

"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6529026,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', ' age difference', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain electrical activity', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' electroencephalography', ' epilepsy', ' human subject', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks)', ' patient monitoring device', ' patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2002,193637,-0.003623362411880283
"KNOWLEDGED BASED SYSTEMS FOR DIAGNOSTIC HISTOPATHOLOGY  The proposed work extends previous research performed by this                                                                     investigator in the field of knowledge-based systems for the analysis of             histopathologic material, mainly neoplastic tissue; and mostly focusing on           adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics.

"ACTUARIAL STRATEGIES IN CHILD DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT  The proposed project involves a preliminary investigation of                                                                                   potentially significant methodological advance in diagnostic assessment. The         current state-of-the-art in diagnostic assessment involves the use of a              structured interview. Typically, structured interviews involve a static skip         structure, i.e., some portions of the interview are administered conditional on                                 particular responses to prior questions. For example, if there is a negative         response to a question about depression and anhedonia, most structured               interviews require the clinical to skip the remaining questions about                associated symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, etc.).         Although structured interviews represent an enormous advantage over earlier          diagnostic procedures, their inflexible structure is often incompatible with         the heterogeneity of most child and adolescent populations, and can result in        superfluous questioning about uncommon disorders and insufficient follow-up          about more common ones. Many interviews do not make exceptions for individual        characteristics. For example, 1) a 17 year old boy might need to answer ""no"" to      5 or 6 questions about separation anxiety before the interviewer may move on to      another set of questions; or 2) an underweight 16 year old girl might not be         asked important follow-up questions when replying ""no"" to the initial question       about eating disorders. One might conclude that introducing more clinician           flexibility would be the solution; however, the literature on clinical judgment      suggests that increasing clinician involvement in determination of interview         structure would likely degrade classification accuracy and introduce unwanted        sources of error and bias. To address this issue in another manner, the              principal investigator has developed a data-driven, actuarial expert system to       guide a flexible interview structure. Thus, interview structure is dynamically       responsive to individual characteristics, without introducing error associated       with qualitative clinical judgments. Pilot modeling revealed that his system         offers advantages in classification accuracy over state-of-the-art diagnostic        approaches, with the additional benefit of reducing administration time for          particular disorders. The current project is planned to generate requisite data      to develop a formal expert system and to forecast its relative accuracy and          efficiency in a child and adolescent population. It is predicted that this           system will demonstrate improvements in classification accuracy over a static        structured interview approach, with reduced administration time. If the data         are supportive, these developments have the potential to significantly advance       the manner in which future diagnostic interviews are conducted with mental           health populations.                                                                                                                                                       n/a",ACTUARIAL STRATEGIES IN CHILD DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT,6392530,R03MH060134,"['adolescence (12-20)', ' anxiety', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' child (0-11)', ' child behavior disorders', ' child psychology', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' depression', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human subject', ' interview', ' mathematical model', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' model design /development', ' mood disorders', ' psychometrics', ' questionnaires']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,R03,2001,60756,-0.00045960857533497895

This will simplify, standardize and improve the diagnosis of SDB and facilitate research in this area. With the long term goal of physiologic characterization of the spectrum of SDB in order to clinically diagnose upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), the aims of this project are to: 1. Extract features from the nasal cannula airflow signal to characterize the state of resistance/collapsibility of individual breaths. These include amplitude, inspiratory flow contour, Ti/Ttot and presence of vibration which will be used as inputs to a neural network that will be trained and evaluated against breaths that have been classified by reference measurement of upper airway resistance (pressure/flow). 2A. Incorporate information from this classification of individual breaths to detect and classify respiratory events based on the flow signal alone using a trained neural network. 2B. Evaluate the utility of including additional cardiopulmonary signals like oxygen saturation, heart rate, pulse transit time and rib/abdominal movements (amplitude and phase) in the detection and classification of these events. Successful completion of the training and research program will allow Dr. Ayappa to contribute independently to research in the field of sleep physiology. n/a",Automated (AI) Analysis of Sleep Disordered Breathing,6320670,K25HL004420,"['artificial intelligence', ' automated data processing', ' breath tests', ' cardiopulmonary disease', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' disease /disorder classification', ' electrocardiography', ' electroencephalography', ' electromyography', ' electrooculography', ' human subject', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' patient oriented research', ' polysomnography', ' respiratory airflow disorder', ' respiratory airflow measurement', ' respiratory disorder diagnosis', ' sleep disorders']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K25,2001,147450,0.012899212896906735
"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6383999,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', ' age difference', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain electrical activity', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' electroencephalography', ' epilepsy', ' human subject', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks)', ' patient monitoring device', ' patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2001,200999,-0.003623362411880283

"ACTUARIAL STRATEGIES IN CHILD DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT  The proposed project involves a preliminary investigation of                                                                                   potentially significant methodological advance in diagnostic assessment. The         current state-of-the-art in diagnostic assessment involves the use of a              structured interview. Typically, structured interviews involve a static skip         structure, i.e., some portions of the interview are administered conditional on                                 particular responses to prior questions. For example, if there is a negative         response to a question about depression and anhedonia, most structured               interviews require the clinical to skip the remaining questions about                associated symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, etc.).         Although structured interviews represent an enormous advantage over earlier          diagnostic procedures, their inflexible structure is often incompatible with         the heterogeneity of most child and adolescent populations, and can result in        superfluous questioning about uncommon disorders and insufficient follow-up          about more common ones. Many interviews do not make exceptions for individual        characteristics. For example, 1) a 17 year old boy might need to answer ""no"" to      5 or 6 questions about separation anxiety before the interviewer may move on to      another set of questions; or 2) an underweight 16 year old girl might not be         asked important follow-up questions when replying ""no"" to the initial question       about eating disorders. One might conclude that introducing more clinician           flexibility would be the solution; however, the literature on clinical judgment      suggests that increasing clinician involvement in determination of interview         structure would likely degrade classification accuracy and introduce unwanted        sources of error and bias. To address this issue in another manner, the              principal investigator has developed a data-driven, actuarial expert system to       guide a flexible interview structure. Thus, interview structure is dynamically       responsive to individual characteristics, without introducing error associated       with qualitative clinical judgments. Pilot modeling revealed that his system         offers advantages in classification accuracy over state-of-the-art diagnostic        approaches, with the additional benefit of reducing administration time for          particular disorders. The current project is planned to generate requisite data      to develop a formal expert system and to forecast its relative accuracy and          efficiency in a child and adolescent population. It is predicted that this           system will demonstrate improvements in classification accuracy over a static        structured interview approach, with reduced administration time. If the data         are supportive, these developments have the potential to significantly advance       the manner in which future diagnostic interviews are conducted with mental           health populations.                                                                                                                                                       n/a",ACTUARIAL STRATEGIES IN CHILD DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT,6096946,R03MH060134,"['adolescence (12-20)', ' anxiety', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' child (0-11)', ' child behavior disorders', ' child psychology', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' depression', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human subject', ' interview', ' mathematical model', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' model design /development', ' mood disorders', ' psychometrics', ' questionnaires']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,R03,2000,63589,-0.00045960857533497895
"ADVANCED DIAGNOSTIC LOGIC FOR PSYCHIATRY   DESCRIPTION: (Verbatim from the Applicant's Abstract): This Phase I project          proposes to assess the feasibility of an advanced diagnostic logic system            (Diagnostica) to support the clinical assessment process for diagnosis in            psychiatry. A working prototype of the diagnostic rules in the American              Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) uses and          artificial intelligence engine (""XSB"") to implement the logic of DSM-IV along        with and an interactive graphical user interface to allow a user to add              information and understand conclusions reached by the system. The Phase I            programming objectives are to make Diagnostica ready for commercial use by           improving its graphical user interface, and finalizing implementation of its         logical rules. The resulting system will be a practical tool in clinical             settings, and relies on computer science innovations that have preciously            neither been explored nor applied in the domain of medical reasoning. With the       emergence of decision support systems, the need for better quality diagnostic        information is becoming increasingly apparent. This has been due, in part, to        the complexity of diagnostic processes and the emphasis on support of financial      processes. Within mental health, the DSM-IV provides both a model and a              standard for making diagnoses. A software component that provides flexible,          complete, and efficient application of this standard is of great value. The          innovation of Diagnostica relies on the sophistication of its modeling of            DSM-IV rules, and it's flexibility in applying those rules. Diagnostica will         automatically track the status of the information entered and allow users to         tie up 'loose ends' in documenting the proof of diagnoses formally. AS example,      the user may indicate that a set of diagnoses in 'believed true' without             specifying the symptoms needed to make the diagnoses formally ( a procedure          used routinely in clinical practice). the application will track whatever            'residual' data this is necessary in order to complete formal diagnoses, while       leaving the option of when, or if, to complete the process up to the user.                                                                                                Phase II objectives include: (1) extending Diagnostica to provide other              software applications needing diagnostic decision support services, and              specifically to link Diagnostica to the World Health Organization Schedules for      Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN); (2) addressing logical modeling       of time and creating an effective user interface for repeated assessment; (3)        incorporating probabilistic information about sets of symptoms based on              empirical information initially obtained in Phase I; and (4) developing and          testing ""belief revision"" functions to changes in knowledge stemming from            repeated clinical assessment.

"KNOWLEDGE BASES FOR STRUCTURED CARDIOVASCULAR REPORTING Healthcare has lagged behind other industries in automating the storage and retrieval of information. While billing, blood testing, and other services are widely computerized, the bulk of patient clinical information is not. The central barrier to coding clinically useful data - patient historical, test, and procedural results - is the absence of effective knowledge frameworks for entry and review of clinical data. For this reason, sofiware for storage and retrieval of patient data remains suboptimal. This project focuses on methods for recording a specific subset of patient data: results of cardiovascular tests, Although only a subset of clinical knowledge, cardiovascular procedure reporting is typical of the larger problem of how knowledge is handled. Moreover, there is an unmet market demand for cardiology reportrng tools. In Phase I we will develop a methodology for creating and maintaining the knowledge bases needed for structured entry of cardiovascular data. We will apply and hone this methodology by creating two important knowledge bases: echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. Together with the methodology we use, these two developments will dovetail into a larger Phase II  project of systematically addressing knowledge-representation and structured data entry for cardiology. Beyond Phase II  we will apply our methodology to other branches of medicine.

"MODEL BASED INTERPRETATION OF INTRACARDIAC ELECTROGRAMS Catheter ablation is a medical procedure that involves the destruction of        small volumes of heart tissue with radiofrequency energy.  To be                 successful, catheter ablation requires precise localization of the tissue        to be destroyed. To accomplish this in a typical ablation procedure, five        catheters containing a total of 19 electrode pairs are utilized to record        potentials (called electrograms) from spatially distinct locations within        the heart throughout the cardiac cycle. Experienced cardiologists                interpret the electrograms to locate the conduction pathways responsible         for the arrhythmia. The pathways are destroyed by applications of                radiofrequency energy, thus treating the arrhythmia.                                                                                                              Ablation procedures are performed by highly trained and experienced              cardiology sub-specialists yet the massive amount of data produced during        these procedures creates a data overload problem that can impede the             performance of even the best practitioners. This may be evidenced by (1)         overlooking important signal features, (2) misinterpreting the signals,          and (3) misinterpreting catheter locations in the heart, all of which may        lead to increased procedure duration and/or applications of radiofrequency       energy to the wrong part of the heart.                                                                                                                            The purpose of this project is to develop a model-based system for               interpreting intracardiac electrograms in near real-time. The system is          intended to assist physicians in ""making sense"" of the enormous amounts of       data recorded during a cardiac electrophysiology study. New computer             algorithms for reasoning about the time- and space-varying nature of             intracardiac electrograms from underlying causal models of the heart will        be developed. The models can be represented as a graph of nodes connected        by arcs. The nodes represent specific an atomic regions of the heart while       the arcs represent the connections between the regions.                                                                                                           The analytic approach will be a variation of the hypothesize-and-test            paradigm. The control loop will be based on the ""tracking"" concept whereby       models will be tracked as long as the data supports the model. Rule-based        knowledge will be utilized to generate models based on the observed data.        The output of the system will be a series of ladder diagrams describing          the data. In the event that the data admits more than a single explanatory       model, ladder diagrams will be generated for all created models.                                                                                                  This proposal is an extension of the applicant's graduate and post-              doctoral project, which used the same approach to the simpler domain of          the interpretation of the body-surface electrocardiogram. The domain of          this proposal is more complex because it adds reasoning with a more              detailed three dimensional cardiac model to the temporal reasoning               required for previous work. Also, this domain requires the ability to            account for simultaneous activation of the heart at multiple locations,          which was performed at a rudimentary level in the previous work.                                                                                                  This project is important for three reasons: (1) it offers new knowledge-        based algorithms for reasoning about time- and space-varying data, (2) a         comprehensive and extensible model of the cardiac conduction will be             created that incorporates the spatial resolution necessary for                   interpreting intracardiac electrograms, and (3) a software tool such the         one proposed may help clinicians improve the quality of health care.              n/a",MODEL BASED INTERPRETATION OF INTRACARDIAC ELECTROGRAMS,6126011,R29LM006004,"['arrhythmia', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' electrocardiography', ' heart catheterization', ' heart conduction system', ' human data', ' interactive multimedia', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development']",NLM,SOUTHWEST RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R29,2000,149839,-0.007563680148658746

"CLASSIFICATION METHODS FOR DETECTING DISEASE LOCI DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract): Bold steps must be       taken to advance our understanding of the genetic and associated co-             variates affecting the inheritance of complex diseases. To that end, this        proposal will develop improved quantitative methods to detect genetic            factors contributing to increased susceptibility to complex disorders and        implement these methods in software for distribution to the research             community.                                                                                                                                                        The methods will concentrate on the use of classification techniques             applied to allele sharing data and other risk factors which affect the           trait. Allele sharing methods for mapping genes will be extended to              include the classification methods known as latent class models, cluster         analysis, and artificial neural networks, as well as a novel use of              logistic regression Co-variates such as gender, parental diagnosis, or           other concomitant factors will be systematically studied through                 applications to both stimulated and existing data sets. An additional goal       is to determine the optimal distribution of relative pairs (e.g. siblings,       first cousins) for these methods. Of great importance to this proposal is        the development of well-documented, user-friendly software and                   documentation which will be distributed to the scientific community via          the Internet. Existing software developed by the PI will be extensively          expanded for latent class models. Existing cluster analysis software will        be modified and combined for ease of use.                                                                                                                         This proposal consists of theoretical exploration, computer simulation,          data analysis, and software development. First, solutions of theoretical         questions relating to classification techniques will be pursued; second,         adaptation of computer programs to implement the analytic methods, and           investigation into alternative research strategies will be accomplished.         The new strategies will be applied to stimulated data, and finally, to           existing data sets of pedigrees in which a complex trait has been                diagnosed. Findings from this research may contribute to the ability to          locate susceptibility loci in complex traits and to the clarification of         those etiological mechanisms responsible for susceptibility.                      n/a",CLASSIFICATION METHODS FOR DETECTING DISEASE LOCI,6168495,R01AA012239,"['alleles', ' analytical method', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomedical resource', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' disease /disorder classification', ' disease /disorder etiology', ' family genetics', ' gene environment interaction', ' gene expression', ' genetic disorder', ' genetic disorder diagnosis', ' genetic mapping', ' genetic markers', ' genetic susceptibility', ' human data', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' quantitative trait loci', ' statistics /biometry']",NIAAA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,180260,-0.026849240072383748
"NEW ROC METHODOLOGY TO ASSESS DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract):  Receiver Operating             Characteristic (ROC) analysis is recognized widely as the best way of            measuring and specifying the accuracies of diagnostic procedures, because it     is able to distinguish between actual differences in discrimination              capacity, on one hand, and apparent differences that are due only to             decision-threshold effects, on the other.  Key methodological needs remain       to be satisfied before ROC analysis can address all of the practically           important situations that arise in diagnostic applications, however.  This       project employs signal detection theory and computer simulation to address       several of those needs, by:  (1) refining and continuing distribution of         software developed previously by the applicants for fitting ROC curves and       for testing the statistical significance of differences between ROC curve        estimates; (2) developing and evaluating new algorithms for ROC                  curve-Fitting and statistical testing, based on their recently-developed         ""proper"" binormal model, that should provide more meaningful results in          experimental situations that involve small samples of cases; (3)                 investigating the usefulness of a form of ROC methodology that is based on       mixture distributions in order to rduce the need for diagnostic truth in ROC     experiments; (4) investigating the effect of case-saple difficulty on the        statistical power tests for differences between ROC curves, in order to          determine the optimal difficulty of cases that shouldbe studied on rank          diagnostic systems; and (5) developing methods for training artificial           neural networks (ANNs) to maximize diagnostic accuracy in terms of ROC           analysis and signal detection theory.                                             n/a",NEW ROC METHODOLOGY TO ASSESS DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY,6181168,R01GM057622,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' method development', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2000,218176,-0.01817386245486535
"DECISION SUPPORT SOFTWARE TO TRIAGE FOR SKIN CANCER Many primary care physicians are unable to proficiently triage skin lesions suspicious for cancer, compromising patients' health. Decision support software could help in the early detection of skin cancer, decreasing morbidity and mortality related to skin cancer misdiagnoses. It also could reduce unnecessary referrals to specialists, lowering health care costs. In Phase I, we demonstrated that decision support software can significantly improve physicians' ability to arrive at appropriate triage decisions for a variety skin lesions, including cancerous lesions. In Phase II, we propose to l) expand the decision support software to triage for pigmented lesions and a wider range of nonpigmented skin lesions; 2) incorporate case-based reasoning methods into the software to enable users to conduct a confidence check on their final triage decision and to help them make the correct decision at each branch point in the decision tree; 3) develop a teaching application based on the decision tree; 4) enable the software to produce for patients individualized information on skin cancer prevention and treatment; 5) interface the decision support software with the computerized patient medical record; and 6) test the effectiveness, utility, and feasibility of the decision support software with a sample of primary care physicians and patients. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: This research is designed to produce comprehensive decision support software that will be a commercially viable product. Two large potential markets for this product are medical schools, which may use the software as a teaching aid, and medical settings, which may use the software as a clinical tool for practicing primary care physicians.  n/a",DECISION SUPPORT SOFTWARE TO TRIAGE FOR SKIN CANCER,6172710,R44CA075906,"['cancer information system', ' cancer prevention', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' medical records', ' melanoma', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer therapy', ' pigments', ' skin neoplasms']",NCI,WEST PORTAL SOFTWARE CORPORATION,R44,2000,329958,-0.0318521392786686
"KNOWLEDGE BASED SYSTEMS FOR DIAGNOSTIC HISTOPATHOLOGY DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract):  Knowledge-guided, fully        automated image analytic procedures will be applied, and further developed       for the extraction of diagnostic and prognostic information from                 histopathologic sections.  It is proposed to develop knowledge files for the     grading of solar lesions, for the analysis of prostatic intraepithelial          neoplastic lesions (PIN), for benign proliferative epithelial lesions of the     breast, and for kidney tumors.  Quantitative progression indices will be         derived from histometric measurements.  These may serve to identify patients     at high risk to develop infiltrating disease, to measure rate of lesion          progression, and to allow a numeric assessment of the efficacy of                chemopreventive intervention.                                                                                                                                     Knowledge files are under development for a quantitative measurement of the      vascularization around PIN lesions.                                                                                                                               For nuclei, lesions and patients, novel methodology is proposed to               characterize these entities by identification, rather than by mere               classification.  This will allow a significantly more precise                    characterization of the nuceli in a lesion and of the state of lesion            progression.  The identification methods will be integrated into the current     diagnostic decision support system, and be given capabilities to handle          missing data, contradictory evidence, atypical diagnostic clue expression.       This capability relies on automated reasoning will be developed, and the         methodology will be adapted for used in histopathologic diagnosis.                n/a",KNOWLEDGE BASED SYSTEMS FOR DIAGNOSTIC HISTOPATHOLOGY,6137486,R01CA053877,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' breast neoplasms', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' digital imaging', ' histopathology', ' image processing', ' information system analysis', ' kidney neoplasms', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' prognosis', ' prostate neoplasms']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2000,442719,-0.03472164868433956
