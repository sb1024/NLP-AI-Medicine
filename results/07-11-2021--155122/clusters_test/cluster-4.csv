"Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients Project Summary  Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and aggressive form of brain cancer affecting up to 20,000 new patients in the US every year. Standard of care therapies include stereotactic surgical resection, radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. After initial treatment, patient monitoring is guided by standard MR imaging performed at routine intervals. Despite these rigorous therapies, current median survival is only 15 months. Imaging is a central part of brain tumor management, but MRI findings in brain tumor patients can be challenging to interpret and is further confounded by interpretation variability. Accurate interpretation of imaging is particularly important during the post-treatment phase of patient care as it can help clinicians proactively manage disease through early, precise characterization of true tumor recurrence. Disease-specific structured reporting systems attempt to reduce variability in imaging results by implementing well-defined imaging criteria and standardized language. The Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS), developed at Emory University, is one such framework streamlined for clinical workflows and includes quantitative criteria for more objective evaluation of follow-up imaging. While BT-RADS has had success with clinical adoptability, it still faces hurdles reducing interobserver variability and improving objective classification of disease state.  This proposed study addresses an unmet need for unbiased, quantitative metrics for robust, objective interpretation of follow-up imaging for GBM patients. Where previous evaluative methods used two-dimensional, representative MRI slices for evaluating the extent of tumor, we propose to develop a deep learning segmentation tool, accurately calculating volumes of tumor after surgical resection, and trained from our expansive database of patient data with contours manually drawn by radiation oncologists. Further, we propose to develop computationally advanced software for predicting disease progression building upon the clinically developed BT- RADS criteria. Such tools would assist physicians in caring for brain tumor patients through post-treatment surveillance and guide future clinical decision making. In addition, we believe these quantitative metrics would have unbounded potential in clinical trial settings where it may be difficult to evaluate the efficacy of novel therapeutics for GBM. Therefore, these assistive tools will be tested on clinical trial data to determine if they are superior to conventional measurements alone.  A fundamental goal of this proposal is ensuring the quantitative tools we develop are applicable for clinicians in their daily lives. Therefore, an effort will be made to collaborate extensively with clinicians to house the algorithms in sleek, intuitive software for physicians to utilize. Through the multidisciplinary environment, high performance computing, and clinical resources we have available, we believe this proposal will be successful in developing clinically assistive tools for unbiased, objective monitoring of GBM patients in clinical settings and evaluation of novel therapies in research settings. Project Narrative  Follow-up imaging for glioblastoma patients is challenging to interpret due to subjectivity in evaluating disease state and overlap between treatment effects and tumor progression. More objective follow-up criteria are vital for sensitive and accurate monitoring of glioblastoma patients after initial treatment to ensure proactive management of disease and accurate characterization of tumor recurrence. This research proposal will develop user-friendly quantitative software for lesion segmentation and disease-state assessment, providing unbiased metrics for post-treatment patient monitoring and guidance of management decisions in clinical and research settings.",Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients,10071871,F31CA247564,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Future', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Information Systems', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'aggressive therapy', 'automated image analysis', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'implementation framework', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'quantitative imaging', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Network mechanisms and bioengineering of precision immunotherapies for glioblastomas Project Summary/Abstract Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal malignancy of the human central nervous system (CNS). This devastating disease has a median overall survival of 3 months from time of diagnosis in untreated patients. Despite the significant cost and morbidity with standard of care surgical resection combined with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, life expectancy is only extended by a few months. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are a class of immunotherapies with an FDA-approved treatment for solid tumors. These work by directly lysing tumor cells, which then release tumor antigens with danger signals that elicit antitumor immunity. Adenovirus is a strong candidate OV immunotherapy for GBM because of its low neurotoxicity when delivered by intratumoral injection and its amenability to bioengineering. Ad5-Δ24, an adenovirus modified to replicate in GBM but not in other CNS cells, is perhaps the most promising OV in clinical trials. Major hurdles remain, however, including innate immunoresistance. This study will overcome these by elucidating complex tumor-OV interaction mechanisms at the systems level, designing and constructing improved OV candidates that exploit these mechanisms, and then validating the mechanisms by experimentally testing the OVs. Preliminary studies for this proposal demonstrate that GBM patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have distinct transcriptomes in vivo and can be cultured as neurospheres (Sp-GBMs) under serum-free conditions ex vivo. Ad5-Δ24 OV can lyse several different Sp-GBMs ex vivo and the level of this oncolytic activity is PDX specific. Additionally, preliminary in silico models suggest that such OV activity levels are contextually dependent on protein-protein interaction networks in the target GBM cells. This project will test the central hypothesis that dynamic transcriptional states of human GBM play key mechanistic roles in Ad5-Δ24 oncolytic efficacy; therefore, modeling the emergent system behaviors will guide the engineering of precision OV immunotherapies. The first aim will classify human GBM PDXs using transcriptomes to predict Ad5-Δ24 OV responses and identify context-specific network features. The resulting classifier and network models will be validated by assessing their ability to predict the response of Sp-GBM to Ad5-Δ24 OV treatment. The second aim will elucidate Ad5- Δ24 OV gene dependencies and resistance mechanisms in human GBM PDXs. Predictions from both aims will both experimentally and computationally validated. Synthetic Ad5-Δ24 OVs with shRNAs that perturb these gene dependencies and resistance mechanisms will be constructed and tested for efficacy. These precisely targeted alterations result in the quantifiable, predictable phenotypic effects of modulating human GBM gene expression and oncolysis ex vivo and in vivo. Such synthetic OVs will be useful as GBM research tools. As a future direction, the big data generated will be a valuable public resource to further interrogate antitumor immunity and inflammation states. Successful completion of these aims will yield novel GBM diagnostic subtypes with paired engineered OVs ready for preclinical development as precision immunotherapies. Project Narrative Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common lethal brain tumor. This research aims to develop a novel immunotherapy using engineered viruses to treat this tumor with minimal side effects. The results from this study will also provide mechanistic insight into the disease and guide future clinical trials to treat this tumor.",Network mechanisms and bioengineering of precision immunotherapies for glioblastomas,10231604,F30CA250122,"['Adenoviruses', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Astrocytes', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glioblastoma', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inflammation', 'Injections', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferons', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neuraxis', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Serotyping', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'efficacy testing', 'immune resistance', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'multiple omics', 'neoplastic cell', 'network models', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'oncolysis', 'oncolytic adenovirus', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'preclinical development', 'predicting response', 'protein protein interaction', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'retinoblastoma tumor suppressor', 'side effect', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'small hairpin RNA', 'standard of care', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis', 'viral resistance']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,F30,2021,46236
"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,10159875,R00CA230195,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'refractory cancer', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R00,2021,153920
"Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis Abstract: Metastasis from the primary tumor site to the brain is the most lethal complication of cancer progression and is experienced by approximately 20% of breast cancer patients worldwide. There is at present no translational approach to detect if a primary tumor has brain metastatic potential, no markers that predict successful future metastasis, and thus no therapies to target any of the processes involved. These gaps are difficult to bridge due to a lack of technology that can classify a cancer cell’s brain metastatic potential. Current in vivo murine models are slow to manifest metastasis and do not have the capability of capturing single cell morphology and dynamics; therefore, we propose a diagnostic platform to measure the phenotypic differences between cancer cells and to assign them a brain metastatic potential. The output is a quantitative diagnostic read out that defines the probability of a patient's cell metastasizing to the brain. Preliminary data suggests we may use this platform to brain metastatic behavior in 24-72 hrs. We have demonstrated that we can classify non-brain seeking and brain seeking cell lines based on phenotypic metrics such as migration, extravasation, shape and volume with a positive predictive value of 0.9. This study will validate the performance of this platform on patient cells. Further we aim to understand what components of the brain stromal space promote brain metastasis to further improve the performance of this technology and identify candidates that could be targeted by therapeutics to prevent metastasis in patients that have been identified as at risk. In summary, we propose a unique approach to measure the individual metastatic potential of tumor cells spatially and temporally. This work will result in both improved clinical stratification and, downstream from it, in a more robust set of targetable pathways for prevention of brain metastasis from breast and other primary sites. Public health narrative: This grant would help develop a new clinical approach to predicting the progression of primary cancer into brain metastasis. This is the most lethal complication of breast cancer. Preventing this would save lives and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year.",Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis,10109103,R21CA245597,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast cancer metastasis', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical stratification', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Extravasation', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer cell', 'cancer complication', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'diagnostic platform', 'diagnostic technologies', 'experience', 'histological slides', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in-vitro diagnostics', 'indexing', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'operation', 'organ on a chip', 'pathology imaging', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tomography', 'translational approach', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2021,182325
"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.

"Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search Project Summary When looking at an x-ray, radiologists are typically asked to localize a tumor (if present), and to classify it, judging its size, class, position and so on. Importantly, during this task, radiologists examine on a daily basis hundreds and hundreds of x-rays, seeing several images one after the other. A main underlying assumption of this task is that radiologists’ percepts and decisions on a current X-ray are completely independent of prior events. Recent results showed that this is not true: our perception and decisions are strongly biased by our past visual experience. Although serial dependencies were proposed to be a purposeful mechanism to achieve perceptual stability of our otherwise noisy visual input, serial dependencies play a crucial and deleterious role in the everyday task performed by radiologists. For example, an x-ray containing a tumor can be classified as benign depending on the content of the previously seen x-ray. Given the importance and the impact of serial dependencies in clinical tasks, in this proposal, we plan to (1) establish, (2) identify and (3) mitigate the conditions under which serial effects determine our percepts and decisions in tumor search tasks. In Aim 1, we will establish the presence of serial effects in four different clinically relevant domains: tumor detection, tumor classification, tumor position and recognition speed. In Aim 2, we plan to identify the specific boundary conditions under which visual serial dependence impacts tumor search in radiology. In Aim 3, once we will fully understand these boundary conditions in Aim 2, we will propose a series of task and stimulus manipulations to control and mitigate the deleterious effects of visual serial dependence on tumor search. As a result of these manipulations, visual search performance should improve in measurable ways (detection, classification, position, speed). Aim 3 is particularly crucial because it will allow us to propose new guidelines which will greatly improve tumor recognition in x-ray images, making this task even more effective and reliable. Taken together, the proposed studies in Aim 1, 2, and 3 will allow us to establish, identify, and mitigate the deleterious effect of serial dependencies in radiological search tasks, which could have a significant impact on the health and well-being of patients everywhere. ! ! ! Project Narrative Our proposal is designed to investigate the detrimental impact of visual serial dependencies in clinical settings. Serial dependencies significantly impact our perceptual experience, but little is known about their detrimental consequences when radiologists are asked to detect tumors in x-rays. Crucially, the final goal of our research project is to develop recommendations and guidelines to mitigate the negative effect of serial effects and, thus, improve diagnosis accuracy.",Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search,10137898,R01CA236793,"['Benign', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'radiologist', 'tumor', 'visual search']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,311975
"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue.

"Developing new therapeutic strategies for pediatric tumors that lack clinically actionable mutations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cancer is the leading disease-related cause of death in children. Treatment has remained largely unchanged in decades, relying primarily on aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation—these therapies have debilitating long-term consequences. Precision medicine has yet to make a major impact on childhood cancer because, while thousands of pediatric tumor genomes have been sequenced, most children have very few somatic mutations compared to adult cancers. This means targeted cancer drugs are not an option for most children and fewer tumor-specific neoantigens means most immunotherapies are ineffective. However, in the last 5 years, large-scale CRISPR and drug screening studies in cancer cell lines, such as the Dependency Map (DepMap), have shown that in many cancers, unmutated genes can also act as potent drug targets. These genes are known as non-oncogene dependencies. The overall goal of this project is to overcome the low mutation burden, by identifying the druggable non-oncogene dependencies of pediatric tumors and to perform the requisite in vitro and in vivo experimental work to move these therapies to the clinic. We will identify these non-oncogene dependencies by applying tools from machine learning to perform integrative analysis of large pre-clinical screening datasets (such as DepMap, CCLE, and PRISM) with patient tumor -omics data. This will allow us to nominate specific non-oncogene dependencies for pediatric tumor subtypes, defined based on, for example, whole-genome gene expression or methylation data. We will mechanistically validate the top hits using in vitro experimental assays. Additionally, almost all curative cancer treatments involve the rational combination of multiple therapies, however, existing methods to predict effective combinations perform poorly when tested on unseen data. Thus, our second aim is to apply an approach that we have developed based on targeted CRISPR knockout screening to identify synergistic drug combinations. We will validate these combinations in vivo using mouse models with patient-derived xenografts, leveraging shared resources already established at St. Jude. Finally, tumor heterogeneity is ultimately the downfall of every known cancer treatment; however, in pediatric tumors where the mutation burden is low, much of this heterogeneity is driven by cell state, rather than specific somatic mutations. We will dissect the influence of cell state on drug resistance using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics technologies applied to a drug-treated spontaneous mouse model of neuroblastoma. This will ultimately allow us to nominate new drug combinations explicitly targeting drug-resistant cell states. Overall, this research program will aim to build a pipeline at St. Jude to overcome some of the main challenges posed by the low number of somatic mutations in pediatric tumors and identify new therapeutic strategies for these patients. We have assembled a diverse world-class team of researchers with all components necessary for an eventual impact on patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE The treatment of pediatric cancers has remained largely unchanged in decades, relying primarily on aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation, however, these therapies have debilitating long-term consequences. We will use new computational methodologies applied to large preclinical screening data from cancer cell lines and patient -omics datasets to investigate unmutated genes as potential drug targets in pediatric cancers (non-oncogene dependencies). We will perform the requisite downstream experimental work, including studying drug combinations and resistance mechanisms, necessary to motivate the clinical translation of our findings.",Developing new therapeutic strategies for pediatric tumors that lack clinically actionable mutations,10184211,R01CA260060,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bone neoplasms', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Cancer Treatment', 'Childhood Solid Neoplasm', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Encyclopedias', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resource Sharing', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical translation', 'clinically actionable', 'disorder subtype', 'genome sequencing', 'high risk', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mouse model', 'neoantigens', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rapid growth', 'resistance mechanism', 'resistance mutation', 'response', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'synergism', 'targeted cancer therapy', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole genome']",NCI,ST.

"Multi-scale modeling of glioma for the prediction of treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation Project summary Computational multi-scale modeling is a growing area of research that aims to link whole slide images and radiographic iamges with multi-omics molecular profiles of the same patients. Multi-scale modeling has shown its potential through its ability to predict clinical outcomes e.g. prognosis, and through predicting actionable molecular properties of tumors, e.g. the activity of EGFR, a major drug target in many cancers. Current applications are limited to study associations between imaging and molecular data, and predicting long term outcomes. No actionable information can be gained from multi-scale biomarkers yet. We propose to develop a multi-scale modeling framework to support treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation for patients with brain tumors, focusing on the most aggressive subtype of glioma, IDH wild-type high grade glioma. In Aim 1, we will develop informatics algorithms that integrate multi-scale data for treatment response. We will use our expertise in data fusion and develop novel approaches to integrate multi- scale data to predict first line treatment response. In Aim 2, we will develop algorithms that allow combining multi-scale data at diagnosis with multi-modal MR imaging data during treatment follow-up. We will focus on predicting treatment response and progression and whether we can predict these events earlier than radiologists can. In Aim 3, we will develop algorithms that use the multi-scale data to predict drug target activities and also suggest novel drugs for patients that become resistant to first line treatment. We will use a mixture of publicly available glioma multi-scale data sets totaling more than 1000 patients, and also 1600 retrospective and 150 prospective brain tumor patients from Stanford Medical Center. Combining these complementary data sources in a multi-scale framework for data fusion can have profound contributions toward predicting treatment outcomes by uncovering unknown synergies and relationships. More specifically, developing computational models integrating quantitative image features and molecular data to develop multi-scale signatures, holds the potential to translate in benefit to brain tumor patients by investigating biomarkers that accurately predict treatment response. Readily, because whole slide images and radiographic imaging is part of the routine diagnostic work-up of cancer patients and molecular data of brain tumors is increasingly being used in clinical workflows, therefore if reliable multi-scale signatures can be found reflecting treatment response, translation to clinical applications is feasible, including optimizing recruitment for clinical trials. Narrative We propose a multi-scale framework for treatment allocation, treatment follow-up and treatment monitoring to provide precision medicine for brain tumor patients. We will develop algorithms integrating clinical, molecular and imaging data for therapeutic purposes. We will focus on the development of multi-scale biomarkers that are predictive of treatment response, suggest the use of novel drugs and help during treatment monitoring.","Multi-scale modeling of glioma for the prediction of treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation",10184938,R01CA260271,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Repair Enzymes', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Link', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer site', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data framework', 'data fusion', 'digital pathology', 'epigenetic silencing', 'follow-up', 'genome sequencing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'methylation pattern', 'molecular imaging', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'multiscale data', 'mutational status', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'pathology imaging', 'patient biomarkers', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'recruit', 'response', 'survival outcome', 'survival prediction', 'synergism', 'temozolomide', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,612041
"Novel Radiomics for Predicting Response to Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer ABSTRACT: In 2019, an estimated 228,150 patients in the US are expected to be diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A recent landmark development has been the approval of the immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1) for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC. These immunotherapy (IO) drugs have an excellent toxicity profile and have the potential to induce durable clinically meaningful responses. However, only 1 in 5 NSCLC patients treated with IO will have a favorable response. Unfortunately, the current tissue based biomarker approach to selecting patients for these treatments is sub- optimal due to the dynamic nature of the interaction of the immune system with the tumor. Given the prohibitive costs associated with IO (>$200K/year per patient), there is a critical unmet need for predictive biomarkers to identify which patients will not benefit from IO. Additionally, the current clinical standard to evaluating tumor response (i.e. RECIST and irRC which evaluate change in tumor size and nodule disappearance) is sub-optimal in evaluating early clinical benefit from IO drugs. This is due at least in part to the fact that some patients undergoing IO present apparent disease progression (pseudo-progression) on post-treatment CT scans.  Unlike the standard canon of radiomics (computer extracted features from radiographic scans) that assess textural or shape patterns, our group has been developing novel computer vision strategies to capture patterns of peri-tumoral heterogeneity (outside the tumor) and tumor vasculature from CT scans. In N>300 patients, our group has shown that (1) radiomics of vessel tortuosity on baseline, pre-treatment CT for NSCLC patients undergoing IO were significantly different between responders (less tortuous) and non-responders (more tortuous), (2) serial changes in these measurements were better predictors of early response to IO compared to clinical response criteria such as RECIST and irRC and (3) these radiomic attributes were associated with PD-L1 expression and degree of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes on baseline biopsies. Critically, these radiomic features predicted response for NSCLC patients treated with 3 different IO agents from 3 sites.  In this project we will further develop vasculature, peri- and intra-tumoral radiomic features for monitoring and predicting benefit and early response for NSCLC patients treated with IO. We will uniquely train our radiomics using a set of N>180 resected NSCLC patients treated with first line IO and for whom we will have major pathologic response (MPR) as primary endpoint. In addition, we will establish the biological underpinnings of these predictive radiomic signatures by evaluating their association with the morphology, immune landscape (from biopsies) and molecular pathways of the tumor. In addition we have access to N>700 NSCLC patients treated on completed clinical trials via our industry partners (Astrazeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb) for tool validation. Finally, we will deploy LunIOTx within the ECOG-5163 (INSIGNA) trial (N>600), the first time that radiomics will be evaluated within a prospective cooperative group clinical trial for IO. RELEVANCE: Only 1 in 5 lung cancer patients treated with immunotherapy (IO) has a favorable response. Additionally, the cost of IO is extremely high, >$200K/year per patient. The goal of this project is to develop novel computational radiomic tools which in conjunction with routine CT scans from IO clinical trials will allow for (1) identifying pre-IO therapy as to which non-small cell lung cancer patients could potentially benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors and (2) quantitatively monitor serial changes in tumor heterogeneity during IO treatment for early identification of responders and non-responders.",Novel Radiomics for Predicting Response to Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer,10233147,R01CA257612,"['Adoption', 'Aftercare', 'Antitumor Response', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inflammatory', 'Institution', 'Letters', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nivolumab', 'Nodule', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Outcome', 'PD-1/PD-L1', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Resected', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anti-PD-1', 'anti-PD-1/PD-L1', 'anti-PD-L1 therapy', 'base', 'cost', 'imaging biomarker', 'immunotherapy clinical trials', 'immunotherapy trials', 'industry partner', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'phase III trial', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic', 'prognostic of survival', 'prognostic value', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'success', 'survival outcome', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,619994
"Integrative single cell analyses of inflammation-derived circulating hybrid cells to identify aggressive disease PROJECT SUMMARY The lifetime risk for acquiring colorectal cancer (CRC) is 7%, with an astounding rate of disease recurrence in 32% of newly diagnosed patients after their “successful” treatment. Patient with recurrent disease have a dismal 14.3% five-year survival. Lack of effective biomarkers hampers early detection of pre-metastatic disease, impacting overall survival from CRC. We identified a promising disseminated tumor cell—a product of macrophage (MФ) and cancer cell fusion—that harbors genotypic and phenotypic features of both cells of origin. Detectable along the metastatic cascade, hybrid cells can initiate tumor growth, migrate in response to MФ receptor-ligand chemotaxis, and seed metastatic sites. In peripheral blood, hybrids, named circulating hybrid cells (CHCs) outnumber conventionally defined circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in CRC patients, overcoming the sensitivity of CTC—a primary barrier—to usage as a biomarker for disease. CHCs are phenotypically diverse and reflect protein expression of the primary tumor. Based on these exciting findings, we propose that hybrid cells subpopulations harbor discrete phenotypes of pre-metastatic cells that can be identified and defined using single cell image-based phenotyping through multiplexed imaging and multimodal integration with –omics. To this end, we will analyze CHCs derived from early stage and metastatic tumors for image-based phenotyping with single cell gene expression. Utilizing quantitative and advanced image analytics including deep learning approach for image-based cell profiling, we will define inter/subcellular spatial features in single cells to identify new subpopulations and differentiate discrete phenotypic populations associated with metastatic signatures. In addition, the application of both imaging and genomic technologies to the same specimen independently measures highly dimensional, yet non-orthogonal, sets of cellular features. Multimodal integration of imaging and single cell data will quantify systems-level biological functions of cellular subpopulation and enhance imaging biomarker panel to gain biomarker specificity and sensitivity for validation in a discrete CRC patient cohort. Our overall goal is to develop a novel tumor biomarker, based upon CHC phenotyping and –omics analyses that can be used to provide new quantitative insights and develop machine-driven prediction with superior accuracy for identifying risk of metastases in CRC patients to ultimately impact survival. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite advances in screening, colorectal cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related death due to a high recurrence rate after initial treatment and a dismal 14.3% survival rate of patients with recurrent disease. Improving survival from colorectal cancer requires the ability to develop effective biomarkers for early detection of recurrent/pre-metastatic disease.

"Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and aggressive malignant adult brain tumor, with grim prognosis and heterogeneous molecular and imaging profiles. Although the currently applicable treatment options (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) have expanded during the last 20 years, there is no substantial improvement in the OS rates. The major obstacle in treating GBM patients is the heterogeneity of their molecular landscape. Determination of molecular targets requires ex vivo postoperative tissue analyses, which are limited in assessing the tumor's spatial heterogeneity (sampling error due to single sample histopathological and molecular analysis) and temporal heterogeneity (not possible to continuously assess the molecular transformation of the tumor during treatment). Herein we propose to develop quantitative imaging phenomic (QIP) markers of a range of mutations of interest in GB. We will build on prior work on EGFR, IDH1 mutations and MGMT methylation QIP signatures, and develop an extensive panel of imaging signatures of 10 gene mutations, as well as MGMT promoter methylation, using machine learning methods applied to relatively routine clinical mpMRI (standard plus diffusion tensor and perfusion protocols). Availability of such biomarkers can contribute to non-invasive i) patient stratification into appropriate treatments, ii) measurement of individual molecular characteristics. In particular, we propose to carry out the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (SA1): To develop the enabling methodologies for constructing Quantitative Imaging Phenomic signatures of GB mutations Specific Aim 2 (SA2): Establish QIP signatures of 10 mutations of interest in gliomas, plus MGMT promoter status, using next generation sequencing (NGS). We will use 709 datasets. Specific Aim 3 (SA3): Characterize the molecular heterogeneity of GB using QIP signatures, leveraging the NGS samples of SA1, as well as a new sample that we will genotype, adding to a total of 600 tumor samples obtained from 4 different locations per patient from 150 patients. The first 150 tissue samples are already analyzed as part of ongoing work. Specific Aim 4 (SA4): Integrate our methods into the Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk), in order to allow easy access to them by users This project will investigate the relationship between imaging characteristics of glioblastoma and its underlying genetic mutations/variants. As such, it aims to develop a number of imaging signatures of mutations that are important in GBM, using 1,159 (709 patients plus an additional 450 tissue samples of 150 of these patients obtained from different locations in the tumor) analyzed via next generation sequencing. The primary motivation of this work is to develop the imaging analytics methodologies and associated biomarkers that will allow us to evaluate the spatial, temporal and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastoma, thereby assisting in patient stratification and treatment.",Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning,10067573,R01NS042645,"['Adult', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Ligand Binding', 'Location', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Postoperative Period', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiogenomics', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'genetic signature', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'molecular imaging', 'next generation sequencing', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'phenomics', 'predictive signature', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'receptor', 'routine imaging', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,642578
