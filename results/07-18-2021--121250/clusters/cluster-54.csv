"Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and structure-based design of drugs for treatment, rely on experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins and other macromolecules complexed with small molecule ligands. Many of these structures have direct relevance to public health, especially complexes of drug targets with drugs, inhibitors, substrates, or allosteric effectors. Yet, structure-based drug discovery is severely complicated and hindered by experimental bias and the shortcomings of current methods of experimental ligand identification, which often result in misidentified, missing, or misplaced ligands. The propagation of erroneous structures combined with an increased accessibility to structural data not only thwarts reproducibility in biomedical research and drug discovery, but also diverts valuable resources down doomed research avenues. We will leverage our extensive experience validating and refining ligand binding sites to generate ligand reference libraries that will be made publically available on a new web resource dedicated to the interaction of small molecules and macromolecules. These libraries can be used in many downstream applications, such as drug design, computational chemistry, biology, and bioinformatics. We will utilize recent technological advances in machine learning in conjunction with existing tools to create a standardized protocol for density interpretation and unbiased, reproducible ligand identification. This pipeline will not only be able identify and model ligands in unassigned density fragments, but also be able to detect and correct suboptimally refined ligands in existing structures. As the proposed AI will be free from cognitive bias, it should alleviate the most severe problems in structure-based drug design. Because improperly interpreted structures can have a significant deleterious ripple effect, we will experimentally verify select biomedically important structures with dubious experimental support for critical small molecules using use X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. This proposal addresses current shortcomings of ligand identification in experimentally determined structures through a combination of novel machine learning algorithms and existing validation mechanisms. The main deliverables are 1) curated libraries of validated ligand binding sites and the tools used to produce the libraries and 2) a machine learning assisted pipeline for the interpretation of density fragments corresponding to small molecules within macromolecular structures. Some biologically important ligand binding sites with ambiguous, incomplete, or no experimental data will be experimentally verified using X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy.","Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries",9715158,R01GM132595,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Intuition', 'Ions', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nucleic Acid Binding', 'Ontology', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'density', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'online resource', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2019,581271,0.051034564082979565
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is entitled “Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning.” A number of in- terrelated computational methods for making predictions about the biological behavior of small molecules have been the subject of development within the Jain Laboratory for over twenty years. These share a common strat- egy that considers molecular interactions at their surface interface, where proteins and ligands actually interact. These methods yield measurements of similarity between small molecules or between protein binding pockets. They also yield measurements of the complementarity of a small molecule to a protein binding site (the molecular docking problem). A generalization of these concepts makes possible the construction of a virtual binding site for quantitative activity prediction purely from data about the biological activities of a set of small molecules.  The goals of the proposed work include further improving the accuracy and breadth of applicability of the binding site modeling approach. The primary application of the approach is to guide optimization of leads within medicinal chemistry projects, and to quantify potential off-target effects during pre-clinical drug discovery.  A critical focus of the work will be in data and software dissemination, in order to accelerate the efficient development of targeted therapies. In addition to methods development, the proposed work will involve broad application of these state-of-the-art predictive modeling methods. The proposed work will proceed with the col- laborative input of our pharmaceutical industry colleagues, who have specialized knowledge and data sets that are vital for cutting-edge work in computer-aided drug design.  The expected results include more efficient lead optimization (fewer compounds to reach desired biological pa- rameters), truly effective scaffold replacement (to move away from a molecular series with biological limitations), and improved computational predictions of off-target effects during pre-clinical drug design. Project Narrative This project seeks to refine an integrated platform for physically realistic prediction of ligand binding affinities using multiple methods that span small molecule molecular similarity, molecular docking, and protein binding site similarity. These tools will provide predictive modeling unrestrained by scaffold congruence between what is known and what is to be predicted. Prediction of bioactive molecular poses and activities to guide lead optimiza- tion and to quantify off-target liability effects are applications of the effort, and data and software will be made widely available to academic and industrial research groups.",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,9670817,R01GM101689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Electrostatics', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Industrialization', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Series', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'interest', 'lead optimization', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'protein structure', 'scaffold', 'segregation', 'small molecule', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment fees', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,310202,0.0961866278171613
"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites. The development of new computational methods in combination with generation of experimental binding data will reveal the protein- family specific use of readout modes at atomic, molecular, and cellular scales.",Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding,9626789,R35GM130376,"['Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobicity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Major Groove', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleosomes', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cofactor', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'experimental study', 'functional group', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R35,2019,562362,0.2077029756350687
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9597237,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web server', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2019,343124,0.21727668186427618
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9627995,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,393339,0.17343092939220825
"Development of a pipeline tool to predict immunogenicity of cancer neo-epitopes PROJECT SUMMARY  Epitope-based cancer immunotherapies have been intensely investigated for decades, but have thus far met with mixed results in the clinical setting. Recent years have, however, witnessed a resurgence of interest based on advances in high-throughput sequencing approaches that allow rapid identification of cancer- associated, patient-specific mutations having the potential of being recognized as epitopes (neo-epitopes).  Previous studies defined binding affinity associated with immunogenicity for HLA class I MHC restricted CTL responses of viral and non-self origin. However, it is not clear if the same threshold is applicable to identify epitopes in self-antigens, such as the ones recognized in autoimmunity and cancer. Additional factors expected to play a crucial role in the immunogenicity of cancer neo-epitopes include the propensity of epitopes to be derived by natural processing, and subsequent capacity of being recognized by TCR. While several online tools are available for predicting processing and TCR recognition, the relative role of each of these factors (HLA binding, processing, TCR recognition) has not been analyzed in the cancer setting. Likewise, how the different online tools can be optimally combined to predict neo-epitopes has not been thoroughly addressed.  Accordingly, our study will experimentally establish the threshold for HLA binding affinity of neo- epitopes, validate the suitability of HLA binding prediction methods in a cancer setting, and establish whether predicted binding affinities can be suitably used in lieu of experimentally measured binding constants. We will also evaluate the predictive value of additional variables globally affecting neo-epitope immunogenicity, including allele-specific HLA binding thresholds, HLA-peptide binding stability, binding capacity of the somatic sequence from which a neo-epitope is derived, the predictive capacity of TAP and proteosomal cleavage algorithms and, to account for neo-epitope TCR interface effects, we will evaluate two alternative schemes based on analysis of the residue type occupying putative TCR contact positions. Finally, we will explore combining all neo-epitope immunogenicity predictors into a single pipeline and provide experimental validation of its predictive efficacy.  The proposed research will provide 1) the first in-depth characterization of the relative importance of different variables affecting neo-epitope immunogenicity, 2) the first integration of predictive tools for each of these variables into a single pipeline, and 3) freely available online access of a newly developed pipeline to the scientific community. This is highly innovative, since no such resource is currently available for epitope immunogenicity in general, and for cancer neo-epitopes in particular. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is intended to provide in-depth characterization of the importance of several variables affecting cancer neo-epitope immunogenicity. These findings in turn will allow the development of bioinformatic tools, and a unified analysis pipeline, towards the identification of cancer neo-epitopes. Identification of such epitopes is expected to allow quick identification of cancer-associated, patient-specific, mutations potentially recognized as epitopes, with direct applicability to the development of efficacious therapeutics.",Development of a pipeline tool to predict immunogenicity of cancer neo-epitopes,9703890,R21AI134127,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigens', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Literature', 'MHC Class I Genes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Scheme', 'Side', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Therapeutic', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Weight', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'experimental study', 'immune activation', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neoantigens', 'peripheral tolerance', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIAID,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R21,2019,225000,0.04966149728732188
"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods. TNF receptors are the common drug targets for autoimmune diseases. Understand their cellular mechanism of binding therefore is highly relevant to public health.",Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces,9746739,R01GM122804,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Avidity', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fibrinogen', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Homo', 'Host Defense', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune System', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutate', 'N-terminal', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'injured', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large-scale database', 'method development', 'multi-scale modeling', 'pathogen', 'physical process', 'protein complex', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'recruit', 'simulation', 'tumor necrosis factor receptor binding']",NIGMS,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,327738,0.16819906268993806
"Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins Project Summary Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to the precision treatment of disease. When high resolution structures of a protein are available, and many isoforms of the protein have been connected to dif- fering binding preferences, it is possible in principle to model the structures of all isoforms and discover the mechanisms that cause variations in binding preferences. Unfortunately, this discovery process depends on human expertise for examining molecular structure, and given that hundreds of isoforms may exist, a human would be overwhelmed to objectively examine many similar isoforms. To fill this gap, this project will (A1) de- velop software that identifies structural mechanisms that cause differential binding preferences, categorizes similar structural mechanisms, and explains the mechanisms in English. The second aim of this project (A2) is to validate the software at a large scale on families of proteins that exhibit a variety of well-examined binding preferences, and through blind predictions with experimental collaborators. Our approach involves creating software that mimics the visual reasoning techniques employed by structural biologists when examining molecular structures. Not only are these techniques responsible for most major dis- coveries in structural biology, but they are also straightforward to understand by non-computational research- ers. This property will enable our software to immediately integrate into existing workflows at labs that do not focus on computational methods. This property also contrasts from existing methods, which generally output structural models, potential energies, p-values and structural scores which are difficult for non-experts to un- derstand or incorporate into their research. Often, an expert in biophysics is required to interpret the outputs so that they can be operationalized in laboratory environments. In preliminary results, our methods have already identified molecular mechanisms that govern specificity in several families of proteins. Verification against peer-reviewed experimentation has proven the preliminary results correct in almost all cases. Our methods have also been applied to make a blind prediction of binding mechanisms in the ricin toxin, which binds to and damages the human ribosome. With experimental collabo- rators, we showed that our methods correctly identified and predicted the roles of several amino acids with a hitherto unknown role in recognizing the ribosome. Using our methodological approach and our rigorous valida- tion strategy, this project will produce a highly validated, usable software package that will bridge a critical gap in the development of precision therapies and diagnostics. Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to precision medicine and precise diagnostics. We will develop software that will identify and categorize molecular mechanisms that cause these variations. The resulting insights will enable clinicians to more precisely select therapies to achieve superior outcomes.",Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins,9740715,R01GM123131,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'HIV Protease', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobicity', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Nicotinic Receptors', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Population', 'Potential Energy', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Ricin', 'Role', 'Serine Protease', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxin', 'Tweens', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'base', 'blind', 'human-in-the-loop', 'hydropathy', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'mutant', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'preference', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'simulation', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIGMS,LEHIGH UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,244161,0.0785167269501191
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously.

"Probing transcriptional activation at the molecular level Project abstract Much of the assembly process of the transcription machinery is governed by transient and dynamic protein‐ protein interactions (PPIs) that defy standard characterization strategies. Transcriptional coactivators are the hubs of this process, interacting with transcriptional activators, epigenetic modulators, the polymerase, and other coactivators to assemble the transcriptional machine. Coactivators also represent a central molecular recognition conundrum, as the mechanisms by which they interact with such a diverse array with binding partners and the influence of local binding interactions on longer‐range structural and functional trajectories. In the previous funding period, we developed a molecular recognition model that addresses the first part of the conundrum. Here will build on this model to discover allosteric modulators of coactivators previously labelled undruggable despite their central functional roles. Additionally, we will answer the latter half of the conundrum to develop a comprehensive model of molecular recognition in transcriptional coactivator function. Project narrative Transcription is dysregulated in every human disease as either a cause or an effect and as such represents a potentially powerful intervention point for therapeutics; a significant impediment to progress are the many questions regarding the complex network of protein‐protein interactions that regulates this process. In this research plan we implement a combination of chemical biology tools and approaches to define key binding interactions and conformational changes that produce function in vitro and in cells.

"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9667439,R01GM051946,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Body Patterning', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Formation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Repression', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'bZIP Protein', 'base', 'cofactor', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'loss of function mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'morphogens', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'single molecule', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,362238,0.10185355028394795
"Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines Peptides bound to class I HLA molecules (HLA-A, -B and –C) arise from endogenous or foreign proteins that are cleaved by the proteasome and peptidases of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to loading and display by surface HLA class I proteins. Each HLA allele is estimated to bind and present ~1,000-10,000 unique peptides to T cells. Given such diversity in HLA binding, an important question is whether we can predict whether a particular peptide is likely to bind to a specific HLA allele. Indeed, peptide-binding rules have been long-studied extensively for a subset of HLA alleles and encoded in advanced neural network-based algorithms that predict binding. Historically, little attention has been paid to HLA-C because of its perceived lower surface expression and hence predictive algorithms of HLA-C are very much lacking, as only a few thousand peptides epitopes have been reported in databases. New studies, however, suggests that important epitopes can arise from HLA-C, and have been detected for HIV, EBV, CMV and influenza. Our hypothesis is that large-scale datasets of endogenous HLA bound peptides can improve prediction of binding, and that through applying such an approach to HLA-C, a substantial increase in numbers of actionable immunogenic targets on tumor cells can be gained. Recently, I spearheaded a successful effort to integrate my expertise in experimental workflows for the isolation of HLA-bound peptides with newly available innovations in analysis and instrumentation for mass spectrometry (MS) to create a high throughput MS-based approach for the physical detection of peptides directly displayed by HLA molecules. This workflow and analytic framework now provides an exciting opportunity to generate high-quality data to directly address these challenges. In Aim 1, to systematically identify HLA-C binding peptides, we will use MS to provide experimentally-derived datasets of peptides from 21 HLA-C alleles to provide 99.9% global population coverage. In Aim 2, to define the rules of processing and presentation across HLA-C de novo, we will discover the binding motifs of the HLA-C peptides and use this information to develop predictive algorithms, which we will validate using independent datasets. In Aim 3, we seek to determine if predicted tumor neoepitopes are physically detected on patient tumor cells. We will perform experimental validation of HLA-C prediction algorithms directly on tumor samples available from study subjects enrolled on high-priority clinical trials of personalized neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines at DFCI using a new nano-scale MS-based analysis. We will confirm the immunogenicity of the detected HLA-C epitopes through in vitro T cell assays using banked peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from study subjects. We anticipate the proposed studies to enable fuller understanding HLA-C epitope presentation, more robust prediction of HLA-C peptide epitopes, and expansion of the spectrum of actionable immune targets. Immune recognition of short peptides representative of proteins within a cell in conjunction with a group of surface molecules called HLA is essential for the process of immune reactivity but characterization of the properties of how these peptides bind to HLA molecules has been constrained by the limited available information about these peptides. We have developed a new high-throughput approach to rapidly isolate thousands of HLA-bound peptides directly from informative cell lines and tumor samples (from patients with melanoma, glioblastoma and renal cell cancer) and to use this information to develop novel algorithms to predict binding of peptides to HLA. We anticipate the proposed studies t o enable fuller understanding of how a subset of understudied HLA molecules (i.e. HLA-C) interact with their binding peptides, to improve prediction of HLA-C bound peptides, and to expand the spectrum of actionable immune targets.",Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines,9625817,R21CA216772,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'C-Peptide', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Glioblastoma', 'HIV', 'HLA-A gene', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Influenza', 'Letters', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specimen', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nanoscale', 'neoantigen vaccine', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'polypeptide C', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vaccine trial']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2019,187702,0.06463518146155331
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is entitled “Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning.” A number of in- terrelated computational methods for making predictions about the biological behavior of small molecules have been the subject of development within the Jain Laboratory for over twenty years. These share a common strat- egy that considers molecular interactions at their surface interface, where proteins and ligands actually interact. These methods yield measurements of similarity between small molecules or between protein binding pockets. They also yield measurements of the complementarity of a small molecule to a protein binding site (the molecular docking problem). A generalization of these concepts makes possible the construction of a virtual binding site for quantitative activity prediction purely from data about the biological activities of a set of small molecules.  The goals of the proposed work include further improving the accuracy and breadth of applicability of the binding site modeling approach. The primary application of the approach is to guide optimization of leads within medicinal chemistry projects, and to quantify potential off-target effects during pre-clinical drug discovery.  A critical focus of the work will be in data and software dissemination, in order to accelerate the efficient development of targeted therapies. In addition to methods development, the proposed work will involve broad application of these state-of-the-art predictive modeling methods. The proposed work will proceed with the col- laborative input of our pharmaceutical industry colleagues, who have specialized knowledge and data sets that are vital for cutting-edge work in computer-aided drug design.  The expected results include more efficient lead optimization (fewer compounds to reach desired biological pa- rameters), truly effective scaffold replacement (to move away from a molecular series with biological limitations), and improved computational predictions of off-target effects during pre-clinical drug design. Project Narrative This project seeks to refine an integrated platform for physically realistic prediction of ligand binding affinities using multiple methods that span small molecule molecular similarity, molecular docking, and protein binding site similarity. These tools will provide predictive modeling unrestrained by scaffold congruence between what is known and what is to be predicted. Prediction of bioactive molecular poses and activities to guide lead optimiza- tion and to quantify off-target liability effects are applications of the effort, and data and software will be made widely available to academic and industrial research groups.",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,9454479,R01GM101689,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Electrostatics', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Industrialization', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Series', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'interest', 'lead optimization', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'scaffold', 'segregation', 'small molecule', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment fees', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,310202,0.0961866278171613
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9382895,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2018,329119,0.21727668186427618

"Development of a pipeline tool to predict immunogenicity of cancer neo-epitopes PROJECT SUMMARY  Epitope-based cancer immunotherapies have been intensely investigated for decades, but have thus far met with mixed results in the clinical setting. Recent years have, however, witnessed a resurgence of interest based on advances in high-throughput sequencing approaches that allow rapid identification of cancer- associated, patient-specific mutations having the potential of being recognized as epitopes (neo-epitopes).  Previous studies defined binding affinity associated with immunogenicity for HLA class I MHC restricted CTL responses of viral and non-self origin. However, it is not clear if the same threshold is applicable to identify epitopes in self-antigens, such as the ones recognized in autoimmunity and cancer. Additional factors expected to play a crucial role in the immunogenicity of cancer neo-epitopes include the propensity of epitopes to be derived by natural processing, and subsequent capacity of being recognized by TCR. While several online tools are available for predicting processing and TCR recognition, the relative role of each of these factors (HLA binding, processing, TCR recognition) has not been analyzed in the cancer setting. Likewise, how the different online tools can be optimally combined to predict neo-epitopes has not been thoroughly addressed.  Accordingly, our study will experimentally establish the threshold for HLA binding affinity of neo- epitopes, validate the suitability of HLA binding prediction methods in a cancer setting, and establish whether predicted binding affinities can be suitably used in lieu of experimentally measured binding constants. We will also evaluate the predictive value of additional variables globally affecting neo-epitope immunogenicity, including allele-specific HLA binding thresholds, HLA-peptide binding stability, binding capacity of the somatic sequence from which a neo-epitope is derived, the predictive capacity of TAP and proteosomal cleavage algorithms and, to account for neo-epitope TCR interface effects, we will evaluate two alternative schemes based on analysis of the residue type occupying putative TCR contact positions. Finally, we will explore combining all neo-epitope immunogenicity predictors into a single pipeline and provide experimental validation of its predictive efficacy.  The proposed research will provide 1) the first in-depth characterization of the relative importance of different variables affecting neo-epitope immunogenicity, 2) the first integration of predictive tools for each of these variables into a single pipeline, and 3) freely available online access of a newly developed pipeline to the scientific community. This is highly innovative, since no such resource is currently available for epitope immunogenicity in general, and for cancer neo-epitopes in particular. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is intended to provide in-depth characterization of the importance of several variables affecting cancer neo-epitope immunogenicity. These findings in turn will allow the development of bioinformatic tools, and a unified analysis pipeline, towards the identification of cancer neo-epitopes. Identification of such epitopes is expected to allow quick identification of cancer-associated, patient-specific, mutations potentially recognized as epitopes, with direct applicability to the development of efficacious therapeutics.",Development of a pipeline tool to predict immunogenicity of cancer neo-epitopes,9405144,R21AI134127,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigens', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Literature', 'MHC Class I Genes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Side', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Therapeutic', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Weight', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'experimental study', 'immune activation', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neoantigens', 'peripheral tolerance', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIAID,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R21,2018,270000,0.04966149728732188
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors.

"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells. Control of cell states, such as in maintenance of pluripotency by stem cells or differentiation into defined cell lineages, holds promise for regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. These cell fate programs are initiated by `pioneer factors' that recognize their genomic target sites and induce hierarchies of gene regulatory programs. We will identify human pioneer factors and characterize their regulatory interactions.",Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA,9550852,R21HG009268,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Property', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer stem cell', 'cell type', 'ds-DNA', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'recruit', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,266250,0.15673776843374243
"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9450518,R01GM051946,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Body Patterning', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Formation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Repression', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'bZIP Protein', 'base', 'cofactor', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'loss of function mutation', 'morphogens', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'single molecule', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,362333,0.10185355028394795
"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods. TNF receptors are the common drug targets for autoimmune diseases. Understand their cellular mechanism of binding therefore is highly relevant to public health.",Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces,9567985,R01GM122804,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Avidity', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fibrinogen', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Homo', 'Host Defense', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune System', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutate', 'N-terminal', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'injured', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large-scale database', 'method development', 'multi-scale modeling', 'pathogen', 'physical process', 'protein complex', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'recruit', 'simulation', 'tumor necrosis factor receptor binding']",NIGMS,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,142621,0.16819906268993806
"Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines Peptides bound to class I HLA molecules (HLA-A, -B and –C) arise from endogenous or foreign proteins that are cleaved by the proteasome and peptidases of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to loading and display by surface HLA class I proteins. Each HLA allele is estimated to bind and present ~1,000-10,000 unique peptides to T cells. Given such diversity in HLA binding, an important question is whether we can predict whether a particular peptide is likely to bind to a specific HLA allele. Indeed, peptide-binding rules have been long-studied extensively for a subset of HLA alleles and encoded in advanced neural network-based algorithms that predict binding. Historically, little attention has been paid to HLA-C because of its perceived lower surface expression and hence predictive algorithms of HLA-C are very much lacking, as only a few thousand peptides epitopes have been reported in databases. New studies, however, suggests that important epitopes can arise from HLA-C, and have been detected for HIV, EBV, CMV and influenza. Our hypothesis is that large-scale datasets of endogenous HLA bound peptides can improve prediction of binding, and that through applying such an approach to HLA-C, a substantial increase in numbers of actionable immunogenic targets on tumor cells can be gained. Recently, I spearheaded a successful effort to integrate my expertise in experimental workflows for the isolation of HLA-bound peptides with newly available innovations in analysis and instrumentation for mass spectrometry (MS) to create a high throughput MS-based approach for the physical detection of peptides directly displayed by HLA molecules. This workflow and analytic framework now provides an exciting opportunity to generate high-quality data to directly address these challenges. In Aim 1, to systematically identify HLA-C binding peptides, we will use MS to provide experimentally-derived datasets of peptides from 21 HLA-C alleles to provide 99.9% global population coverage. In Aim 2, to define the rules of processing and presentation across HLA-C de novo, we will discover the binding motifs of the HLA-C peptides and use this information to develop predictive algorithms, which we will validate using independent datasets. In Aim 3, we seek to determine if predicted tumor neoepitopes are physically detected on patient tumor cells. We will perform experimental validation of HLA-C prediction algorithms directly on tumor samples available from study subjects enrolled on high-priority clinical trials of personalized neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines at DFCI using a new nano-scale MS-based analysis. We will confirm the immunogenicity of the detected HLA-C epitopes through in vitro T cell assays using banked peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from study subjects. We anticipate the proposed studies to enable fuller understanding HLA-C epitope presentation, more robust prediction of HLA-C peptide epitopes, and expansion of the spectrum of actionable immune targets. Immune recognition of short peptides representative of proteins within a cell in conjunction with a group of surface molecules called HLA is essential for the process of immune reactivity but characterization of the properties of how these peptides bind to HLA molecules has been constrained by the limited available information about these peptides. We have developed a new high-throughput approach to rapidly isolate thousands of HLA-bound peptides directly from informative cell lines and tumor samples (from patients with melanoma, glioblastoma and renal cell cancer) and to use this information to develop novel algorithms to predict binding of peptides to HLA. We anticipate the proposed studies t o enable fuller understanding of how a subset of understudied HLA molecules (i.e. HLA-C) interact with their binding peptides, to improve prediction of HLA-C bound peptides, and to expand the spectrum of actionable immune targets.",Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines,9456316,R21CA216772,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'C-Peptide', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Glioblastoma', 'HIV', 'HLA-A gene', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Influenza', 'Letters', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specimen', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'melanoma', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nanoscale', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation', 'novel', 'polypeptide C', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vaccine trial']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2018,232224,0.06463518146155331
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is entitled “Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning.” A number of in- terrelated computational methods for making predictions about the biological behavior of small molecules have been the subject of development within the Jain Laboratory for over twenty years. These share a common strat- egy that considers molecular interactions at their surface interface, where proteins and ligands actually interact. These methods yield measurements of similarity between small molecules or between protein binding pockets. They also yield measurements of the complementarity of a small molecule to a protein binding site (the molecular docking problem). A generalization of these concepts makes possible the construction of a virtual binding site for quantitative activity prediction purely from data about the biological activities of a set of small molecules.  The goals of the proposed work include further improving the accuracy and breadth of applicability of the binding site modeling approach. The primary application of the approach is to guide optimization of leads within medicinal chemistry projects, and to quantify potential off-target effects during pre-clinical drug discovery.  A critical focus of the work will be in data and software dissemination, in order to accelerate the efficient development of targeted therapies. In addition to methods development, the proposed work will involve broad application of these state-of-the-art predictive modeling methods. The proposed work will proceed with the col- laborative input of our pharmaceutical industry colleagues, who have specialized knowledge and data sets that are vital for cutting-edge work in computer-aided drug design.  The expected results include more efficient lead optimization (fewer compounds to reach desired biological pa- rameters), truly effective scaffold replacement (to move away from a molecular series with biological limitations), and improved computational predictions of off-target effects during pre-clinical drug design. Project Narrative This project seeks to refine an integrated platform for physically realistic prediction of ligand binding affinities using multiple methods that span small molecule molecular similarity, molecular docking, and protein binding site similarity. These tools will provide predictive modeling unrestrained by scaffold congruence between what is known and what is to be predicted. Prediction of bioactive molecular poses and activities to guide lead optimiza- tion and to quantify off-target liability effects are applications of the effort, and data and software will be made widely available to academic and industrial research groups.",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,9309936,R01GM101689,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Electrostatics', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Industrialization', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Series', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'scaffold', 'segregation', 'small molecule', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment fees', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2017,310202,0.0961866278171613
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9233159,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2017,329119,0.21727668186427618
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9237919,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,410714,0.17343092939220825
"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells.

"Administrative Supplement: Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells.

"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs).

"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods. TNF receptors are the common drug targets for autoimmune diseases. Understand their cellular mechanism of binding therefore is highly relevant to public health.",Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces,9285277,R01GM122804,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Avidity', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Fibrinogen', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Homo', 'Host Defense', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune System', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutate', 'N-terminal', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'injured', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large-scale database', 'method development', 'multi-scale modeling', 'pathogen', 'physical process', 'protein complex', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'simulation', 'tumor necrosis factor receptor binding']",NIGMS,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2017,327738,0.16819906268993806
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9008644,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Systems', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'abstracting', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2016,343124,0.21727668186427618

"An Integrative Approach to Construct a Regulatory Network Effected by TDZs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic disorders. Obesit typically leads to accumulation of dysfunctional white adipose tissue (WAT), which further causes metabolic dysregulation with elevated circulation of fatty acids and increased secretion of proinflammatory adipokines. The discovery of fat burning brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has raised the exciting possibility of BAT may be targeted as a novel method to treat obesity and metablic diseases. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have a function to convert WAT into a ""brownlike"" state. Beside, TZDs have been used as a remedy for diabetes. But the clinical use of TZDs has been limited because of the safety concerns such as potential cardiovascular risks. Understanding the mechanism will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders. TZDs act by activatin PPAR? (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ?). However, our understanding about the targets f PPAR? and other cofactors is limited. To understand the role of TZDs and further study the browning effect, we propose to develop a novel algorithm to predict long-range promoter-enhancer interaction and construct a transcriptional network. To predict the long-range interactions, we will employ a machine learning algorithm that uses the enhancer RNA (eRNA) levels and gene transcription levels obtained from global run-on sequencing (GROseq) data. GROseq is a useful dataset to predict long-range interactions, as the eRNA levels highly correlate with the gene transcription level. Applyingthe obtained interactions to the known binding sites of TFs including PPAR?, GR, C/EBP, SMRT, and RXR, we will construct a comprehensive TF-gene network. The predicted interaction provides a useful environment to study gene regulation of TZDs. We will study how the distance, relative position, an the combination of multiple TF binding sites affect gene expression. We will also investigate the browning effects by TZDs by including BAT-specific TF binding data in the network. The transcriptioal rule of the BAT-specific binding information, in combination with other TFs, will be analyzed from he TF-gene network. As a whole, these studies use an innovative and creative approach to integrate various types of data to study gene regulation of TZDs. By reprocessing complex genomic datasets ino a comprehensive regulatory network, the proposed algorithm provides a unique view in analyzing the regulatory rules of the browning effect, which will greatly enhance our understanding about the gen regulation of TZDs and identify potential therapeutic targets for diabetes.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A noble algorithm is developed to reprocess and integrate various types of data in a regulatory network to the study of the browning effect by thiazolidinedione (TZD). We will develop a novel algorithm to predict promoter-enhancer long-range interactions using the glbal run-on sequencing (GROseq) data and construct regulatory network using the known transcription factor binding sites. The analysis using the TF-gene networks will elucidate the transcriptional regulations of TZDs, which will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders.            ",An Integrative Approach to Construct a Regulatory Network Effected by TDZs,8640941,R21DK098769,"['2,4-thiazolidinedione', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brown Fat', 'Burn injury', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Calories', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Heating', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Obesity', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention approach', 'Property', 'RNA', 'RXR', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Time', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'adipokines', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cofactor', 'design', 'epigenome', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insulin sensitivity', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2014,200000,0.040365190274705184
"Molecular Mechanisms of Telomere Length Homeostasis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Telomere integrity is essential for cell survival and proliferation. Accordingly, dysfunctional telomeres can initiate genomic instability, cellular senescence, and organismal aging. Telomere structure is provided by binding of shelterin to telomeric DNA repeats forming a nucleoprotein complex. Similar to the human shelterin, in fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, shelterin is composed of telomeric sequence-specific double-stranded and single-stranded DNA binding proteins, Taz1 and Pot1, respectively, accompanied by their protein interaction partners, Rap1, Poz1, and Tpz1, which form a ""protein bridge"" connecting Taz1 and Pot1. Shelterin protects telomere integrity as well as regulates telomerase. With the parent grant support, we biochemically identified Tpz1 mutants that can individually but specifically disrupt its interactions with Poz1, Ccq1, or Pot1. Using these separation-of-function mutants of Tpz1, we found that the complete linkage between telomere dsDNA and ssDNA binding proteins within the shelterin complex is required for defining the telomerase-nonextendible state of telomeres. Moreover, epistasis analyses revealed that Tpz1 also participates in the activation of telomeres to the extendible state via its interaction with Ccq1. Our results suggest critical regulatory roles of Tpz1 in the telomere ON/OFF binary switch. Here, we request supplemental funds to use emerging technologies and interdisciplinary teams to further advance our mechanistic understanding of shelterin to a new level.

"An integrative approach to construct a regulatory network effected by TDZs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic disorders. Obesit typically leads to accumulation of dysfunctional white adipose tissue (WAT), which further causes metabolic dysregulation with elevated circulation of fatty acids and increased secretion of proinflammatory adipokines. The discovery of fat burning brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has raised the exciting possibility of BAT may be targeted as a novel method to treat obesity and metablic diseases. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have a function to convert WAT into a ""brownlike"" state. Beside, TZDs have been used as a remedy for diabetes. But the clinical use of TZDs has been limited because of the safety concerns such as potential cardiovascular risks. Understanding the mechanism will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders. TZDs act by activatin PPAR? (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ?). However, our understanding about the targets f PPAR? and other cofactors is limited. To understand the role of TZDs and further study the browning effect, we propose to develop a novel algorithm to predict long-range promoter-enhancer interaction and construct a transcriptional network. To predict the long-range interactions, we will employ a machine learning algorithm that uses the enhancer RNA (eRNA) levels and gene transcription levels obtained from global run-on sequencing (GROseq) data. GROseq is a useful dataset to predict long-range interactions, as the eRNA levels highly correlate with the gene transcription level. Applyingthe obtained interactions to the known binding sites of TFs including PPAR?, GR, C/EBP, SMRT, and RXR, we will construct a comprehensive TF-gene network. The predicted interaction provides a useful environment to study gene regulation of TZDs. We will study how the distance, relative position, an the combination of multiple TF binding sites affect gene expression. We will also investigate the browning effects by TZDs by including BAT-specific TF binding data in the network. The transcriptioal rule of the BAT-specific binding information, in combination with other TFs, will be analyzed from he TF-gene network. As a whole, these studies use an innovative and creative approach to integrate various types of data to study gene regulation of TZDs. By reprocessing complex genomic datasets ino a comprehensive regulatory network, the proposed algorithm provides a unique view in analyzing the regulatory rules of the browning effect, which will greatly enhance our understanding about the gen regulation of TZDs and identify potential therapeutic targets for diabetes.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A noble algorithm is developed to reprocess and integrate various types of data in a regulatory network to the study of the browning effect by thiazolidinedione (TZD). We will develop a novel algorithm to predict promoter-enhancer long-range interactions using the glbal run-on sequencing (GROseq) data and construct regulatory network using the known transcription factor binding sites. The analysis using the TF-gene networks will elucidate the transcriptional regulations of TZDs, which will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders.            ",An integrative approach to construct a regulatory network effected by TDZs,8491522,R21DK098769,"['2,4-thiazolidinedione', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brown Fat', 'Burn injury', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Calories', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Heating', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Obesity', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention approach', 'Property', 'RNA', 'RXR', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Time', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'adipokines', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cofactor', 'design', 'epigenome', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insulin sensitivity', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2013,240000,0.040365190274705184

"Gene Regulation E. coli Database Integrated Modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Genomic Sciences of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca and a group of collaborators propose to further develop and enrich the RegulonDB database. RegulonDB contains the largest electronically-available regulatory network of any living organism, that of Escherichia coli K-12. In the project we will expand the design, implement computational and conceptual models, and generate annotations derived from original literature of the different components of the regulatory network. We will experimentally map promoters and transcription units under different conditions. This project expands a previous grant supporting RegulonDB. High quality manual curation is to be enriched beyond transcription initiation to include signal-transduction connecting sensing with regulation, as well as with natural language text processing tools. We propose to continue an exhaustive experimental mapping of all possible transcription initiation sites in the genome and to perform an exhaustive experimental identification of transcription units in different conditions. The core of RegulonDB (literature-based network and the graphic and browsing tools) will be linked and made accessible, as optional user selections, with high-throughput available experiments (microarrays and ChIP- chip) both as raw and pre-analyzed data, as well as with collections of computational predictions of all network elements (transcription factors, promoters, binding sites, operons, regulatory interactions). This will be based on track representations and compliant with international consortia normalized pathway exchange formats. The openness of RegulonDB data and internal structure will expand considerably, enhancing as well its availability to tools for analysis and representation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  RegulonDB is a gold standard both in its conceptual and computational design, as well as in the amount and quality of data gathered on the largest and best characterized regulatory network of a single organism. The improvements and expansion of RegulonDB may accelerate research in other bacterial models, including pathogens. RegulonDB has served as a benchmark for a variety of computational predictive tools for components of the network.

"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome. The data generated in this project will be the first systematic functional analysis of TF binding sites at base-pair resolution.              n/a",Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters,8132645,U01HG004561,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antibodies', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transfection', 'base', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'forest', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'research study', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2010,430000,0.1779963883516375

"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome.

"Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding regulatory networks controlling gene expression is one of the fundamental problems of modern biology. The proposed research focuses on the methods of locating regulatory elements in DNA. We have developed a new maximum likelihood method based on the physical DNA dependent binding probability of a transcription factor (TF) that correctly incorporates the protein concentration dependent saturation effect. The advantage of keeping the saturation effect is that the method automatically provides a score threshold for classifying candidate sites into binders and non-binders. Most conventional methods, based on the information score, merely provide a relative ordering of candidate sequences. The principled choice of a threshold is extremely useful for dealing with the highly variable sites typical of global regulatory factors. The simplest of our algorithms reduces to a one-class support vector machine. This classifier will be applied to detect large regulons in E. coli, as well as in phages, with special attention to targets of sigma factors. We also develop classifiers for regulatory targets that go beyond pure sequence analysis and combine it with information from additional sources, like microarray expression data or sequence similarity between phylogenetically closely related species. The proposed computational effort will be complemented by experiments verifying the predictions as well as providing in vitro and in vivo data needed to make predictions. Experimental efforts will involve a high throughput low stringency SELEX method applied to global transcriptional regulators from E. coli. It will also involve chromatin immunoprecipitation and beta- galactosidase assays performed in S. Cerevisiae that test the ability of bioinformatic algorithms to predict functionality of TF binding sites. A special feature of this proposal is the analysis of the effect of the rest of the promoter on the regulatory potential of a site. We apply the lessons learnt in simple organisms to the elucidation of distinctive specificity of different NFkB proteins involved in immunity, inflammation and cancer. Mutation, over-expression and amplification of genes encoding transcription factors play an important role in many diseases from diabetes to cancer. Understanding how a factor targets genes is crucial for discovering the pathways whose malfunction leads to the symptoms. This is an achievable goal, given the right way to analyze the plethora of genome-wide data available to us.           n/a",Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes,7392219,R01HG003470,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Class', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mating Types', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Protein Overexpression', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulon', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Score', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shock', 'Sigma Factor', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Galactosidase', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'combinatorial', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'programs', 'promoter', 'research study', 'response', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2008,294338,0.06457314843408682
"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development. n/a",Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures,7477279,R01LM005652,"['Active Sites', 'Algorithms', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Growth', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Seeds', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'indexing', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'size', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'technology development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'vector']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,338976,0.09940534178955888
"Protein structural disorder and ubiquitination    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Defects in the ubiquitin-proteasome system are implicated in the development of numerous human diseases. Some of the natural substrates for ubiquitination and degradation can induce malignant transformation if not properly removed from the cell. Despite the importance of the ubiquitination process, precise identification of ubiquitination (Ub) sites (i.e. acceptor lysine residues to which a ubiquitin molecule is attached) within substrates of ubiquitin ligases is still experimentally challenging. The development of computational approaches to predict Ub sites from a protein sequence provides an attractive alternative to the experimental methods. Here, we propose to develop a computational algorithm that could predict Ub sites with high precision. First, we will identify new protein Ub sites using a combination of multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPit) and mass spectrometry. Different environmental perturbations, such as heat shock, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and starvation for nutrients, will be introduced in order to increase the coverage of the ubiquitinated proteome. Second, we will use the dataset of new Ub sites to develop a ubiquitination sites predictor. A novel machine learning approach that includes co-training of two predictors having different data representations, and the usage of the unlabeled dataset to increase performance accuracy will be utilized. To our knowledge, this will be the first ubiquitination sites predictor developed to date. Finally, we will apply the predictor to the datasets of cell signaling and cancer-associated proteins to predict new ubiquitination sites and substrates among them. The prediction of intrinsic disorder (ID) will be carried out on the same datasets in order to test the hypothesis about preferential occurrence of Ub sites within ID regions. Annotated disease-related mutations will be extracted from three public databases (MutDB, SWISS-PROT and OMIM) and correlated with the predicted ubiquitination sites. The discovery of mutations in proximity to Ub sites or even those directly affecting Ub sites would lay the basis for formulating and testing biologically meaningful hypotheses about their role in cancer and other diseases. Proteins undergo a wide range of modifications that regulate their activity. One of such modification, ubiquitination, was shown to be involved in various human diseases including cancer, renal diseases (von Hippel-Lindau disease, Liddle syndrome, ischemic acute renal failure), several neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer, Parkinson, CAG- expansion disorders). The precise ubiquitination sites in proteins are difficult to detect. We propose to develop a computational approach that could identify such sites with high precision. This would help to develop better drugs that are directed either against the ubiquitinated proteins or against specific sites in these proteins.          n/a",Protein structural disorder and ubiquitination,7478711,R21CA113711,"['Acute Kidney Failure', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Generations', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Range', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Starvation', 'Structural Protein', 'SwissProt', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ubiquitin', 'Ubiquitination', 'Validation', 'Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'human disease', 'improved', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'novel', 'ubiquitin ligase']",NCI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,168000,0.038937785780923516

"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms.

"Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding regulatory networks controlling gene expression is one of the fundamental problems of modern biology. The proposed research focuses on the methods of locating regulatory elements in DNA. We have developed a new maximum likelihood method based on the physical DNA dependent binding probability of a transcription factor (TF) that correctly incorporates the protein concentration dependent saturation effect. The advantage of keeping the saturation effect is that the method automatically provides a score threshold for classifying candidate sites into binders and non-binders. Most conventional methods, based on the information score, merely provide a relative ordering of candidate sequences. The principled choice of a threshold is extremely useful for dealing with the highly variable sites typical of global regulatory factors. The simplest of our algorithms reduces to a one-class support vector machine. This classifier will be applied to detect large regulons in E. coli, as well as in phages, with special attention to targets of sigma factors. We also develop classifiers for regulatory targets that go beyond pure sequence analysis and combine it with information from additional sources, like microarray expression data or sequence similarity between phylogenetically closely related species. The proposed computational effort will be complemented by experiments verifying the predictions as well as providing in vitro and in vivo data needed to make predictions. Experimental efforts will involve a high throughput low stringency SELEX method applied to global transcriptional regulators from E. coli. It will also involve chromatin immunoprecipitation and beta- galactosidase assays performed in S. Cerevisiae that test the ability of bioinformatic algorithms to predict functionality of TF binding sites. A special feature of this proposal is the analysis of the effect of the rest of the promoter on the regulatory potential of a site. We apply the lessons learnt in simple organisms to the elucidation of distinctive specificity of different NFkB proteins involved in immunity, inflammation and cancer. Mutation, over-expression and amplification of genes encoding transcription factors play an important role in many diseases from diabetes to cancer.

"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development. n/a",Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures,7282065,R01LM005652,"['Active Sites', 'Algorithms', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Catalysis', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Growth', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Seeds', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'indexing', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'size', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'technology development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'vector']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,355458,0.09940534178955888
"2007 Small Intergin Binding Proteins Gordon Research Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Large, integrin-binding proteins such as collagens, fibronectin, and thrombospondin are integral parts of established matrices and are generally discussed at other GRC meetings. Smaller integrin-binding proteins perform many functions other than those of structural scaffolding. One class of small, integrin-binding proteins encoded by five genes clustered on human chromosome 4 are called the SIBLING (small integrin-binding ligand, N-linked glycoprotein) family. Members include bone sialoprotein, dentin matrix protein, dentin sialophosphoprotein, matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein, and osteopontin. Normally expressed by skeletal tissue, SIBLINGs are thought to play a role in mineralization as well as cellular adhesion and migration. Specific SIBLINGs are also induced in a number of different cancer types including breast, colon, lung, pancreatic, prostate, and thyroid cancers. Individual SIBLING family members have been found to promote angiogenesis and invasiveness. A second small integrinbinding gene family is the connective tissue growth factor/cysteine-rich 61/nephroblastoma overexpressed (CCN) family of proteins. Members of the CNN family contain a conserved insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein motif and are secreted extracellular matrix proteins. CCNs are involved in diverse biological processes such as regulation of cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation and survival. They play important roles in pregnancy, development, angiogenesis, wound repair and inflammation. Certain CCN genes appear to act as tumor-promoting factors, while other CCNs exhibits suppressive capabilities. The focus of this Gordon Research Conference is on defining state-of-the-art knowledge of the biological activities, biochemical interactions and physiological consequences of small-integrin binding proteins in normal and pathological states. This application has as its specific aims to: (1) Convene an international group of experts on SIBLING and CCN biology; (2) Through multidisciplinary presentations determine the state of the art knowledge on small integrin binding proteins in normal physiological function and cancer pathology; (3) Facilitate cross-fertilization of multiple fields (biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, oncology, inflammation, the SIBLING and CCN fields); and (4) spark translational opportunities in the development of novel ways to use SIBLINGs/CCNs as markers for pathological states and discuss therapeutic applications. These aims are directly relevant to the mission of the NIH. The format follows the standard template for a Gordon Research Conference, with an evening introductory evening session, followed by 4 days of morning sessions, late afternoon poster sessions and evening talks in an environment facilitating the open, unhampered discussion of ideas at the frontiers of science. The principal topics to be addressed are: intracellular processing and function of SIBLINGs/CCNs; genetic regulation of SIBLING and CCN genes; SIBLINGs and CCNs in cancer and inflammation; and bioactive fragments of SIBLINGs/CCNs.              n/a",2007 Small Intergin Binding Proteins Gordon Research Conference,7329283,R13HL090059,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Arts', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Class', 'Collagen', 'Colon', 'Cysteine', 'DSPP gene', 'Dentin', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fertilization', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Family', 'Genetic', 'Genus Cola', 'Glycoproteins', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin-Like Growth-Factor-Binding Proteins', 'Integrin Binding', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Mission', 'Molecular Biology', 'NOV gene', 'Nephroblastoma', 'Numbers', 'Pancreas', 'Pathology', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Overexpression', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Siblings', 'Skeletal system', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Thyroid carcinoma', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wound Healing', 'angiogenesis', 'bone sialoprotein', 'cancer type', 'connective tissue growth factor', 'day', 'frontier', 'member', 'migration', 'mineralization', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'oncology', 'osteopontin', 'posters', 'scaffold', 'symposium', 'tumor']",NHLBI,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2007,5000,0.06443294614450137
"Protein structural disorder and ubiquitination    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Defects in the ubiquitin-proteasome system are implicated in the development of numerous human diseases. Some of the natural substrates for ubiquitination and degradation can induce malignant transformation if not properly removed from the cell. Despite the importance of the ubiquitination process, precise identification of ubiquitination (Ub) sites (i.e. acceptor lysine residues to which a ubiquitin molecule is attached) within substrates of ubiquitin ligases is still experimentally challenging. The development of computational approaches to predict Ub sites from a protein sequence provides an attractive alternative to the experimental methods. Here, we propose to develop a computational algorithm that could predict Ub sites with high precision. First, we will identify new protein Ub sites using a combination of multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPit) and mass spectrometry. Different environmental perturbations, such as heat shock, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and starvation for nutrients, will be introduced in order to increase the coverage of the ubiquitinated proteome. Second, we will use the dataset of new Ub sites to develop a ubiquitination sites predictor. A novel machine learning approach that includes co-training of two predictors having different data representations, and the usage of the unlabeled dataset to increase performance accuracy will be utilized. To our knowledge, this will be the first ubiquitination sites predictor developed to date. Finally, we will apply the predictor to the datasets of cell signaling and cancer-associated proteins to predict new ubiquitination sites and substrates among them. The prediction of intrinsic disorder (ID) will be carried out on the same datasets in order to test the hypothesis about preferential occurrence of Ub sites within ID regions. Annotated disease-related mutations will be extracted from three public databases (MutDB, SWISS-PROT and OMIM) and correlated with the predicted ubiquitination sites. The discovery of mutations in proximity to Ub sites or even those directly affecting Ub sites would lay the basis for formulating and testing biologically meaningful hypotheses about their role in cancer and other diseases. Proteins undergo a wide range of modifications that regulate their activity. One of such modification, ubiquitination, was shown to be involved in various human diseases including cancer, renal diseases (von Hippel-Lindau disease, Liddle syndrome, ischemic acute renal failure), several neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer, Parkinson, CAG- expansion disorders). The precise ubiquitination sites in proteins are difficult to detect. We propose to develop a computational approach that could identify such sites with high precision. This would help to develop better drugs that are directed either against the ubiquitinated proteins or against specific sites in these proteins.          n/a",Protein structural disorder and ubiquitination,7256169,R21CA113711,[' '],NCI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R21,2007,188000,0.038937785780923516
"Structure and Affinity: Computing FABP-Lipid Selectivity  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physiological control of the concentration of free fatty acid levels is central to human physiology. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), a large superfamily of proteins found abundantly in many cell types, have been shown to play a role in the organism's ability to control fatty acid levels by selectively binding fatty acids. The details of the ability of these proteins to select fatty acids, based on chain length, saturation state, and headgroup type, is not clear at a molecular level. This is despite the existence of two central ingredients required for such an explanation: highly detailed structures (Banaszak and Cistola) and excellent binding thermodynamics (Kleinfeld). We aim, through this grant proposal, to provide the third needed ingredient for a detailed molecular description of binding. That is, our overall goal is the ability to compute the selective binding of fatty acids within fatty acid binding proteins. We approach this goal through three specific aims. Our first aim is to understand the basis of fatty acid solvation in the homogenous solvents water and octanol. This will provide a reference point for the changes to a heterogeneous environment provided by the fatty acid binding protein and considered in the next two aims. In the second aim, we will directly compute the relative free energy differences underlying discrimination of fatty acids afforded by the intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP). In the third aim we will draw connections between our calculations and the site directed mutants that have been characterized in the Kleinfeld lab. Throughout these aims we will use alchemical mutagenesis calculations with a range of solvation models. In particular, we will be testing new models for solvation developed in the Roux lab. The work will further involve extending our own approaches to relative free energy calculations through dynamic importance sampling, analysis of non-equilibrium work events, extrapolations from histogram analysis and intelligent stepping algorithms along the alchemical reaction coordinate. If we succeed in our long term goal, we will have achieved the ability to rationally design new protein binding interactions enabling discrimination of particular fatty acids.

"Knowledge-based Analysis of Transcription Factor Binding I propose new knowledge-based approaches for determining both the short sequences of DNA to which transcription factors bind and the ways in which the context of these sequences specify regulatory control. I will apply these approaches to recently produced binding data from chromatin-immunoprecipitation microarray efforts in S. cerevisiae. First, I will incorporate information from three-dimensional structures of protein-DNA complexes into motif discovery algorithms to identify over-represented sequences in the bound intergenic regions. Second, I will use machine learning techniques to apply multiple criteria based on biological knowledge of promoter organization to identify which of the binding sites predicted by these algorithms are genuine.

"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development. n/a",Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures,6942980,R01LM005652,"['active sites', 'binding sites', 'computer simulation', 'macromolecule', 'model design /development', 'physical model', 'structural biology']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,324673,0.09940534178955888
"Structure and Affinity: Computing FABP-Lipid Selectivity  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physiological control of the concentration of free fatty acid levels is central to human physiology. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), a large superfamily of proteins found abundantly in many cell types, have been shown to play a role in the organism's ability to control fatty acid levels by selectively binding fatty acids. The details of the ability of these proteins to select fatty acids, based on chain length, saturation state, and headgroup type, is not clear at a molecular level. This is despite the existence of two central ingredients required for such an explanation: highly detailed structures (Banaszak and Cistola) and excellent binding thermodynamics (Kleinfeld). We aim, through this grant proposal, to provide the third needed ingredient for a detailed molecular description of binding. That is, our overall goal is the ability to compute the selective binding of fatty acids within fatty acid binding proteins. We approach this goal through three specific aims. Our first aim is to understand the basis of fatty acid solvation in the homogenous solvents water and octanol. This will provide a reference point for the changes to a heterogeneous environment provided by the fatty acid binding protein and considered in the next two aims. In the second aim, we will directly compute the relative free energy differences underlying discrimination of fatty acids afforded by the intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP). In the third aim we will draw connections between our calculations and the site directed mutants that have been characterized in the Kleinfeld lab. Throughout these aims we will use alchemical mutagenesis calculations with a range of solvation models. In particular, we will be testing new models for solvation developed in the Roux lab. The work will further involve extending our own approaches to relative free energy calculations through dynamic importance sampling, analysis of non-equilibrium work events, extrapolations from histogram analysis and intelligent stepping algorithms along the alchemical reaction coordinate. If we succeed in our long term goal, we will have achieved the ability to rationally design new protein binding interactions enabling discrimination of particular fatty acids. The achievement of this goal would have implications for rational treatment of heart disease and other, e.g. digestive system related, human diseases that involve the control of free fatty acid levels.     n/a",Structure and Affinity: Computing FABP-Lipid Selectivity,6744140,R01GM064746,"['alanine', 'alcohols', 'artificial intelligence', 'chemical models', 'fatty acid binding protein', 'fatty acid transport', 'fatty acids', 'gene mutation', 'intermolecular interaction', 'lipid bilayer membrane', 'molecular dynamics', 'protein structure function', 'site directed mutagenesis', 'thermodynamics', 'water']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,271319,0.12662736541709066
"Knowledge-based Analysis of Transcription Factor Binding I propose new knowledge-based approaches for determining both the short sequences of DNA to which transcription factors bind and the ways in which the context of these sequences specify regulatory control. I will apply these approaches to recently produced binding data from chromatin-immunoprecipitation microarray efforts in S. cerevisiae. First, I will incorporate information from three-dimensional structures of protein-DNA complexes into motif discovery algorithms to identify over-represented sequences in the bound intergenic regions. Second, I will use machine learning techniques to apply multiple criteria based on biological knowledge of promoter organization to identify which of the binding sites predicted by these algorithms are genuine. As a first application of new motifs found using these approaches, I will perform hypothesis-directed sequence analysis to reconcile differences between in vivo binding and the organization of binding sites in promoters.

"Structure based prediction of protein modifications  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genomics revolution has uncovered tens of thousands of proteins, nonetheless full exploitation of organismal genome projects will not occur without innovations in proteomics and structural biology. The agencies meeting this challenge, such as the seven NIH protein structure consortia , have targeted 10,000 new protein structures to be solved by 2010. We propose to use this powerfully enabling structural dataset as the basis for a new type of bioinformatic tool which models and compares the surfaces of proteins, instead of their sequence or backbone path, by analogy to sequence comparison methods. An algorithm that searches a protein's sw-lace features for post-translational modification and binding sites will offer a large step forward. The ability to model protein binding sites will allow investigators to predict how they interact, how regulatory networks are organized, and what determines the order of metabolic pathways--each a fundamental goal of much research. Cognia is well positioned to undertake this effort as we are currently building databases and tools designed to identify drug targets and biotherapeutic candidates for use in both basic research and pharmaceutical-biotech discovery. Our use of predictive tools to analyze, organize, and synthesize the content of databases lends direction to this proposal, and its near-term focus will involve the analysis of post-translational modifications such as the ubiquitylation and SUMOylation accomplished by E3 enzymes during the cell cycle. We anticipate that algorithms developed under this proposal will have many applications, including the ability to (I) predict novel binding interactions of structurally defined proteins (ii) identify structural homologs of proteins not apparent by sequence or backbone similarity searches (iii) define an enzyme's potential substrates, (iv) define structural features of binding sites. In Phase I, we will gather the requisite data and structures and carry out a pilot definition of an E3's consensus binding site. This will provide the foundation for Phase II, where we will create a tool that will scan all known structures for consensi, predicting interactions and modifications.   n/a",Structure based prediction of protein modifications,6551328,R43GM066514,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' informatics', ' molecular biology information system', ' molecular dynamics', ' posttranslational modifications', ' protein binding', ' protein metabolism', ' protein protein interaction', ' protein structure', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,COGNIA CORPORATION,R43,2002,96725,0.01000802098904801
"Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and structure-based design of drugs for treatment, rely on experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins and other macromolecules complexed with small molecule ligands. Many of these structures have direct relevance to public health, especially complexes of drug targets with drugs, inhibitors, substrates, or allosteric effectors. Yet, structure-based drug discovery is severely complicated and hindered by experimental bias and the shortcomings of current methods of experimental ligand identification, which often result in misidentified, missing, or misplaced ligands. The propagation of erroneous structures combined with an increased accessibility to structural data not only thwarts reproducibility in biomedical research and drug discovery, but also diverts valuable resources down doomed research avenues. We will leverage our extensive experience validating and refining ligand binding sites to generate ligand reference libraries that will be made publically available on a new web resource dedicated to the interaction of small molecules and macromolecules. These libraries can be used in many downstream applications, such as drug design, computational chemistry, biology, and bioinformatics. We will utilize recent technological advances in machine learning in conjunction with existing tools to create a standardized protocol for density interpretation and unbiased, reproducible ligand identification. This pipeline will not only be able identify and model ligands in unassigned density fragments, but also be able to detect and correct suboptimally refined ligands in existing structures. As the proposed AI will be free from cognitive bias, it should alleviate the most severe problems in structure-based drug design. Because improperly interpreted structures can have a significant deleterious ripple effect, we will experimentally verify select biomedically important structures with dubious experimental support for critical small molecules using use X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. This proposal addresses current shortcomings of ligand identification in experimentally determined structures through a combination of novel machine learning algorithms and existing validation mechanisms. The main deliverables are 1) curated libraries of validated ligand binding sites and the tools used to produce the libraries and 2) a machine learning assisted pipeline for the interpretation of density fragments corresponding to small molecules within macromolecular structures. Some biologically important ligand binding sites with ambiguous, incomplete, or no experimental data will be experimentally verified using X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy.","Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries",10019572,R01GM132595,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Intuition', 'Ions', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nucleic Acid Binding', 'Ontology', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'density', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'online resource', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'stem', 'structured data', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,561173,0.051034564082979565
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is entitled “Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning.” A number of in- terrelated computational methods for making predictions about the biological behavior of small molecules have been the subject of development within the Jain Laboratory for over twenty years. These share a common strat- egy that considers molecular interactions at their surface interface, where proteins and ligands actually interact. These methods yield measurements of similarity between small molecules or between protein binding pockets. They also yield measurements of the complementarity of a small molecule to a protein binding site (the molecular docking problem). A generalization of these concepts makes possible the construction of a virtual binding site for quantitative activity prediction purely from data about the biological activities of a set of small molecules.  The goals of the proposed work include further improving the accuracy and breadth of applicability of the binding site modeling approach. The primary application of the approach is to guide optimization of leads within medicinal chemistry projects, and to quantify potential off-target effects during pre-clinical drug discovery.  A critical focus of the work will be in data and software dissemination, in order to accelerate the efficient development of targeted therapies. In addition to methods development, the proposed work will involve broad application of these state-of-the-art predictive modeling methods. The proposed work will proceed with the col- laborative input of our pharmaceutical industry colleagues, who have specialized knowledge and data sets that are vital for cutting-edge work in computer-aided drug design.  The expected results include more efficient lead optimization (fewer compounds to reach desired biological pa- rameters), truly effective scaffold replacement (to move away from a molecular series with biological limitations), and improved computational predictions of off-target effects during pre-clinical drug design. Project Narrative This project seeks to refine an integrated platform for physically realistic prediction of ligand binding affinities using multiple methods that span small molecule molecular similarity, molecular docking, and protein binding site similarity. These tools will provide predictive modeling unrestrained by scaffold congruence between what is known and what is to be predicted. Prediction of bioactive molecular poses and activities to guide lead optimiza- tion and to quantify off-target liability effects are applications of the effort, and data and software will be made widely available to academic and industrial research groups.",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,9904662,R01GM101689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Electrostatics', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Industrialization', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Series', 'Structural Models', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'interest', 'lead optimization', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'scaffold', 'segregation', 'small molecule', 'statistical and machine learning', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment fees', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,310202,0.0961866278171613
"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites.

"Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins Project Summary Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to the precision treatment of disease. When high resolution structures of a protein are available, and many isoforms of the protein have been connected to dif- fering binding preferences, it is possible in principle to model the structures of all isoforms and discover the mechanisms that cause variations in binding preferences. Unfortunately, this discovery process depends on human expertise for examining molecular structure, and given that hundreds of isoforms may exist, a human would be overwhelmed to objectively examine many similar isoforms. To fill this gap, this project will (A1) de- velop software that identifies structural mechanisms that cause differential binding preferences, categorizes similar structural mechanisms, and explains the mechanisms in English. The second aim of this project (A2) is to validate the software at a large scale on families of proteins that exhibit a variety of well-examined binding preferences, and through blind predictions with experimental collaborators. Our approach involves creating software that mimics the visual reasoning techniques employed by structural biologists when examining molecular structures. Not only are these techniques responsible for most major dis- coveries in structural biology, but they are also straightforward to understand by non-computational research- ers. This property will enable our software to immediately integrate into existing workflows at labs that do not focus on computational methods. This property also contrasts from existing methods, which generally output structural models, potential energies, p-values and structural scores which are difficult for non-experts to un- derstand or incorporate into their research. Often, an expert in biophysics is required to interpret the outputs so that they can be operationalized in laboratory environments. In preliminary results, our methods have already identified molecular mechanisms that govern specificity in several families of proteins. Verification against peer-reviewed experimentation has proven the preliminary results correct in almost all cases. Our methods have also been applied to make a blind prediction of binding mechanisms in the ricin toxin, which binds to and damages the human ribosome. With experimental collabo- rators, we showed that our methods correctly identified and predicted the roles of several amino acids with a hitherto unknown role in recognizing the ribosome.

"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9849781,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,393339,0.17343092939220825
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases. When transcription factors function they produce eRNAs. We have developed a prototype technique that leverages eRNAs to infer the activity of all TF in a cell simultaneously.",A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity,9963292,R01GM125871,"['Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'ESR1 gene', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Estradiol', 'Familial Platelet Disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Pattern', 'Polymerase', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Waardenburg syndrome', 'Work', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'cooking', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prototype', 'response', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2020,359286,0.12504893269167883
"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods. TNF receptors are the common drug targets for autoimmune diseases. Understand their cellular mechanism of binding therefore is highly relevant to public health.",Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces,9983105,R01GM122804,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Avidity', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fibrinogen', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Homo', 'Host Defense', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune System', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutate', 'N-terminal', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cell injury', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large-scale database', 'method development', 'multi-scale modeling', 'pathogen', 'physical process', 'protein complex', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'recruit', 'simulation', 'tumor necrosis factor receptor binding']",NIGMS,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,327738,0.16819906268993806
