"TOPIC 389 - INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING Besides surgery, radiotherapy is the most effective treatment modality for localized prostate cancer. The success of radiotherapy stems from the exploit of a therapeutic window in tumor response and normal tissue tolerance which maximizes the chance of sterilizing the tumor while sparing the surrounding normal tissue from severe damage. This requires an accurate and individualized radiation dose distribution generated from the examination of the patient’s medical images. Radiation therapy is technically complex and labor intensive. Intensive human supervision and intervention are needed throughout the path of patient care.   Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are adept at automating workflows and tasks—in this case the development of cancer treatment plans. We believe that this machine learning has incredible potential to address inherent problems in the existing treatment planning workflow. Our approach will mitigate the current issues with treatment planning, integrate seamlessly with day-to-day operations, and will serve as a treatment solution that benefits patients in a way that limits their risk and extends their lives.   The goal of this project is to develop a start-to-end prostate cancer treatment planning system. We will work with three expert radiation oncology teams to archive existing patient data for use in training of artificial intelligence algorithms. These algorithms will enable high quality plans to be generated with ease. At the completion of Phase I, we will have a prototype interface that will allow users to create treatment plans and segmentation using artificial intelligence algorithms. Additionally, users will be able to evaluate these plans against other expert plans and against the training data. n/a",TOPIC 389 - INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING,10027492,5N91019C00053,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Patient', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Pythons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'data reduction', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'response', 'stem', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'web interface']",NCI,"RADIASOFT, LLC",N43,2019,300000,0.10826145292511127
"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9745302,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'random forest', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,1,0.13623444606780827
"Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY About 2/3 of cancer patients in US receive radiation therapy either alone or in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. Treatment planning, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, is analogous to the design of a blueprint for building construction. If a treatment plan is poorly designed, the desired treatment outcome cannot be achieved, no matter how well other components of radiation therapy are performed. In the current clinical workflow, a treatment planner works towards a good quality plan in a trial-and-error fashion. Many rounds of consultation between the planner and physician are needed to reach a plan of physician's satisfaction, because physician's preference for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and precisely conveyed to the planner. Consequently, planning time can be up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor and can vary significantly due to varying levels of physician and planner's skills and physician-planner cooperation, etc., which substantially deteriorates treatment outcomes. For example, head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with suboptimal plans present 20% lower 2-year overall survival and 24% higher 2-year local-regional failure. Prolonged overall treatment process due to treatment planning reduces local-regional control rate by 12–14% per week. Furthermore, as patient's anatomy can rapidly change within the planning time, the optimally designed plan becomes inappropriate for the changed anatomy. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made colossal advancements. We believe that AI technologies have a great potential to revolutionize treatment planning. Treatment planning consists of two major aspects: commonality and individuality. By exploiting the commonality through deep supervised learning, we can develop a treatment plan as good as those for previously treated similar patients. The individuality can be actualized by learning physician's special considerations for a particular patient using deep reinforcement learning. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of these ideas. We hypothesize that an AI-based intelligent treatment planning system can consistently produce high-quality treatment plans with extremely high efficiency. This hypothesis will be tested using H&N cancer patients as a test bed via two aims. Aim 1, System development. Develop two deep-learning models to realize the proposed treatment planning workflow and incorporate them into a clinical environment. Aim 2, System validation. Acquire and analyze planning data before and after system implementation. The innovation of this project is the use and customization of the state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve a clinically important problem. These technologies would revolutionize treatment planning process, leading to the efficient generation of consistently high quality plans, irrespective of human skills, experiences, and communications, etc. Besides the significance demonstrated for the H&N cancer patients, the system can be easily extended to other tumor sites, yielding more substantial impacts. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal and varying quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. This project will use and customize the state-of- the-art artificial intelligence techniques to develop an intelligent treatment planning system that is capable of efficiently and consistently generating high quality plans.",Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy,9712062,R01CA237269,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Beds', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conceptions', 'Consultations', 'Curiosities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Generations', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individuality', 'Intelligence', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'experience', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'negative affect', 'optimal treatments', 'population based', 'preference', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,584676,0.1000523446639158
"An Automated Patient Chart Error Detection System for Radiation Therapy Project Summary/Abstract Every year, approximately 1,200 severe mistreatments happen in radiation therapy. Radiation therapy lawsuits rank in the top third of all medical specialties with an average of $313,000 per claim settled or litigated. The current method for detecting treatment errors is by a weekly patient chart check, where each treatment record is manually reviewed on a weekly basis. This labor-intensive and inefficient method prevents us from detecting the treatment error at an early stage. Here we propose a novel software system, ChartAlert, for automating patient chart checking. ChartAlert is a prospective real-time adaptive electronic checking system that can be configured to support different clinical workflows and perform “smart” check using artificial intelligence. It supports two major treatment databases (Elekta MOSAIQ and Varian ARIA) in radiotherapy. In Phase I project, we have successfully developed ChartAlert for MOSAIQ prototype that is under clinical testing in two treatment centers. Our preliminary results demonstrated the significant improvement of effectiveness in patient chart checking and the flexibility of supporting different workflows. In this Phase II proposal, we will continue the ChartAlert development. We will demonstrate the feasibility of the ChartAlert approach and its advantages over the standard manual checking method. We will develop a prospective checking module, develop the ARIA data translation module for ChartAlert for ARIA, design and implement an AI-based “smart” check module, and verify the proposed system at the partner sites. Successful completion of these aims will demonstrate the feasibility and commercial potential of the ChartAlert approach. Ultimately, this work will result in an intelligent patient chart checking software, which will increase patient chart check efficiency, save staff time, improve cancer patient treatment safety, and preventing potential lawsuits. Project Narrative Treatment errors in radiation oncology occur at a rate of 2% per patient, and radiation therapy lawsuits rank in the top third of all medical specialties with regard to claims made, claims paid, and damages. Current methods of detecting treatment errors are manual and inefficient. There is a critical need for efficient treatment error detection in order to improve patient safety and save cost. We propose to develop a scalable and comprehensive software system (ChartAlert) for automated patient chart error detection in radiation therapy. ChartAlert can be extended to other types of patient charts to check treatment and prescription consistency and improve patient safety.",An Automated Patient Chart Error Detection System for Radiation Therapy,9845105,R42CA195819,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Innovation Corps', 'Insurance', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Records', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Framework', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'maltreatment', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'research clinical testing', 'software development', 'software systems', 'success', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'treatment site', 'tumor']",NCI,"INFONDRIAN, LLC",R42,2019,894987,0.08756218303603021
"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",9798875,R01EB028591,"['Affect', 'Alkalies', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calcium Oxalate', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Subjects', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ureteroscopy', 'Uric Acid', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcium phosphate', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'prevent', 'risk minimization', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,357486,0.060517184859152515
"DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND AND DUPLICATE EXPERTS RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING FOR PROSTATE CANCER Use of the Oncospace framework for AI-based prostate radiotherapy treatment planning  The goal of this program is to establish a fully automated treatment planning method for low, intermediate, and high-risk prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. The program will use artificial intelligence (AI) methods trained with our existing database of over 1600 prostate treatment plans including clinical outcomes. Results inherently reflect the expert judgement of the original planners regarding dosimetric tradeoffs. The methods will include integrity checking of normal anatomy and target volume structures to identify potential manual or automatic contouring errors. The system will be used to automate treatment plan generation from the point when structures have been drawn until the plan requires expert assessment/approval. Plans for patients in each risk category will be validated against those generated and approved by three expert radiation oncologists, where assessment criteria is decided upon a priori by consensus between experts. Benefits include time savings via use of knowledge-driven versus trial and error-based plan objectives, more personalized treatment plans and improved quality control. n/a",DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND AND DUPLICATE EXPERTS RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING FOR PROSTATE CANCER,10027481,5N91019C00044,"['Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Patient', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Structure', 'Structure of base of prostate', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prostate cancer risk', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NCI,"ONCOSPACE, INC.",N01,2019,299433,0.06940498926009561
"Automatic Thoracic Organ Segmentation Tool for Radiation Treatment Planning of Cancers in Thoracic Region ABSTRACT As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention. Cancers in the thoracic region, which include lung, esophageal, thymus, mesothelioma and breast cancers, are among the most pervasive and deadly cancers. The protection of normal thoracic organs including lungs, heart, esophagus and spinal cord is critical in reducing long term toxicity in such cancers. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to such organs-at-risk (OARs), they are required to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans during radiation treatment planning to get an accurate dosage distribution. Despite tremendous effort into the development of semi- or fully-automatic segmentation solutions, current automated segmentation software, mostly using the atlas-based methods, has not yet reached the level of accuracy and robustness required for clinical usage. Therefore, in current practice, significant manual efforts are still required in the OAR segmentation process. Manual contouring suffers from inter- and intra-observer variability as well as institutional variability where different sites adopt distinct contouring atlases and labeling criteria and thus leads to inaccuracy and variability in OAR segmentation. When OARs are very close to the treatment target, segmentation errors as small as a few millimeters can have a statistically significant impact on dosimetry distribution and outcome. In addition, it is also costly and time consuming as it can take 1-2 hours of a clinicians’ time to segment major thoracic organs due to the large number of axial slices required. The associated human efforts would significantly increase if adaptive radiation therapy (ART) is used as OARs from two or more simulation CT scans need to be segmented to adjust treatment plans. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning methods has revolutionized many computer-vision areas and the adoption of deep learning in medical applications has shown great success. Based on a deep-learning-based algorithm we developed that achieved better-than-human performance and ranked 1st in 2017 American Association of Physicist in Medicine Thoracic Auto-segmentation Challenge, a thoracic OAR auto-segmentation product will be developed in this project with the two aims: 1) improve and validate the deep-learning-based automatic thoracic organ segmentation algorithm on a larger clinical data set, and 2) incorporate this algorithm into a preliminary product that fits into the clinical workflow. With this product, the segmentation accuracy can be improved, leading to more robust treatment plans in protecting normal organs and improved long term patient outcome. Furthermore, the time and cost of radiation treatment planning can be greatly reduced, contributing to a more affordable cancer treatment and reduced healthcare burden. NARRATIVE As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to such organs-at-risk (OARs), they are required to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans.

"Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics The complex environment of modern radiation therapy (RT) comprises data from a rich combination of patient- specific information including: demographics, physical characteristics of high-energy dose, features subsequent to repeated application of image-guidance (radiomics), and biological markers (genomics, proteomics, etc.), generated before and/or over a treatment period that can span few days to several weeks. Rapid growth of these available and untapped “pan-Omics” data, invites ample opportunities for Big data analytics to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine in RT. This particularly true in promising but high-risk RT procedures such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), which have witnessed tremendous expansion due to clinical successes in early disease stages and socio-economic benefits of shortened high dose treatments. This has led to the desire to exploit these treatments into more advanced stages of cancer, however, the unknown risks associated with increased toxicities hamper its potential. Therefore, robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) capable of exploring the complex pan-Omics interaction landscape with the goal of exploiting known principles of treatment response before and during the course of fractionated RT are urgently needed. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome barriers related to prediction uncertainties and human-computer interactions, which are currently limiting the ability to make personalized clinical decisions for real-time response-based adaptation in radiotherapy from available data. To meet this need and overcome current challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team including: clinicians, medical physicists, data scientists, and human factor experts. Specifically, we will develop and quantitively evaluate: (1) graph-based supervised machine learning algorithms for robust prediction outcomes before and during RT; (2) deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize treatment adaptation; and (3) a user-centered software prototype for RT decision support, with the broader goal of building a comprehensive real-time framework for outcome modeling and response-based adaption in RT. We hypothesize that the use of advanced machine learning techniques and user-centered tools will unlock the potentials to move from current population-based approaches limited by subjective experiences and heuristic rules into robust, patient-specific, user-friendly CDSSs. This approach and its corresponding software tool will be tested within two clinical RT sites of lung and liver cancers, to demonstrate its versatility and highlight pertinent human-computer factors and cancer specific issues. Impact statement: Patient-specific big data are now available before and/or during RT courses, offering new and untapped opportunities for personalized treatment. This study will overcome current shortcomings of population-based approaches and data underuse in current RT practice by investigating and developing an intelligent, computer-aided, user-centered, personalized CDSS and test its performance in rewarding but high- risk RT scenarios. The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens. With the wide variety of treatment prescription options in radiation therapy, physicians and patients need to weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment; these treatments are delivered over multiple treatment sessions where additional patient-specific data become available. Clinical decision support can play a pivotal role in deliberations related to response-based adaptation of treatment. Therefore, we are exploring and benchmarking large-scale adaptive machine learning methods for building a robust decision support system tool in terms of efficacy, human-computer factors, and the ability to handle large data uncertainties for clinical practice in the complex but promising environment of high dose radiation treatment of lung and liver cancers as case studies.",Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics,9816658,R01CA233487,"['Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Network', 'Bedside Testings', 'Benchmarking', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose Fractionation', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hostage', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reaction Time', 'Regimen', 'Regrets', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computer human interaction', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'demographics', 'experience', 'heuristics', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'irradiation', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'radiation risk', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'side effect', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,451307,0.055688222247904366
"Ultraportable Stroke CT Based on Stationary Carbon Nanotube X-ray Source and Deep Learning Image Formation PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this 12-month SBIR phase 1 project is developing an imaging device that will enable highly efficient and cost-effective stroke imaging for patients suffered trauma events.

Imaging systems with such capabilities will address the current deficiency in timely diagnosis of stroke patients, and benefit society with higher efficiency and lower cost. Such imaging device will make a strong economic impact on the global head CT imaging market, which is estimated to be about $36 billion in the U.S. In a longer term, the novel imaging technology could be translated into markets for security screening, industry inspection, and dental imaging. This project is based on the recent research results by Dr. Cao's team under the support of an NSF CAREER award (PI Dr. Cao, 08/01/2014-07/31/2019, $400,000) and a Dr. Cao's Commonwealth Research Commercialization Fund (CRCF) award (Title: “Computed Tomography Without Moving Parts for Fast and Portable Biomedical Imaging”, 07/01/2017- 06/30/2019, $100,000). The project has a strong footing in intellectual property. The technology is protected by a few patent applications at the Virginia Tech, including US. 62/316649, “Ultrafast Micro-CT for Imaging Free-Moving Animals” (Inventor: Guohua Cao), and PCT/US2013/061049 and US14/429835, “System and Method of Stationary Source Computed Tomography” (Inventor: Guohua Cao, et. al.). In this project, the team will design and build a proof-of-concept head CT platform to test the feasibility of ultraportable and compact head CT based on the stationary carbon nanotube x-ray source design and deep learning image reconstruction algorithm. The expected outcomes from this project include demonstration of the feasibility for ultrafast, low dose, and diagnostic imaging capabilities for intracerebral hemorrhage in head phantoms (ICH), with potential automatic ICH identification through deep learning algorithm. A ready-to- prototype head CT device will be optimized and designed, and a corresponding business plan will be developed. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a common of death in the world at tremendous social and healthcare costs. Currently head CT is typically used for initial evaluation of stroke patients for signs of intracerebral hemorrhage.

"An interactive deep-learning method to semi-automatically segment abdominal organs to support stereotactic MR guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) for abdominal cancers Abstract  Stereotactic MRI-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) is an effective treatment for the pancreas and other upper abdominal cancers. SMART allows precise delivery of escalated prescription dose to the abdominal tumor targets while avoiding the complications of radiation toxicity to the mobile gastrointestinal (GI) organs surrounding the tumor target. In the clinical workflow of SMART, manual segmentation of the GI orangs at risk (OARs) is one of the most important but also the most labor-intensive steps. Manual segmentation takes 10 minutes on average but ranges from 5 to 22 minutes. The slow and costly manual segmentation step directly decreases the accessibility and affordability of online SMART and indirectly reduces the effectiveness of SMART due to intra-fractional body and organ movement of the patients. In this study, we will develop a deep-learning based interactive and semi-automatic procedure to accurately and quickly segment the GI OARs to make SMART more efficient and affordable. Stereotactic MRI-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) has been demonstrated as an effective treatment for the pancreas and other upper abdominal cancers. For nonresectable pancreatic cancer, SMART increased the overall survival at 36 months from 18% to 55% compared to conventional radiation therapy (RT) treatment. In this study, we will develop a deep-learning based interactive and semi-automatic method to accurately and quickly segment the organs-at- risk (OAR) in the abdomen to support SMART. The method to be developed will significantly expedite the OAR segmentation step and make SMART more efficient and affordable.",An interactive deep-learning method to semi-automatically segment abdominal organs to support stereotactic MR guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) for abdominal cancers,9807610,R03EB028427,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Clinical', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dose', 'Dose-Rate', 'Duodenum', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Kidney', 'Large Intestine', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of abdomen', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Toxicity', 'Radiation therapy', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Small Intestines', 'Stomach', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'gastrointestinal', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'irradiation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preservation', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'tumor']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,89216,0.032651609961208944
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"Systems biology modeling of radiation resistance and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma Tumor resistance to radiation therapy remains a significant obstacle to long-term cancer patient survival, especially for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a cancer type with poor long-term outcomes (less than 50% advanced stage five-year survival). To overcome the problem of radiation resistance, radiation therapy is being combined with radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies. Prediction of an individual’s sensitivity to radiation and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies prior to treatment would improve the development of personalized treatment plans for cancer patients. Efforts are being made to create systems biology models of cancer cells for biomarker discovery and prediction of treatment response; however, due to methodological shortcomings, failure to integrate multi-omic data on a genome-scale, and lack of specificity to individual patient tumors, these predictive models have yet to be implemented clinically. To address these needs, the objective of this project is to develop a personalized systems biology modeling platform for individualized prediction of HNSCC patient tumor response to radiation and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies. These models will be created by first integrating comprehensive biological data on individual patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This approach will allow for the comparison of metabolic, signaling, and phenotypic signatures between radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant patient tumors. By then integrating the mechanisms of action of radiation therapy and radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies into the modeling framework, the response to particular chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in individual radiation- resistant patient tumors can be predicted. Machine learning classifiers will be developed from TCGA patient data and model predictions to determine which biological and clinical factors are most predictive of radiation sensitivity and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy success. It is hypothesized that differential response to chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in radiation-resistant HNSCC tumors is accomplished through redox metabolism and signaling, and components of redox biology within the modeling framework will significantly enrich the list of predictive biomarkers for combination therapy success. Although the focus of this project will be on HNSCC, this systems biology modeling approach will be applicable to any cancer type. The outcomes of this project will be a reduced set of clinically-measurable biomarkers for accurate prediction of HNSCC patient response to radiation therapy and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies, as well as a precision medicine platform to test clinically relevant therapeutic strategies. This project is innovative because it combines multi-omic cancer patient data with state-of-the-art systems biology modeling techniques to investigate the biological mechanisms of radiation resistance, as well as to predict chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy response in individual radiation-resistant patients. Combination therapies that include both radiation and chemotherapy are currently being developed for cancer patients that do not respond well to radiation therapy alone. This research will provide insights into why particular head and neck cancer patients do not respond well to radiation therapy, as well as predict which chemotherapy- radiation combination treatments will be most effective for individual patients. Findings from this research will improve our ability to develop personalized treatment plans for cancer patients, which will decrease healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes.",Systems biology modeling of radiation resistance and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,9676052,F30CA224968,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Measurable', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'NADP', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Cancer Model', 'Predictive Value', 'Prior Therapy', 'Production', 'RNA Interference', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tobacco use', 'beta-Lapachone', 'biomarker discovery', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'radiation resistance', 'radiation response', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'success', 'transcription factor', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F30,2019,45081,0.09032185928180318
"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice. There is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour organs at risk in medical images at a high degree of automation for impacting current practice of radiation therapy planning. Encouraged by strong competitive results from the Phase I part of this project, in this grant, further technical advances and a cloud-based software service are proposed. A multicenter clinical evaluation of the new product is also planned to assess the clinical efficacy of the system.",Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning,9761481,R42CA199735,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Blinded', 'Body Regions', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Object Attachment', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Service delivery model', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'software as a service', 'software development', 'software systems', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'virtual']",NCI,"QUANTITATIVE RADIOLOGY SOLUTIONS, LLC",R42,2019,873369,0.05455796068735862
"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,9881453,U24EB028936,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2019,397500,0.13142864527300357
"Mitigating High Grade Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia through Pretreatment Autologous Lymphocyte Infusion PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation induced lymphopenia (RIL) is a common radiation-related toxicity that has been recognized for over a century but often ignored as clinically inconsequential. However, accumulating evidence has demonstrated strong association of high grade RIL (seen in 30-50% of patients) with poor prognosis. The pervasive role of radiotherapy in the curative management of solid tumors supports the need to develop mitigating strategies, particularly for patients with a high risk of developing grade 4 (G4) RIL. We have compelling evidence from both clinical and preclinical work that severe RIL impacts cancer control and therapy effectiveness, and methods to reduce RIL may improve treatment outcomes. To further develop these approaches for clinical translation, we have proposed 2 specific aims. In aim 1, we will build on our initial prediction model for G4 RIL and leverage our large database of esophageal cancer patients who have completed chemoradiation (CRT) to develop a better predictive model for G4 RIL so that we can rapidly and efficiently identify the highest risk patients for mitigating strategies. In aim 2, we will determine the feasibility and safety of raising the baseline lymphocyte levels by autologous lymphocyte infusion (ALI) prior to initiating CRT. Fundamentally, this research will allow us to develop the necessary computational tool capable of properly identifying patients at risk for developing severe RIL, and complete a small feasibility and safety study of using ALI as a way to raise the baseline pre-treatment lymphocyte levels so that the probability of developing G4 RIL could be possibly curtailed. By targeting the at-risk patients to receive RIL mitigating strategies, we will hopefully be able to improve the cancer outcomes of standard cancer therapies, and build on current innovative strategies of immunotherapy and radiation combinations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Radiation therapy, a key pillar in the management of cancers, causes a common yet ignored side effect of radiation induced lymphopenia (RIL). Severe RIL has been linked to poor outcomes of patients, presumably due to reduced immune surveillance thereby increasing disease recurrence after radiation therapy. We propose developing a prediction model to help identify who are most at risk for developing severe RIL, and conduct a pilot study to help reduce the impact of RIL so that clinical outcomes for these at-risk patients will improve in the future.",Mitigating High Grade Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia through Pretreatment Autologous Lymphocyte Infusion,9807793,R21CA240881,"['Applications Grants', 'Bayesian Prediction', 'Blood Component Removal', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Combination immunotherapy', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Inferior', 'Infusion procedures', 'Link', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Lymphocyte', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphopenia', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nomograms', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Proliferating', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Validation', 'Work', 'autologous lymphocytes', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'disorder control', 'fundamental research', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized approach', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'radiation effect', 'response', 'safety and feasibility', 'safety study', 'side effect', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R21,2019,211410,0.037054106769641326

It is increasingly utilized to treat patients with unresectable liver tumors in second or third line, but some of its potential to improve overall survival is still untapped. The major obstacle in making SIRT more efficient is the treatment planning. It consists in selecting the 90Y activity to inject based on the estimated dose to the tumor and organs-at-risk. The problem is that the dose calculation is highly unreliable and does not include important parameters, such as well-known non-uniformities or the injection point. As a result, physicians often choose very conservative dosage to limit toxicity at the expense of the tumor(s) dose, which drastically reduces SIRT efficacy. The objective of this project is to develop accurate patient-specific dosimetry for SIRT planning. We propose a novel method combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the 90Y microsphere 3D distribution and 90Y physics modeling to predict the absorbed dose. The central and novel approach is to carry out the CFD simulations for each patient's hepatic arterial tree to achieve high accuracy and precision, because anatomical features determining the microsphere distribution present wide variations across the patient population and prohibit the use of generic models. This novel CFD-based dosimetry will be the first comprehensive tool to integrate (1) the hepatic arterial tree extracted from the patient's standard-of-care angiogram, (2) CFD simulation in this hepatic arterial tree to predict and optimize the microsphere distribution, (3) calculation of the absorbed dose with 90Y physics modeling. Our long-term goal is developing a tool that can be integrated in clinical workflow to optimize the quantity and injection point of 90Y microspheres during SIRT planning. To this end, we will pursue two specific aims. (1) We will develop the CFD model and dose calculation using a pig model for validation; (2) we will develop a deep learning approach to simultaneously segment the hepatic artery from the standard-of-care patient angiograms and conduct a morphometric study of the obtained hepatic arterial trees to identify the principal parameters affecting the model. If successful, this project will generate a reliable, patient-specific dosimetry for SIRT providing a comprehensive calculation of the absorbed dose in individual lesions as well as in the healthy liver. This will enable high precision treatment planning to better treat the tumors with a “dose-painting” approach and ultimately improve long-term patient outcome. Narrative Liver cancer is one the most prevalent type of cancer with deadly outcome in the U.S. and worldwide. It is increasingly treated with selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) but due to severe limitations in treatment planning and dose calculation in particular, the efficacy of SIRT is drastically reduced. This work addresses this central issue by developing new dosimetry to personalize treatment planning for each patient, with the ultimate goal of improving liver cancer long-term patient outcome.",Personalized dosimetry for liver cancer radioembolization using fluid dynamics simulation,9723557,R21CA237686,"['3-Dimensional', '90Y', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Albumins', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Convolution Kernel', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distal', 'Doppler Ultrasound', 'Dose', 'Family suidae', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatic artery', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radioactive', 'Radioembolization', 'Radioisotopes', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tracer', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Trees', 'Unresectable', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer type', 'clinical implementation', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dosage', 'dosimetry', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'internal radiation', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2019,201430,0.07721555109334438
"STAN-CT: Standardization and Normalization of CT images for Lung Cancer Patients Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and one of the most common cancers among both men and women in the United States. Recent advances in high-resolution imaging set the stage for radiomics to become an active emerging field in cancer research. However, the promise of radiomics is limited by a lack of image standardization tools, because computed tomography (CT) images are often acquired using scanners from different vendors with customized acquisition parameters, posing a fundamental challenge to radiomic studies across sites. To overcome this challenge, especially for large-scale, multi-site radiomic studies, advanced algorithms are required to integrate, standardize, and normalize CT images from multiple sources. We propose to develop STAN-CT, a deep learning software package that can automatically standardize and normalize a large volume of diagnostic images to facilitate cross-site large-scale image feature extraction for lung cancer characterization and stratification. By precisely mitigating the differences in advanced radiomic features of CT images, STAN-CT will overcome research silos and promote medical image resource sharing, ultimately improving the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Our goal will be achieved through two Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a working prototype to standardize CT images. First, we will collect raw image data from lung cancer patients and reconstruct CT images using multiple image reconstruction parameters, and we will scan a multipurpose chest phantom along with five different nodule inserts. Then, we will develop and train STAN-CT for CT image standardization. An alternative training architecture will be developed to achieve the improved model training stability. In Aim 2. We will deploy and test STAN-CT for image standardization locally and across three medical centers. First, we will make the STAN-CT software package available to the public by providing a menu-driven web-interface so that that users can conveniently convert medical images that were taken using non-standard protocols to one or multiple standards that they specify. Second, we will deploy STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky for local performance validation. We will test the functionality, reliability, and performance of STAN-CT using both patient chest CT image data collected at large-scale and the phantom image data, both independent to training. Third, we will deploy and test STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky as well as the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Emory University for cross- center performance validation. We will use the same multipurpose chest phantom and both standard and non- standard protocols to validate STAN-CT at the three centers. We will test the generalizability of STAN-CT using clinical CT images of human patients and will determine whether a model trained using the data from one medical center are applicable for images collected at another place. Finally, we will distribute the software package of STAN-CT for public use. STAN-CT will enable a wide range of radiomic researches to identify diagnostic image features that strongly associated with lung cancer prognosis. Project Narrative Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most popular diagnostic image modalities routinely used for assessing anatomical tissue characteristics for disease management.

"Development and Validation of a Collaborative Web/Cloud-Based Dosimetry System for Radiopharmaceutical Therapy. Project Summary  Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) – the use of targeted radionuclides to deliver radiation specifically to cancer cells and their microenvironment – is a fundamentally different approach to cancer therapy that is growing, with a substantial number of large and small pharmaceuticals companies developing products in this area and radionuclide producers making substantial investments in scaling up production. This is especially true in the area of alpha emitters. The dosimetric evaluation of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals is a key requirement for regulatory approval and optimal administration of RPTs, especially in combination with external beam radiation therapy. This project will provide a cloud-based dosimetry software service, delivered through a web-browser, that includes the full complement of methods needed for dosimetry in the context of obtaining regulatory approval of RPTs and, ultimately, for optimal clinical delivery. Providing this in a cloud-based system will enable a variety of models for selling the service that do not require a large up-front capital investment for clinics or radiopharmaceutical developers. It also will provide access to expert advice, customization, and dosimetry services, and allow for collaboration between developers, dosimetry experts, and clinical sites. To accomplish the goal of developing this cloud-based web-browser-delivered RPT dosimetry software service, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Design, develop and implement a web/cloud-based integrated software system for treatment planning of RPT therapy; (2) design and implement a full server-side framework for subscription, authentication, and granting collaborative privileges for the various processes and data in the dosimetry pipeline; (3) optimize and adapt the four most computationally intensive processes for a multi-processor cloud-based compute environment; (4) apply and evaluate the toolchain developed in aims 1-3 to phantom, simulated and existing patient data. Successful completion of this project will produce a cloud-based software system delivered to the user via a web browser that provides an integrated, streamlined, robust, state-of-the-art system for RPT treatment planning. This system would enable a collaborative approach to multi-center clinical trials and eventually to clinical delivery of optimally dosed RPT.

"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9527787,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,347700,0.13623444606780827
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9476341,R01HL122484,"['3D ultrasound', '4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'perfusion imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,770494,0.0863670608896659
"Systems biology modeling of radiation resistance and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma Tumor resistance to radiation therapy remains a significant obstacle to long-term cancer patient survival, especially for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a cancer type with poor long-term outcomes (less than 50% advanced stage five-year survival). To overcome the problem of radiation resistance, radiation therapy is being combined with radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies. Prediction of an individual’s sensitivity to radiation and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies prior to treatment would improve the development of personalized treatment plans for cancer patients. Efforts are being made to create systems biology models of cancer cells for biomarker discovery and prediction of treatment response; however, due to methodological shortcomings, failure to integrate multi-omic data on a genome-scale, and lack of specificity to individual patient tumors, these predictive models have yet to be implemented clinically. To address these needs, the objective of this project is to develop a personalized systems biology modeling platform for individualized prediction of HNSCC patient tumor response to radiation and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies. These models will be created by first integrating comprehensive biological data on individual patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This approach will allow for the comparison of metabolic, signaling, and phenotypic signatures between radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant patient tumors. By then integrating the mechanisms of action of radiation therapy and radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies into the modeling framework, the response to particular chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in individual radiation- resistant patient tumors can be predicted. Machine learning classifiers will be developed from TCGA patient data and model predictions to determine which biological and clinical factors are most predictive of radiation sensitivity and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy success. It is hypothesized that differential response to chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in radiation-resistant HNSCC tumors is accomplished through redox metabolism and signaling, and components of redox biology within the modeling framework will significantly enrich the list of predictive biomarkers for combination therapy success. Although the focus of this project will be on HNSCC, this systems biology modeling approach will be applicable to any cancer type. The outcomes of this project will be a reduced set of clinically-measurable biomarkers for accurate prediction of HNSCC patient response to radiation therapy and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies, as well as a precision medicine platform to test clinically relevant therapeutic strategies. This project is innovative because it combines multi-omic cancer patient data with state-of-the-art systems biology modeling techniques to investigate the biological mechanisms of radiation resistance, as well as to predict chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy response in individual radiation-resistant patients. Combination therapies that include both radiation and chemotherapy are currently being developed for cancer patients that do not respond well to radiation therapy alone. This research will provide insights into why particular head and neck cancer patients do not respond well to radiation therapy, as well as predict which chemotherapy- radiation combination treatments will be most effective for individual patients. Findings from this research will improve our ability to develop personalized treatment plans for cancer patients, which will decrease healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes.",Systems biology modeling of radiation resistance and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,9541230,F30CA224968,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Measurable', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'NADP', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Cancer Model', 'Predictive Value', 'Prior Therapy', 'Production', 'RNA Interference', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tobacco use', 'beta-Lapachone', 'biomarker discovery', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'radiation resistance', 'radiation response', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'success', 'transcription factor', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F30,2018,44589,0.09032185928180318
"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice. There is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour organs at risk in medical images at a high degree of automation for impacting current practice of radiation therapy planning. Encouraged by strong competitive results from the Phase I part of this project, in this grant, further technical advances and a cloud-based software service are proposed. A multicenter clinical evaluation of the new product is also planned to assess the clinical efficacy of the system.",Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning,9622047,R42CA199735,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blinded', 'Body Regions', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Object Attachment', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Service delivery model', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'software as a service', 'software development', 'software systems', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'virtual']",NCI,"QUANTITATIVE RADIOLOGY SOLUTIONS, LLC",R42,2018,1057846,0.05455796068735862
"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,9477411,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Endoscopy', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation induced damage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'public health relevance', 'radiation risk', 'radiological imaging', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,245857,0.17592033961564996
"Fast and Robust Low-Dose X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction Abstract:  The use of CT scans has recently increased, for example, in virtual colonoscopy, CT cardiac screening, screening of the lung in smokers, whole-body CT in asymptomatic patients, and CT imaging of children. Shortening of the scanning time to around 1 second, eliminating the strict need for the subject to remain still or be sedated, is one of the main reasons for the large increase in the pediatric population. CT scans of children have been estimated to produce non-negligible increases in the probability of lifetime cancer mortality, leading to calls for the use of reduced current settings for CT scans of children. For these reasons, the CT industry has put in a lot of effort to develop low-dose CT. One active area of research is methods to reduce the radiation counts by applying adaptive collimation to block unnecessary x-ray photons. Another active area of research is the development of more robust image reconstruction algorithms that are less sensitive to noise for low-count data.  This grant proposal is focused on the second approach — development of fast and robust reconstruction algorithms. It is known that some iterative image reconstruction algorithms outperform the analytical filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm in terms of producing less-noisy images with the same data set. One disadvantage of these iterative algorithms is their long computation time, making them impractical in a real- world CT reconstruction tasks. For this reason, the FBP algorithm is still the main work horse for CT applications.  The main goal of the proposed research is to develop fast and robust iterative-algorithms so that their computation time is at the same order of an analytic FBP algorithm, using experimental low-dose phantom, cadaver data, and low-dose cancer screen chest CT patient data to perform comparison studies. We will answer the question: When the fast and robust algorithms are used, how much can the CT dose be reduced while retaining the image quality of a standard-dose CT produced by the conventional FBP?  This R15 project provides Weber State University (WSU) computer engineering and computer science students with hands-on opportunities and experiences of performing real-world research in the field of healthcare. It will stimulate the interests of students so that they consider a career in biomedical and bioengineering field/industry. Narrative:  CT dose is currently a major concern for the general public. Low-dose CT is under development. The proposed research will focus on developing fast, robust and practical image reconstruction methods that are able to produce a standard CT image using a lower CT dose.",Fast and Robust Low-Dose X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction,9440734,R15EB024283,"['Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cadaver', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collimator', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equus caballus', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Internships', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'parallel computer', 'professor', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'tomography', 'university student']",NIBIB,WEBER STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2018,88321,0.1008836770525689
"System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion Summary BioInVision, Inc. and Case Western Reserve University researchers will develop software for quantitative anal- ysis of cardiac CT perfusion (CCTP), creating an important tool for evaluation of cardiovascular disease. With this product, cardiologists will be able to identify functional flow deficits in coronary artery territories. When one combines functional myocardial blood flow (MBF) with coronary anatomy from computed tomography angi- ography (CTA), it provides needed information on the physiologic significance of a stenosis. The CTA+CCTP combo could provide an ideal gateway exam for deciding whether to send a patient for percutaneous invasive coronary angiography and potential intervention (e.g., stenting). In addition, if flow is low and no stenosis is present, it will suggest microvascular disease, a very prevalent ailment of growing concern, especially among women and in diabetes. CT compares favorably to all other non-invasive cardiovascular imaging techniques (SPECT, PET, and MRI). It is available in many settings, including emergency departments. It provides both MBF and reliable coronary anatomy, not available in any other single modality. It has excellent resolution ena- bling detection of endocardial perfusion deficit, thought to be an early disease indicator that is impossible to assess with SPECT. CT is cheaper and has higher patient throughput than MRI or PET. With inclusion of MBF, CT would have an excellent opportunity to disrupt the diagnostic pathway leading to percutaneous intervention, a pathway now dominated by SPECT myocardial imaging, which includes zero information about coronary anatomy. To achieve reliable, accurate CT MBF measurements, we will invoke innovations to reduce beam hardening and to make reliable estimates of flow. Currently, CT perfusion is done on different CT machines with manufacturers’ proprietary software, using algorithms that can give erroneous MBFs. Applicable to any commercial scanner; our solution would harmonize measurements across acquisition systems providing trust- worthy, standardized measurements to clinicians, thereby improving management of cardiovascular patients. Narrative We will develop software to enable reliable evaluation of blood flow in heart tissue using CT imaging. With suc- cess, our project could lead to an improved gateway examination that could reduce unnecessary invasive cor- onary angiography, thereby reducing costs, patient discomfort, patient risk, and possibly unnecessary interven- tional therapies.",System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion,9622204,R41HL144271,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Attention', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary artery', 'Cost Savings', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Family suidae', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inferior', 'Intervention', 'Iodine', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardium', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Stents', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'blood flow measurement', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'perfusion imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,"BIOINVISION, INC.",R41,2018,224240,0.007094218827311367
"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9336855,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,347700,0.13623444606780827
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9268035,R01HL122484,"['3D ultrasound', '4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'perfusion imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,770494,0.0863670608896659
"Development of automated web-based spectroscopic MRI clinical interface Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Infiltration of glioma cells into surrounding normal brain make curative surgical resection of GBM impossible, and almost all will eventually recur. Thus, extraordinary significance is placed on radiation therapy (RT) strategies, which have been shown to be effective, but require strong imaging evidence to guide RT planning. Currently employed clinical imaging modalities include T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI, which only identifies leaky neovasculature associated with high grade tumor, and T2-weighted MRI, which is not specific for tumor infiltration. Through advances in neurosurgery, it is now possible to achieve complete or near-complete resection of the CE tumor component in many cases; thus, the region that is treated with the highest RT dose is limited to the empty resection cavity plus a small margin. Due to the generally larger size of the T2 area and unknown status of disease, it is treated to a lesser “microscopic disease” dose. Many times, however, this microscopic disease dose is inadequate to control the tumor. Spectroscopic MR imaging (sMRI) provides a highly sensitive and specific means of identifying these regions, although sMRI has not yet seen use in RT planning due to a lack of clinical decision support software for the analysis, display, and management of sMRI data. Three key hurdles to be overcome are: 1) lack of an automatic, fast and reliable method for spectral quality control; 2) the necessity of quantification of metabolite levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism; and 3) a clinician- friendly display of the sMRI spectra encoded as a high-resolution, continuous, 3D image set for direct registration and incorporation into the RT planning process. Currently, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and shepherding data between several tools, resulting in a complex workflow that takes hours and is impractical for routine use in a fast-paced clinical RT environment. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to radiation oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in RT planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning. Specifically, we will develop algorithmic filters for identifying (and eliminating) spectral artifacts, algorithms for personalized localization of tumor infiltration, and methods and interfaces for the volumetric display of sMRI data needed for RT planning and review. Success in the proposed work will produce an automated “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into routine clinical applications. This tool will also be highly valuable in the MRS-based diagnosis and evaluation of numerous other neuropathologies, including other primary (and metastatic) brain tumors, stroke, multiple sclerosis (and other demyelinating diseases), inborn errors of metabolism, and neurodegenerative diseases. Project Narrative There is widespread agreement that MR spectroscopy can provide valuable information without the need for exogenous contrast agents, however the software tools needed to incorporate whole brain 3D spectroscopic MRI (sMRI) into clinical practice are lacking. We plan to develop a web-based sMRI clinical interface for the analysis, visualization and integration of sMRI data into patient management. This “scanner-to-clinician” platform is designed to provide quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis in order to integrate sMRI into the routine radiation therapy planning process. In addition, this user-friendly tool will be highly valuable in the sMRI-based diagnosis and evaluation of numerous other neuropathologies aside from cancer, including other primary (and metastatic) brain tumors, stroke, multiple sclerosis (and other demyelinating diseases), inborn errors of metabolism, and neurodegenerative diseases.",Development of automated web-based spectroscopic MRI clinical interface,9332618,R21NS100244,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'High-LET Radiation', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Inborn Errors of Metabolism', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Surgically-Created Resection Cavity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Water', 'Work', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'expectation', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'neovasculature', 'neuropathology', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,233258,-0.0013737867075422222
"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body.

"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians.  Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9186673,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,347254,0.13623444606780827
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning.

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.

In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display.

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more.

"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread.

In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans.

"Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. A patient's five-year survival rate depend on the tumor stage at the time of diagnosis, and stage of the tumor plays a substantial role in decision-making regarding treatment. Thus, precise pre-treatment diagnostic evaluation and staging of colorectal cancer are important. In addition, angiogenesis plays an important role in the process of growth and metastasis in CRC and is reported as a useful prognostic marker, similar to many other carcinomas. Thus, in vivo quantification of the tumor angiogenesis rate holds promise in improving the management of CRC. Perfusion computed tomography (PCT) acquires high temporal resolution images, thus enabling evaluation of hemodynamic changes of tissue in vivo by modeling tracer kinetics. PCT has been reported to characterize tumor angiogenesis, and to be a more sensitive imaging biomarker for predicting of overall survival (OS) of CRC patients than conventional tumor staging. In clinical practice, however, the PCT protocol is a trade-off between high-temporal resolution and the total radiation dose required. Thus, the use of dynamic CT imaging derived from four temporal phases, which include pre-contrast, arterial, portal, and delayed phases, is highly desirable, because it is more readily available and yields substantially lower radiation exposure to the patients than that of PCT. However, low temporal resolution in four-phase dynamic CT presents several barriers in modeling tracer kinetics, primarily because of the lack of temporal enhancement information, which limits the ability to obtain reliable physiological information. We will thus develop a novel continuous-time modeling of tracer kinetics without any discretization of the enhancement curves. Such an approach will enable estimation of the time lag between onset time points of input and response enhancements as well as other kinetic parameters in four-phase dynamic CT. We hypothesize that the proposed tracer kinetic model can be an effective imaging biomarker for the risk stratification of recurrence of CRC and for prediction of OS. To explore these hypotheses, the specific aims of the proposed project are (1) Develop a novel single-input continuous-time tracer kinetic model without any discretization to fit temporal enhancement curves in four-phase dynamic CT of the colon, and (2) develop kinetic-model-based imaging biomarkers from four-phase dynamic CT and evaluate their performance in predicting clinical outcome in CRC patients. Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient.

"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician. This proposal describes a new, automatic method for treatment plan optimization that is very fast, requiring only minutes to produce a plan that directly meets all the physician's constraints, potentially saving much time for a busy clinic.

"Decision support for dose prescription in radiation treatment planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent advances in radiation therapy [1], such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT), offer the ability to maximize tumor control while reducing the risk of radiation-induced damage to adjacent normal tissue. Typically, radiation therapy involves three phases: (1) prescription - where radiation oncologists (physicians) specify the dose constraints for targets and organs at risk (OAR); (2) planning - where treatment planners (physicists, dosimetrists) determine the treatment parameters to achieve the prescribed dose constraints; and (3) treatment - where therapists carry out the plan to treat the patients. In current practice, radiation oncologists typically draw on a variety of sources for dose prescription, including the 1991 ""Emami"" paper [8] on normal tissue tolerance, updated guidance from QUANTEC, other data in journals and texts, and their personal experiences. While these provide a general understanding of the dependence of normal tissue complication on dose distribution or the upper limits of the organ tolerance in populations of patients, their application to an individual patient is less certain and precise. Application of data and guidelines that are available in the literature is further complicated by the fact that this information is available only as narrative texts, tables and charts that are difficult to quantitatively integrate into clinical practice. Furthermore, the existing guidelines do not consider patient specific information regarding the ideal dose distribution achievable at individual treatments [9]. Radiation oncologists are frequently forced to make difficult prescription decisions by synthesizing available population level guidelines, personal experience, and their understanding of the specific patient needs on an ad hoc basis. Our overarching goal is to improve outcome by providing evidence-based decision support for radiation oncologists, planners, and therapists in every phase of the treatment process. In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient- specific optimal dose constraints. The specific aims are (1) Provide radiation oncologists with reliable predictions of patient-specific dose distributions achievable for the patient's anatomy and tumor volume; and (2) Provide radiation oncologists with intuitive tools that integrate patient-specific dose predictions with population-based dose guidelines to support prescription decision making. We believe the technologies developed in this project will not only improve the quality of radiotherapy prescriptions but also reduce planning time with optimal dose constraints and improve clinical outcomes.         In this project we propose to develop practical and clinically useful decision support tools to help radiation oncologists prescribe patient-specific optimal dose constraints.

"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.            ",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,8439269,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Endoscopy', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2013,306421,0.17592033961564996
"Spatially Accurate Deformable Image Registration for Thoracic C Applications    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant)   Abstract:  Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cross-cutting technology with diagnostic and therapeutic medical applications. DIR algorithms were first developed in computer vision research to estimate motion between a source and target image, the resulting registered image visually appears similar to the target image. For medical applications the goal in applying DIR is to obtain an accurate spatial registration of the underlying anatomy and not simply image similarity. We developed a statistical framework for quantitative evaluation of DIR spatial accuracy based on large samples of expert-determined landmark features. Central to this framework is the statistical relationship between the number of landmark points required to assess spatial accuracy, the desired uncertainty range of the mean error, and an a priori estimated behavior of the DIR. DIR is at the heart of our strategy to quantify COPD small airway disease air-trapping and four dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) ventilation. The optimal DIR algorithm and its spatial accuracy in registering the underlying anatomy should be assessed for each application. We will develop and test new DIR algorithms for exhale and inhale breath-hold CT (eBH-CT & iBH-CT) images pairs (COPD air trapping evaluation) and for 4D CT images (4D CT ventilation). Current CT image analysis methods for COPD evaluation focus on the separate anatomic evaluation of the eBH-CT & iBH-CT images. They are unable to find air-trapping due to bronchiolitis alone. We propose to evaluate the eBH- & iBH CT image pairs simultaneously using DIR to link the two to identify regions of air-trapping due to both emphysema and bronchiolitis. Next, to continue our development of ventilation imaging derived from 4D CT, we will test the ability of 4D CT ventilation image guidance to reduce pulmonary function loss after radiotherapy in a randomized phase II trial for non-small cell lung cancer patients.    Public Health Relevance:  This study will develop novel image registration methods and their application, with an emphasis on application specific validation. With this technology we will develop and test methods to find air-trapping in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. We will test our novel ventilation imaging method in radiation treatment planning to reduce normal lung injury after treatment for lung cancer.      ",Spatially Accurate Deformable Image Registration for Thoracic C Applications,8558551,DP2OD007044,"['4D Imaging', 'Aftercare', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Breathing', 'Bronchiolitis', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Exhalation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Link', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Patients', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Vision research', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abstracting', 'base', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'pulmonary function', 'small airways disease', 'treatment planning']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,DP2,2013,201518,0.06470973365757533
"High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Computerized planning for radiation delivery via either external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity- modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from linear accelerators is a complex process involving a large amount of input data and vast numbers of decision variables. Such large-scale combinatorial optimization problems are typically intractable for conventional approaches such as the direct application of the best available commercial algorithms, and thus specialized methods that take advantage of problem structure are required. Radiation treatment planning (RTP) problems are further complicated by the fact that they are multi-objective, that is, the RTP optimization process must take into account a trade-off between the competing goals of delivering appropriate doses to the tumor and avoiding the delivery of harmful radiation to nearby healthy organs. The goal of this proposal is to harness distributive computing via the Condor system for High Throughput Computing (HTC) within an RTP environment. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) To develop a Nested Partitions (NP) framework that guides a global search process for optimal IMRT delivery parameters using HTC. 2) To develop parallel HTC-based linear programming (LP) methods to efficiently solve the dose optimization problem in IMRT for each given set of beam angles or beam apertures. (3) To exploit a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment and the developed NP/LP/segmentation framework to efficiently generate multiple plans for each given patient case. (4) To couple this multi-plan framework with a decision support system (DSS) that includes planning surface models, a graphical-user-interface (GUI) and machine learning tools to prediction OAR complication in order to aid in the ranking and selection of the generated treatment plans. This proposal requires a multi-disciplinary approach that is best conducted within the framework of the Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology program announcement.

"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician.

"Robust BCT for Clinical Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for over 50% of the population over age 50. Despite its importance, osteoporosis is largely under-treated, with less than 20% of those recommended for testing being screened. With substantial reimbursement cuts being introduced by Medicare for bone densitometry by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, the current clinical standard), with a sensitivity of DXA for fracture prediction of less than 50%, and with the rapidly increasing size of the aging population of the U.S., there is an urgent need for additional and more sensitive modalities than DXA for clinical assessment of fracture risk. Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) has emerged as a powerful alternative to DXA. This CT-based technology creates a structural ""finite element"" model of a patient's bone from their CT scans, and subjects that model to virtual forces in order to provide an estimate of the strength of the bone. Well validated in cadaver studies and being a better predictor of bone strength than is bone mineral density by DXA, BCT has also been shown to be highly predictive of osteoporotic fractures in clinical research studies. However, robustness remains an issue - can the technique be used easily by non-experts in research and clinical environments? Addressing this issue, the overall goal of this research is to improve the robustness of our software, such that it can automatically analyze scans from a wide range of CT scanners and using a wide variety of CT acquisition protocols, including new low-dose protocols that limit radiation exposure to the patient. Such a robust BCT diagnostic tool could then be offered as a supplementary ""add-on"" analysis to many types of CT exams taken for other purposes such as CT colonography, pelvic, abdominal, and spine exams, thus reducing hospital costs, incurring no addition radiation to the patient, requiring no change in the CT acquisition protocols, and therefore greatly increasing the number of patients that could be screened at low cost. Specifically, we propose in this Phase-I project to combine expertise in computer vision, CT scanning, and biomechanics in order to develop an automated method of ""phantomless"" cross-calibration of CT scans for robust vertebral strength assessment. Focusing on the spine, our major tasks are to perform a series of clinical studies in which patients are scanned twice using a variety of CT acquisition protocols; develop a custom external-calibration phantom and use that to determine the effects of various CT acquisition parameters on scanning standardization; and use machine learning techniques to develop a ""statistical atlas"" of the spine for automation of all image processing. We will combine these efforts to develop a phantomless BCT method that accounts for differences in image quality due to variations in CT scanners and acquisition protocols, including low-dose protocols, and that does so in a highly automated fashion requiring minimal user expertise and input. Should this project be successful, future work will further refine the techniques, extend them to the hip and quantitative analysis of muscle and other soft tissues, and address robustness of longitudinal changes for clinical monitoring.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing. Early identification of those at risk for fracture can guide prevention and treatment, and BCT will provide a means for such detection with a sensitivity and specificity lacking in DXA based bone densitometry. The greater radiation exposure from CT, however, limits the market for such a diagnostic. The proposed project will result in a robust diagnostic test that significantly lowers radiation dose to the patient, and in some implementations, completely eliminates additional radiation by using CT scans already ordered for other medical purposes. Successful development of this product will broaden the pool of individuals who will benefit from a more accurate and sensitive fracture risk prediction, expand the market for O. N. Diagnostics' business, and result in an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.           Statement of Relevance With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing.

"High-Throughput Computing for a Multi-Plan Framework in Radiotherapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Computerized planning for radiation delivery via either external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity- modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from linear accelerators is a complex process involving a large amount of input data and vast numbers of decision variables. Such large-scale combinatorial optimization problems are typically intractable for conventional approaches such as the direct application of the best available commercial algorithms, and thus specialized methods that take advantage of problem structure are required. Radiation treatment planning (RTP) problems are further complicated by the fact that they are multi-objective, that is, the RTP optimization process must take into account a trade-off between the competing goals of delivering appropriate doses to the tumor and avoiding the delivery of harmful radiation to nearby healthy organs. The goal of this proposal is to harness distributive computing via the Condor system for High Throughput Computing (HTC) within an RTP environment. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) To develop a Nested Partitions (NP) framework that guides a global search process for optimal IMRT delivery parameters using HTC. 2) To develop parallel HTC-based linear programming (LP) methods to efficiently solve the dose optimization problem in IMRT for each given set of beam angles or beam apertures. (3) To exploit a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment and the developed NP/LP/segmentation framework to efficiently generate multiple plans for each given patient case. (4) To couple this multi-plan framework with a decision support system (DSS) that includes planning surface models, a graphical-user-interface (GUI) and machine learning tools to prediction OAR complication in order to aid in the ranking and selection of the generated treatment plans. This proposal requires a multi-disciplinary approach that is best conducted within the framework of the Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology program announcement.

"Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization for Rapid IMRT and VMAT Treatment Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has revolutionized the treatment of cancers in the last decade, since it can tightly conform and escalate radiation dose to a tumor while simultaneously protecting nearby radiation- sensitive normal tissues, resulting in better local control and fewer post-treatment complications than previous techniques. However, the process of obtaining a clinically acceptable IMRT plan for a difficult site is still extremely slow, requiring many hours of a busy expert's time in a manual trial-and-error loop of parameter adjustment. The goal of this project is to drastically reduce the amount of time to obtain a clinically acceptable IMRT plan using a new automated method that directly applies constrained optimization in a computationally tractable and clinically meaningful way. The hypothesis is that clinical treatment planning times using this technique will be reduced from several hours to a matter of minutes.  The new approach, called ROCO (Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization) translates well-established concepts from optimization and machine learning theory to the novel application of IMRT planning, exploiting the speed and ease of unconstrained optimizations and introducing a dimensionality reduction step that makes true constrained optimization tractable. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to (1) apply Reduced-Order Con- strained Optimization to IMRT planning for non-small cell lung cancers and nasopharynx cancers, where the planning process is highly time-consuming; (2) develop and extend the Reduced-Order Constrained Optimization paradigm to a promising IMRT variant called Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for the prostate site, which is currently nearly clinically intractable to plan; and (3) integrate the new tools into the clinical IMRT planning process at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, using a powered study to verify the hypothesis that the proposed method significantly improves planning speed. The experiments will be designed in consultation with an expert clinical treatment planner and biostatistician, and carefully validated using anonymized data from approximately 50 patients for each site.  The main benefit of the proposed approach is to drastically reduce planning times, which is critical if IMRT and VMAT are to reach their full potential in clinical application. In a busy clinic, long planning times place a severe stress on available resources, and can result in treatment delays, acceptance of sub-optimal plans or - in the worst case - errors due to time pressure. In the longer term, the proposed approach will provide deeper insight into the critical elements of the dose optimization problem, significantly reduce the trial-and-error effort characteristic of current IMRT planning, and reduce subjectivity in treatment plan selection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician. This proposal describes a new, automatic method for treatment plan optimization that is very fast, requiring only minutes to produce a plan that directly meets all the physician's constraints, potentially saving much time for a busy clinic.           Project Narrative Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an extremely promising cancer treatment, but currently requires many hours of an expert treatment planner's time to obtain a plan that meets all the clinical constraints specified by the physician.

"Spatially Accurate Deformable Image Registration for Thoracic CT Application    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant)   Abstract:  Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cross-cutting technology with diagnostic and therapeutic medical applications. DIR algorithms were first developed in computer vision research to estimate motion between a source and target image, the resulting registered image visually appears similar to the target image. For medical applications the goal in applying DIR is to obtain an accurate spatial registration of the underlying anatomy and not simply image similarity. We developed a statistical framework for quantitative evaluation of DIR spatial accuracy based on large samples of expert-determined landmark features. Central to this framework is the statistical relationship between the number of landmark points required to assess spatial accuracy, the desired uncertainty range of the mean error, and an a priori estimated behavior of the DIR. DIR is at the heart of our strategy to quantify COPD small airway disease air-trapping and four dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) ventilation. The optimal DIR algorithm and its spatial accuracy in registering the underlying anatomy should be assessed for each application. We will develop and test new DIR algorithms for exhale and inhale breath-hold CT (eBH-CT & iBH-CT) images pairs (COPD air trapping evaluation) and for 4D CT images (4D CT ventilation). Current CT image analysis methods for COPD evaluation focus on the separate anatomic evaluation of the eBH-CT & iBH-CT images. They are unable to find air-trapping due to bronchiolitis alone. We propose to evaluate the eBH- & iBH CT image pairs simultaneously using DIR to link the two to identify regions of air-trapping due to both emphysema and bronchiolitis. Next, to continue our development of ventilation imaging derived from 4D CT, we will test the ability of 4D CT ventilation image guidance to reduce pulmonary function loss after radiotherapy in a randomized phase II trial for non-small cell lung cancer patients.   Public Health Relevance:  This study will develop novel image registration methods and their application, with an emphasis on application specific validation. With this technology we will develop and test methods to find air-trapping in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. We will test our novel ventilation imaging method in radiation treatment planning to reduce normal lung injury after treatment for lung cancer.       n/a",Spatially Accurate Deformable Image Registration for Thoracic CT Application,7980382,DP2OD007044,"['Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Breathing', 'Bronchiolitis', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Exhalation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Link', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision research', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abstracting', 'base', 'image registration', 'pulmonary function', 'small airways disease']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,DP2,2010,1645038,0.06943425223606062
"Robust BCT for Clinical Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for over 50% of the population over age 50. Despite its importance, osteoporosis is largely under-treated, with less than 20% of those recommended for testing being screened. With substantial reimbursement cuts being introduced by Medicare for bone densitometry by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, the current clinical standard), with a sensitivity of DXA for fracture prediction of less than 50%, and with the rapidly increasing size of the aging population of the U.S., there is an urgent need for additional and more sensitive modalities than DXA for clinical assessment of fracture risk. Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) has emerged as a powerful alternative to DXA. This CT-based technology creates a structural ""finite element"" model of a patient's bone from their CT scans, and subjects that model to virtual forces in order to provide an estimate of the strength of the bone. Well validated in cadaver studies and being a better predictor of bone strength than is bone mineral density by DXA, BCT has also been shown to be highly predictive of osteoporotic fractures in clinical research studies. However, robustness remains an issue - can the technique be used easily by non-experts in research and clinical environments? Addressing this issue, the overall goal of this research is to improve the robustness of our software, such that it can automatically analyze scans from a wide range of CT scanners and using a wide variety of CT acquisition protocols, including new low-dose protocols that limit radiation exposure to the patient. Such a robust BCT diagnostic tool could then be offered as a supplementary ""add-on"" analysis to many types of CT exams taken for other purposes such as CT colonography, pelvic, abdominal, and spine exams, thus reducing hospital costs, incurring no addition radiation to the patient, requiring no change in the CT acquisition protocols, and therefore greatly increasing the number of patients that could be screened at low cost.

"AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 1 million people in the US will experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease (ischemia), which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently there is no reliable screening method to identify people who may have silent heart disease and therefore are at risk of ""heart attack"".       We seek to extract additional data from a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart (commonly used in most imaging centers), which will better identify patients who are ""vulnerable"" to sudden heart attack. These images are acquired without contrast agents, as a common screening test for measuring coronary calcium, another clinical marker of coronary artery disease. We will prove that additional information about cardiovascular risk can be obtained by quantifying pericardial fat surrounding the heart in these cardiac CT images. Although this information exists in the cardiac CT scans acquired today, it is ignored in clinical practice because currently there are no tools to measure it automatically and reliably, and no information regarding its significance for a given patient.       We will develop fully automated, accurate, new computer software for quantitation of pericardial fat from cardiac CT images acquired for routine assessment of coronary calcium. We plan to achieve complete automation and accuracy, by applying a combination of robust and effective algorithms in machine learning with anatomical knowledge. We aim to prove that the developed automatic software will be as accurate, and more reproducible than experienced imaging physicians in quantifying pericardial fat, and will accomplish the measurement in a fraction of the time. Such software could be immediately made available worldwide to standard imaging workstations. For the first time, this will allow its use as a standard practical imaging tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, without requiring additional time, imaging or radiation risk to the patient.       We will also show that this new quantitative information has important additional value compared to other clinical cardiovascular risk factors and information from blood samples (such as cholesterol, glucose and CRP), and the amount of calcium in the patient's coronary arteries seen on CT scans, and establish its significance in the prediction of silent heart disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This new research will allow accurate prediction of who might be more likely to have heart disease which may ultimately cause a heart attack. It will allow doctors to identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed to avoid a heart attack, or more extensive testing, could be recommended, to confirm or rule out heart disease.          n/a",AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR,7588839,R21EB006829,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Blood specimen', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Pericardial body location', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'indexing', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'waist circumference']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2009,196375,0.04920386216056326

For the first time, this will allow its use as a standard practical imaging tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, without requiring additional time, imaging or radiation risk to the patient.       We will also show that this new quantitative information has important additional value compared to other clinical cardiovascular risk factors and information from blood samples (such as cholesterol, glucose and CRP), and the amount of calcium in the patient's coronary arteries seen on CT scans, and establish its significance in the prediction of silent heart disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This new research will allow accurate prediction of who might be more likely to have heart disease which may ultimately cause a heart attack. It will allow doctors to identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed to avoid a heart attack, or more extensive testing, could be recommended, to confirm or rule out heart disease.          n/a",AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR,7470355,R21EB006829,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Blood specimen', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Invasive', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Pericardial body location', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cysteine rich protein', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'human FAT protein', 'indexing', 'novel', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'waist circumference']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2008,245025,0.04920386216056326
"Biosurveillance Utilizing SNOMED-CT Based Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals.

"Accelerated x-ray therapy planning system PEREGRINE DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computerized radiation therapy planning systems (RTP) are essential in Radiation Oncology for quantitative evaluation of radiation doses prior to patient treatment. Among currently available computational methods, the Monte Carlo method of calculating dose distributionsis most universal and accurate. It is believed that Monte Carlo software packages will become a central part of future RTP systems. The limiting problem with current Monte Carlo codes is the length of time (CPU time) required for calculations even when using state-of-the-art hardware. An increase in efficiency of Monte Carlo codes has been demonstrated using algorithms known as variance-reduction techniques (VR techniques), but the calculation times are still too long for routine  clinical use. While there is no single VR technique that would make Monte Carlo code clinically viable, a combination of such techniques usually results in improved performance. At present, the only commercial RTP system using Monte Carlo code for photon dose calculations is PEREGRINE from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NOMOS Corporation. PEREGRINE uses several VR techniques. However, it is estimated that a further reduction in CPU time by a factor of 10 would be required to have a clinically efficient system.  Our theoretical study and subsequent Monte Carlo results support a new variance-reduction technique (NVR) for photon-beam dose calculations. It is shown that NVR yields up to a 5-fold reduction in CPU time. The long-term objective of the project is to reduce PEREGRIN's CPU time from currently several hours to several; minutes. This will require a combination of NVR with other VR techniques. Within this scope, the specific aims of Phase I are:  1. Development, implementation and validation of a PEREGRINE-specific NVR algorithm.  2. Benchmarking of NVR over the range of clinically useful energies in homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms.  3. Validation of NVR in the case of patient-specific Monte Carlo calculations using CT based patient anatomy. n/a",Accelerated x-ray therapy planning system PEREGRINE,6787955,R41CA108088,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'computed axial tomography', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'electromagnetic radiation', 'mathematics', 'patient care planning', 'radiation dosage', 'radiation therapy', 'technology /technique development']",NCI,NOMOS CORPORATION,R41,2004,100000,0.11372784294452438

"TOPIC 389 - INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING Besides surgery, radiotherapy is the most effective treatment modality for localized prostate cancer. The success of radiotherapy stems from the exploit of a therapeutic window in tumor response and normal tissue tolerance which maximizes the chance of sterilizing the tumor while sparing the surrounding normal tissue from severe damage. This requires an accurate and individualized radiation dose distribution generated from the examination of the patient’s medical images. Radiation therapy is technically complex and labor intensive. Intensive human supervision and intervention are needed throughout the path of patient care.   Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are adept at automating workflows and tasks—in this case the development of cancer treatment plans. We believe that this machine learning has incredible potential to address inherent problems in the existing treatment planning workflow. Our approach will mitigate the current issues with treatment planning, integrate seamlessly with day-to-day operations, and will serve as a treatment solution that benefits patients in a way that limits their risk and extends their lives.   The goal of this project is to develop a start-to-end prostate cancer treatment planning system. We will work with three expert radiation oncology teams to archive existing patient data for use in training of artificial intelligence algorithms. These algorithms will enable high quality plans to be generated with ease.

"Automatic Organ Segmentation Tool for Radiation Treatment Planning of Cancers ABSTRACT As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention, which is critical in reducing long term toxicity of cancers. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to organs-at-risk (OARs), OARs need to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans during radiation treatment planning to get an accurate dose distribution. Despite tremendous effort in developing semi- or fully-automatic segmentation solutions, current automated segmentation software, mostly using the atlas-based methods, has not yet reached the level of accuracy and robustness required for clinical usage. Therefore, in current practice, significant manual efforts are still required in the OAR segmentation process. Manual contouring suffers from inter- and intra-observer variability, as well as institutional variability where different sites adopt distinct contouring atlases and labeling criteria, thus leading to inaccuracy and variability in OAR segmentation. When OARs are very close to the treatment target, segmentation errors as small as a few millimeters can have a statistically significant impact on dosimetry distribution and outcome. In addition, it is also costly and time consuming as it can take 1-2 hours of a clinicians’ time to segment major thoracic organs due to the large number of axial slices required. In summary, an accurate and fast process for segmenting OARs in treatment planning using CT scans is needed for improving patient outcomes and reducing the cost of radiation therapy of cancers. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning methods has revolutionized many computer-vision areas and the adoption of deep learning in medical applications has shown great success. Based on a deep-learning-based algorithm we developed that achieved better-than-human performance and ranked 1st in 2017 American Association of Physicist in Medicine Thoracic Auto-segmentation Challenge, an automatic OAR segmentation product will be developed in this project with the three aims: 1) further improve the performance and robustness of OAR segmentation algorithms, focusing on addressing the heterogeneity issue of different clinical environments; 2) further enrich the functionalities and enhance usability of the cloud- based software product; and 3) perform clinical validation study on the algorithm performance and software usability at collaborating sites. With this product, the segmentation accuracy can be improved, leading to more robust treatment plans in protecting normal organs and improved long term patient outcome. The time and cost of radiation treatment planning can be greatly reduced, contributing to a more affordable cancer treatment and reduced healthcare burden. NARRATIVE As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to such organs-at-risk (OARs), they are required to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans. A deep-learning-based automatic OAR segmentation product developed in this project can improve the segmentation accuracy and reduce the time and cost of radiation treatment planning as compared with the current manual process, leading to improved long term patient outcome and reduced cancer treatment cost.",Automatic Organ Segmentation Tool for Radiation Treatment Planning of Cancers,10081752,R44CA254844,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Body Regions', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Cost', 'Update', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'dosimetry', 'healthcare community', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'life-long learning', 'millimeter', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'prototype', 'satisfaction', 'segmentation algorithm', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NCI,"CARINA MEDICAL, LLC",R44,2020,1000000,0.1346885923899236
"Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY About 2/3 of cancer patients in US receive radiation therapy either alone or in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. Treatment planning, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, is analogous to the design of a blueprint for building construction. If a treatment plan is poorly designed, the desired treatment outcome cannot be achieved, no matter how well other components of radiation therapy are performed. In the current clinical workflow, a treatment planner works towards a good quality plan in a trial-and-error fashion. Many rounds of consultation between the planner and physician are needed to reach a plan of physician's satisfaction, because physician's preference for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and precisely conveyed to the planner. Consequently, planning time can be up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor and can vary significantly due to varying levels of physician and planner's skills and physician-planner cooperation, etc., which substantially deteriorates treatment outcomes. For example, head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with suboptimal plans present 20% lower 2-year overall survival and 24% higher 2-year local-regional failure. Prolonged overall treatment process due to treatment planning reduces local-regional control rate by 12–14% per week. Furthermore, as patient's anatomy can rapidly change within the planning time, the optimally designed plan becomes inappropriate for the changed anatomy. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made colossal advancements. We believe that AI technologies have a great potential to revolutionize treatment planning. Treatment planning consists of two major aspects: commonality and individuality. By exploiting the commonality through deep supervised learning, we can develop a treatment plan as good as those for previously treated similar patients. The individuality can be actualized by learning physician's special considerations for a particular patient using deep reinforcement learning. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of these ideas. We hypothesize that an AI-based intelligent treatment planning system can consistently produce high-quality treatment plans with extremely high efficiency. This hypothesis will be tested using H&N cancer patients as a test bed via two aims. Aim 1, System development. Develop two deep-learning models to realize the proposed treatment planning workflow and incorporate them into a clinical environment. Aim 2, System validation. Acquire and analyze planning data before and after system implementation. The innovation of this project is the use and customization of the state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve a clinically important problem. These technologies would revolutionize treatment planning process, leading to the efficient generation of consistently high quality plans, irrespective of human skills, experiences, and communications, etc. Besides the significance demonstrated for the H&N cancer patients, the system can be easily extended to other tumor sites, yielding more substantial impacts. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal and varying quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes.

"Cardiac CT Deblooming PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 Americans annu- ally2. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive method widely employed for diagnosis of CAD and planning therapeutic interventions. With the current CT technology, calcium blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment. Similarly, stent blooming artifacts lead to overestimation of in-stent restenosis. As a result, many coronary CT angiography (CCTA) scans are non-diagnostic and result in patients receiving costly and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) procedures.  Based on extensive feasibility results, the goal of this project is to use deep learning innovations to fundamen- tally eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware. A consortium between GE Re- search, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Weill Cornell Medicine will develop dedicated imaging protocols and machine learning methods to avoid or minimize blooming artifacts and evaluate the clinical impact of the proposed solutions. In Aim 1, the CT scan protocol will be optimized and paired with deep learning reconstruc- tion and post-processing algorithms to generate high-resolution CT images and prevent blooming artifacts. In Aim 2, image-domain and raw-data-domain deep learning processing algorithms will be developed to correct for residual blooming. After successful demonstration of the proposed methods on phantom scans and emulated clinical datasets, in Aim 3 the proposed CT methods will be clinically demonstrated and optimized based on 100 patients with coronary artery disease, using intravascular ultrasound as the ground-truth reference.  At the end of the project, we will have demonstrated and publicly disseminated a systematic methodology to essentially remove blooming artifacts in cardiac CT without a costly hardware upgrade. This will be another suc- cess of deep learning, enabling accurate coronary stenosis assessment and eliminating many unnecessary diag- nostic catheterizations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment with cardiac CT, leading to un- necessary invasive coronary angiography procedures. The goal of this project is to eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware, but based on optimized scan protocols and deep-learning-based image reconstruction and post-processing techniques. The proposed CT methods will be clinically demonstrated and optimized based on CT scans of 100 patients with coronary artery disease and using intravascular ultrasound as the ground-truth reference.",Cardiac CT Deblooming,9943684,R01HL151561,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Calcium', 'Caliber', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Plant Roots', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'Stenosis', 'Stents', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'calcification', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'diagnostic catheterization', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'machine learning method', 'man', 'microCT', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'restenosis', 'simulation', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'virtual', 'virtual reality simulation']",NHLBI,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,R01,2020,900092,0.060273277268474874
"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,10003010,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'prostate radiotherapy', 'random forest', 'segmentation algorithm', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,315338,0.13623444606780827
"Automated acute pulmonary embolism detection and staging from CT Project Summary / Abstract Minnesota HealthSolutions (MHS) proposes a Phase I project to develop and validate a software product capable of automatically detecting and staging pulmonary embolisms (PEs) using clinically routine pulmonary CT angiograms (CTAs). The proposed system will combine state-of-the-art machine learning methods and the clinical expertise of MEDNAX Radiology into a system that integrates seamlessly into the Radiology workflow and standard patient care path to improve the treatment decisions of physicians in the emergency department. Pulmonary embolism is the third most common cause of death in hospital patients with an estimated incidence of 1 per 1,000 patients. CTAs are routinely used to detect PE today; however, there is significant variability in the detection rate among radiologists using CTA. Furthermore, despite the strong evidence that the RV/LV ratio is an important clinical biomarker it is rarely measured quantitatively in practice. A successful completion of this project would provide a workflow-integrated tool capable of faster PE detection and more accurate staging of right heart strain to guide the physician’s treatment decision.

"Task-aware and Autonomous Robotic C-arm Servoing for Flouroscopy-guided Interventions Project Summary Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is used in more than 17 million procedures across the US and constitutes the state-of-care for various percutaneous procedures, including internal ﬁxation of pelvic ring injuries. To infer procedural progress from 2D radiographs, well-deﬁned views onto anatomy must be achieved and restored multiple times during surgery. This process, known as ”ﬂuoro hunting”, is associated with 4.7 s of excessive ﬂuoroscopy time per C-arm position (c. f. 120 s total per ﬁxation), yielding radiographs that are never interpreted clinically, but drastically increasing procedure time and radiation dose to patient and surgical staff.  Our long-term project goal is to use concepts from machine learning and active vision to develop task-aware algorithms for autonomous robotic C-arm servoing that interpret intra-operative radiographs and autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to acquire ﬂuoroscopic images that are optimal for inference. We have three speciﬁc aims: 1) Detecting unfavorable K-wire trajectories from monoplane ﬂuoroscopy images: We will extend a physics-based sim- ulation framework for ﬂuoroscopy from CT that enables fast generation of structured and realistic radiographs documenting procedural progress. Based on this data, we will train a state-of-the-art convolutional neural net- work that interprets ﬂuoroscopic images to infer procedural progress. 2) Developing and validating a task-aware imaging system in silico: Using the autonomous interpretation tools and simulation pipeline available through Aim 1, we will train an artiﬁcial agent based on reinforcement learning and active vision. This agent will be capable of analyzing intra-operative ﬂuoroscopic images to autonomously adjust the C-arm pose to yield task- optimal views onto anatomy. 3) Demonstrating feasibility of our task-aware imaging concept ex vivo: Our third aim will establish task-aware C-arm imaging in controlled clinical environments. We will attempt internal ﬁxation of anterior pelvic ring fractures and our task-aware artiﬁcial agent will interpret intra-operatively acquired ra- diographs to infer procedural progress and suggest optimal C-arm poses that will be realized manually with an optically-tracked mobile C-arm system.  This work combines the expertise of a computer scientist, a surgical robotics expert, and an orthopedic trauma surgeon to explore the untapped, understudied area of autonomous imaging enabled by advances in machine learning in ﬂuoroscopy-guided procedures. This development has only recently been made feasible by innovations in fast ﬂuoroscopy simulation from CT to provide structured data for training that is sufﬁciently realistic to warrant generalization to clinical data. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to investigate autonomous and task-aware C-arm imaging systems, paving the way for a new paradigm in medical image acquisition, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients by task-oriented image acquisition on a patient-speciﬁc basis. Subsequent R01 funding will customize this concept to other high-volume procedures, such as vertebroplasty. Project Narrative Fluoroscopy guidance using C-arm X-ray systems is the state-of-care for percutaneous fracture ﬁxation, and requires surgeons to achieve and reproduce well deﬁned views onto anatomy to infer procedural progress. This requirement alone is estimated to contribute 4.7 s of ﬂuoroscopy time per C-arm repositioning (c. f. 120 s total per ﬁxation), drastically increasing procedure time and radiation dose to patient and surgical team. The goal of this project is to develop machine learning-based C-arm servoing algorithms that introduce task awareness by interpreting intra-operative radiographs and autonomously adjusting the C-arm pose to task-optimal views.",Task-aware and Autonomous Robotic C-arm Servoing for Flouroscopy-guided Interventions,9972122,R21EB028505,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Bladder', 'Cadaver', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Compression Fracture', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Expert Systems', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Fracture', 'Fracture Fixation', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Orthopedics', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scientist', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Width', 'Work', 'active vision', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm training', 'arm', 'base', 'bone', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'femoral artery', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved outcome', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'sample fixation', 'simulation', 'spine bone structure', 'structured data', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,193784,0.01679935743682053
"Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before heart attacks occur and is currently used to predict risk in millions of patients annually. Under the current grant, we have established a unique collaborative multicenter registry including over 23,000 imaging datasets (REFINE SPECT) with both prognostic (major adverse cardiovascular events) and diagnostic (invasive catheterization) outcomes. Using this registry, we have demonstrated that a combination of MPS image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) tools achieved superior predictive performance compared to visual assessment by experienced readers or current state-of-the-art quantitative techniques. In the renewal, we plan to expand REFINE SPECT with now-available enhanced datasets (adding CT and myocardial blood flow information) and leverage latest AI advances to provide a personalized decision support tool for patient-specific cardiovascular risk assessment and estimation of benefit from revascularization following MPS. The overall aim is to optimize the clinical capabilities of MPS in risk prediction and treatment guidance by integrating all available imaging and clinical data with state-of-the-art AI methods. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: (1) To expand and enhance our REFINE SPECT registry including CT and MPS flow data, (2) To develop fully automated techniques for all MPS and CT image analysis, (3) To apply explainable deep learning time-to-event AI models for optimal prediction of MACE and benefit from revascularization from all image and clinical data. This work will result in an immediately deployable clinical tool, which will optimally predict risk of adverse events and establish the relative benefits from specific therapies, beyond what is possible by subjective visual analysis and mental integration of all imaging (MPS, CT, flow), and clinical data by physicians. Such quantitative integrative methods are not yet available, leaving the current practice for assessing risk and recommending therapy highly subjective. The precise quantitative results will be presented to clinicians in easy to understand terms (e.g., % risk per year, or relative risk of one therapy vs. the alternative) for a specific patient. Additionally, our methods to make AI conclusions more tangible will improve adoption of this technology. All results will be derived fully automatically thus eliminating any variability. Our approach will fit into current MPS practice and will be immediately translatable to clinics worldwide. Most importantly, this research will allow patients to benefit from increased precision and accuracy in risk assessment, thereby optimizing the use of imaging in guiding patient management decisions and ultimately improving outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT is often used to predict who is at risk of heart attack and should undergo treatment such as coronary bypass or stenting; however, physicians read images visually and report results with wide variability. With the latest artificial intelligence tools and new types of imaging (including CT and fast SPECT scans), the investigators propose to develop and validate an automated clinical tool to optimize risk prediction and objectively establish the relative benefit of a specific therapy. This new tool will consider all available patient images and other relevant information to provide a personalized explanation and precise calculation of risk and potential benefits from therapy for each patient.",Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT,9888240,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Country', 'Cox Models', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'International', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Stents', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse event risk', 'attenuation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic', 'radiotracer', 'relating to nervous system', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'support tools', 'time use', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,808131,0.0335361883194192
"An Automated Patient Chart Error Detection System for Radiation Therapy Project Summary/Abstract Every year, approximately 1,200 severe mistreatments happen in radiation therapy. Radiation therapy lawsuits rank in the top third of all medical specialties with an average of $313,000 per claim settled or litigated. The current method for detecting treatment errors is by a weekly patient chart check, where each treatment record is manually reviewed on a weekly basis. This labor-intensive and inefficient method prevents us from detecting the treatment error at an early stage. Here we propose a novel software system, ChartAlert, for automating patient chart checking. ChartAlert is a prospective real-time adaptive electronic checking system that can be configured to support different clinical workflows and perform “smart” check using artificial intelligence. It supports two major treatment databases (Elekta MOSAIQ and Varian ARIA) in radiotherapy. In Phase I project, we have successfully developed ChartAlert for MOSAIQ prototype that is under clinical testing in two treatment centers. Our preliminary results demonstrated the significant improvement of effectiveness in patient chart checking and the flexibility of supporting different workflows. In this Phase II proposal, we will continue the ChartAlert development. We will demonstrate the feasibility of the ChartAlert approach and its advantages over the standard manual checking method. We will develop a prospective checking module, develop the ARIA data translation module for ChartAlert for ARIA, design and implement an AI-based “smart” check module, and verify the proposed system at the partner sites. Successful completion of these aims will demonstrate the feasibility and commercial potential of the ChartAlert approach. Ultimately, this work will result in an intelligent patient chart checking software, which will increase patient chart check efficiency, save staff time, improve cancer patient treatment safety, and preventing potential lawsuits. Project Narrative Treatment errors in radiation oncology occur at a rate of 2% per patient, and radiation therapy lawsuits rank in the top third of all medical specialties with regard to claims made, claims paid, and damages. Current methods of detecting treatment errors are manual and inefficient. There is a critical need for efficient treatment error detection in order to improve patient safety and save cost. We propose to develop a scalable and comprehensive software system (ChartAlert) for automated patient chart error detection in radiation therapy. ChartAlert can be extended to other types of patient charts to check treatment and prescription consistency and improve patient safety.",An Automated Patient Chart Error Detection System for Radiation Therapy,10015207,R42CA195819,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Innovation Corps', 'Insurance', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Records', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Framework', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'data streams', 'data structure', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'maltreatment', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'research clinical testing', 'software development', 'software systems', 'structured data', 'success', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'treatment site', 'tumor']",NCI,"INFONDRIAN, LLC",R42,2020,855016,0.08756218303603021
"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",9936447,R01EB028591,"['Affect', 'Alkalies', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calcium Oxalate', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Subjects', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ureteroscopy', 'Uric Acid', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcium phosphate', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'prevent', 'risk minimization', 'statistical learning', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,357486,0.060517184859152515
"Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is widely used to detect and evaluate coronary artery disease. The goal of this project is to reduce the radiation dose and/or scan time of SPECT MPI by a combined factor of 16x, while maintaining or increasing diagnostic accuracy. This would enable SPECT MPI to be performed, e.g., with 4x reduced radiation dose and 4x shorter scan time (~2.5 minutes) than typical protocols. Radiation dose in SPECT MPI has been recognized as an important issue, accounting for ~25% of all radiation exposure to patients in medical imaging. Dose reduction particularly addresses the increased prevalence of obese patients (who receive higher dose) and younger cardiac patients (whose radiation risk is higher due to longer life expectancy). Reduction in scan time would improve comfort for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating body-motion image artifacts and reducing healthcare costs by increasing clinical throughput. We will reduce dose and scan time through innovative image reconstruction methods that involve little or no cost and require no additional patient setup steps. We will employ new respiratory and cardiac motion compensation to reduce image artifacts, as well as new deep learning techniques, which will be used for both respiratory-signal estimation and high-performance denoising. We will methodically optimize these techniques and then validate our algorithms in multicenter clinical reader studies. SA1: Develop clinically practical respiratory motion surrogates for low-count studies. T1: Perfect data- driven respiratory surrogate estimation; T2: Optimize data-driven surrogate estimation at reduced counts; T3: Develop and clinically validate depth-sensing cameras for respiratory and body-motion surrogate estimation; T4: Generalization of data-driven surrogate estimation to SPECT systems not having a CT. SA2: Develop deep-learning reconstruction methods and optimize for diagnostic accuracy and dose/scan time. T1: Post-reconstruction DL denoising algorithms for 3D perfusion images for reduced-count and standard- count studies; T2: DL denoising algorithms for 4D cardiac-gated studies; T3: 4D reconstruction with embedded DL denoising, cardiac motion estimation and correction; and T4: DL reconstruction methods with both RMC and CMC, with projection data binned using respiratory surrogate signals derived in SA1. SA3: Perform multicenter clinical reader studies (6 clinicians, 3 institutions) to validate the new algorithms and compare to current clinically-available methods based on diagnostic performance and repeatability in assessing both perfusion and wall motion defects. T1: In comparison to baseline clinical reconstruction, evaluate added benefit of: a) including attenuation and scatter correction, and b) additionally including RMC; T2: Validate DL for improvement of perfusion and function (wall motion) task performance at full-count levels; and T3: Validate DL for improvement of task performance at reduced counts. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will employ new methods of image reconstruction and processing to reduce radiation dose and scan time in cardiac SPECT imaging, which is used 15-20 million times per year to evaluate coronary artery disease. Dose reduction is important because cardiac SPECT accounts for ~25% of all radiation exposure to the public due to medical imaging; reducing scan time would make SPECT more comfortable for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating image artifacts, as well as and reducing healthcare costs by allowing more patients to be scanned per day. Our goal will be to achieve a combined 16x reduction in dose and scan time while maintaining or improving diagnostic accuracy, thereby permitting a 4x reduction in dose while reducing scan time from ~10 minutes to ~2.5 minutes.","Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning",10072432,R01HL154687,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Exposure to', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institution', 'Left Ventricular Function', 'Life Expectancy', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'heart motion', 'hemodynamics', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'prognostic', 'quantum', 'radiation risk', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,786840,0.06374309830613478
"Machine learning accelerated on-line adaptive replanning Abstract. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop and test a novel machine learning (ML) accelerated On-Line Adaptive Replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided radiation therapy (RT) (MRgRT). During the multi-fraction RT process, the location, shape and size of tumors and normal organs vary significantly between the fractions. These interfraction variations are among the major factors that can limit the accuracy of RT targeting. The current standard practice of image-guided RT (IGRT), developed to address the interfraction variations based on cone-beam CT (CBCT), can only correct for translational errors, and thus does not fully account for interfraction changes. To address this issue, researchers recently introduced online adaptive replanning (OLAR) that generates a new plan based on the anatomy of the day and delivers the plan for the fraction. Currently, two main obstacles affect the success of OLAR: (1) the anatomy of the day cannot be delineated accurately based on CBCT, and (2) the time required to perform OLAR is long enough to render it impractical. One way to improve the delineation accuracy is to use MRI versus CT. MRI-guided OLAR is currently being introduced into the clinics to substantially improve RT targeting. However, the bottleneck is still the impractical length of time required to segment the anatomy of the day, which can exceed 30 minutes. Furthermore, available synthetic CT (sCT) generation methods are slow or inaccurate for MRI-guided OLAR. There is no method available to quickly and objective determine when OLAR is necessary. To address these issues, we plan to develop novel techniques in the MOLAR solution. We hypothesize that the MRI-based MOLAR solution will fully account for interfraction changes, thereby substantially improving tumor targeting during RT delivery and the effectiveness of RT. Specifically, we aim to (1) develop practical ML-based solutions to quickly determine the necessity of OLAR and to rapidly generate accurate synthetic CTs; (2) develop ML-based techniques to substantially accelerate segmentation for OLAR using a progressive three-step process; and (3) verify clinical practicality and effectiveness of MOLAR by retrospectively and prospectively applying the MOLAR on MRI sets to test its speed and effectiveness in accounting for interfraction variations. We will develop this novel MOLAR solution by forging unique collaborations between clinical physicists, radiation oncologists and industry developers via an established academic-industry partnership. The successful completion of this project will enable clinicians to routinely practice “image-plan-treat”, which is the optimal solution for MRgRT. This new paradigm will fully account for interfraction variations, improve tumor targeting, reduce normal tissue toxicity, and ultimately encourage clinicians to revise the current doses and/or dose fractionations to increase therapeutic gain, enhance patient quality of life, and/or substantially save on healthcare costs. Our proposed strategy represents a drastic departure from current practice. We firmly believe that this strategy is the future of RT delivery. Project Narrative: This R01 application proposes to develop and test a novel machine learning accelerated online adaptive replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided adaptive radiation therapy through a unique academic and industry partnership.

"Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics The complex environment of modern radiation therapy (RT) comprises data from a rich combination of patient- specific information including: demographics, physical characteristics of high-energy dose, features subsequent to repeated application of image-guidance (radiomics), and biological markers (genomics, proteomics, etc.), generated before and/or over a treatment period that can span few days to several weeks. Rapid growth of these available and untapped “pan-Omics” data, invites ample opportunities for Big data analytics to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine in RT. This particularly true in promising but high-risk RT procedures such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), which have witnessed tremendous expansion due to clinical successes in early disease stages and socio-economic benefits of shortened high dose treatments. This has led to the desire to exploit these treatments into more advanced stages of cancer, however, the unknown risks associated with increased toxicities hamper its potential. Therefore, robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) capable of exploring the complex pan-Omics interaction landscape with the goal of exploiting known principles of treatment response before and during the course of fractionated RT are urgently needed. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome barriers related to prediction uncertainties and human-computer interactions, which are currently limiting the ability to make personalized clinical decisions for real-time response-based adaptation in radiotherapy from available data. To meet this need and overcome current challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team including: clinicians, medical physicists, data scientists, and human factor experts. Specifically, we will develop and quantitively evaluate: (1) graph-based supervised machine learning algorithms for robust prediction outcomes before and during RT; (2) deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize treatment adaptation; and (3) a user-centered software prototype for RT decision support, with the broader goal of building a comprehensive real-time framework for outcome modeling and response-based adaption in RT. We hypothesize that the use of advanced machine learning techniques and user-centered tools will unlock the potentials to move from current population-based approaches limited by subjective experiences and heuristic rules into robust, patient-specific, user-friendly CDSSs. This approach and its corresponding software tool will be tested within two clinical RT sites of lung and liver cancers, to demonstrate its versatility and highlight pertinent human-computer factors and cancer specific issues. Impact statement: Patient-specific big data are now available before and/or during RT courses, offering new and untapped opportunities for personalized treatment. This study will overcome current shortcomings of population-based approaches and data underuse in current RT practice by investigating and developing an intelligent, computer-aided, user-centered, personalized CDSS and test its performance in rewarding but high- risk RT scenarios. The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens. With the wide variety of treatment prescription options in radiation therapy, physicians and patients need to weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment; these treatments are delivered over multiple treatment sessions where additional patient-specific data become available. Clinical decision support can play a pivotal role in deliberations related to response-based adaptation of treatment.

"Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment Abstract Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with preferential delivery of 90Y microspheres to target lesions has shown promising response rates with limited toxicity in the treatment of hepatocellular (HCC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the world. However, to achieve more durable responses, there is much room to improve/adapt the treatment to ensure that all lesions and lesion sub-regions receive adequate radiation delivery. While externally delivered stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is well suited for smaller solitary HCC, its application for larger or multifocal disease is challenged by the radiation tolerance of the normal liver parenchyma. A dosimetry guided combined approach that exploits complementary advantages of internal and external radiation delivery can be expected to improve treatment of HCC. To make this transition, however, prospective clinical trials establishing safety are needed. Furthermore, for routine clinic use, accurate and fast voxel-level dose estimation in internal radionuclide therapy, that lags behind external beam therapy dosimetry, is still needed. Our long-term goal is to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy with personalized dosimetry guided treatment. Our objective in this application is to demonstrate that it is possible to use 90Y imaging based absorbed dose estimates after SIRT to safely deliver external radiation to target regions (voxels) that are predicted to be underdosed and to develop deep learning based tools to make voxel-level internal dose estimation practical for routine clinic use. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will perform a Phase 1 clinical trial in HCC patients where we will take the novel approach of using the 90Y PET/CT derived absorbed dose map after SIRT to deliver SBRT to tumor regions predicted to be underdosed based on previously established dose-response models. The primary objective of the trial is to obtain estimates of safety of combined SIRT+SBRT for future Phase II trial design. In parallel, in Aim 2, building on promising initial results we will develop novel deep learning based tools for 90Y PET/CT and SPECT/CT reconstruction, joint reconstruction-segmentation and scatter estimation under the low count-rate setting, typical for 90Y. These methods have a physics/mathematics foundation, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are included within the iterative reconstruction process, instead of post-reconstruction denoising. In Aim 3, we will develop a CNN for fast voxel-level dosimetry and combine with the CNNs of Aim 2 to develop an innovative end-to-end framework with unified dosimetry-task based training. At the end of this study, we will be ready to use the new deep learning tools in a Phase II trial to demonstrate enhanced efficacy with SIRT+SBRT compared with SIRT alone and advance towards our long- term goal. This will accelerate adoption of these next-generation tools in clinical practice and will have a significant positive impact because treatment based on patient specific dosimetry will substantially improve efficacy, compared with current standard practice in SIRT. Although we focus on 90Y SIRT, our tools will be applicable in radionuclide therapy in general, a rapidly advancing treatment option. Narrative We will perform a Phase I clinical trial where standard-of-care Y-90 microsphere radioembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma will be followed by external radiation to target regions that are predicted to be underdosed by Y-90, based on patient specific dosimetry. In parallel, we will develop and test voxel-level internal dosimetry tools using convolution neural networks to make such dosimetry-based planning accurate and fast for routine clinic use. This study is relevant to public health because a dosimetry-guided combination radiation treatment approach is likely to substantially improve patient outcome compared to current standard practice of internal or external radiation only.",Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment,10052989,R01EB022075,"['90Y', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Evaluable Disease', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver parenchyma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radioembolization', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'dosimetry', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'internal radiation', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'phase II trial', 'prospective', 'radiation delivery', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,670584,0.09631185110748736
"An interactive deep-learning method to semi-automatically segment abdominal organs to support stereotactic MR guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) for abdominal cancers Abstract  Stereotactic MRI-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) is an effective treatment for the pancreas and other upper abdominal cancers. SMART allows precise delivery of escalated prescription dose to the abdominal tumor targets while avoiding the complications of radiation toxicity to the mobile gastrointestinal (GI) organs surrounding the tumor target. In the clinical workflow of SMART, manual segmentation of the GI orangs at risk (OARs) is one of the most important but also the most labor-intensive steps. Manual segmentation takes 10 minutes on average but ranges from 5 to 22 minutes. The slow and costly manual segmentation step directly decreases the accessibility and affordability of online SMART and indirectly reduces the effectiveness of SMART due to intra-fractional body and organ movement of the patients. In this study, we will develop a deep-learning based interactive and semi-automatic procedure to accurately and quickly segment the GI OARs to make SMART more efficient and affordable. Stereotactic MRI-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) has been demonstrated as an effective treatment for the pancreas and other upper abdominal cancers. For nonresectable pancreatic cancer, SMART increased the overall survival at 36 months from 18% to 55% compared to conventional radiation therapy (RT) treatment. In this study, we will develop a deep-learning based interactive and semi-automatic method to accurately and quickly segment the organs-at- risk (OAR) in the abdomen to support SMART. The method to be developed will significantly expedite the OAR segmentation step and make SMART more efficient and affordable.",An interactive deep-learning method to semi-automatically segment abdominal organs to support stereotactic MR guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) for abdominal cancers,10017990,R03EB028427,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Clinical', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dose', 'Dose-Rate', 'Duodenum', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Kidney', 'Large Intestine', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of abdomen', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Toxicity', 'Radiation therapy', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Small Intestines', 'Stomach', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'gastrointestinal', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'irradiation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preservation', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'tumor']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,74942,0.032651609961208944
"Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. An estimated 3.8 million men and 3.4 million women die each year from CHD. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive imaging modality used for diagnosing CHD and for planning therapeutic interventions. Cardiac CT exams are still challenging to perform due to the beating heart and the need to carefully time the scan based on cardiac phase and based on when the peak iodine contrast enhancement is reached. The overall exam duration and the complexity of performing these exams (contrasted with limited reimbursement levels) have limited patient access to cardiac CT to academic hospitals and specialized cardiac imaging centers. As compared to other CT exams, cardiac CT exams require additional patient preparation time, additional CT scans to track the bolus, and additional contrast agent to avoid missing the peak enhancement.  The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. Initial results show that it is possible to extract cardiac gating information from a few CT projection measurements prior to the diagnostic CT scan, without reconstruction. This is made possible by an innovative combination of fast X-ray tube pulsing and deep learning raw data analysis. This project builds on GE Research's experience with cardiac CT technologies, deep learning algorithms and X-ray tube physics, as well as the strong clinical cardiac CT expertise at the University of California San Diego.  The outcome of this project will be a clinical feasibility study of the autonomous triggering approach, which has the potential to simplify and increase patient access to cardiac CT, while reducing exam time, reducing con- trast agent volume, and ensuring robust image quality. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus.

"Automated Treatment Planning for High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy for Cervical Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Cervical cancer affects approximately 7.4/100,000 women in the US with minority women being disproportionally affected. High dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy is an effective treatment modality by irradiating the tumor from inside while simultaneously sparing dose to nearby organs. Multiple randomized trials revealed that including HDR brachytherapy in cervical cancer radiotherapy increases overall survival rates from 46.2% to 58.2%. Yet HDR brachytherapy has seen a downward trend in its use, with complex treatment planning process being one of the major reasons, causing a 13% reduction in cause-specific survival rate. For HDR brachytherapy, the planning has to be accomplished in a very short period of time to reduce patient discomfort and patient motion during the planning process, which could causes substantial deviation of planning geometry from delivery geometry (1.5mm motion leads to >10% change in dose). At present, it takes on average 135 min to manually generate a treatment plan. Due to the time pressure, suboptimal plans are often generated. D2cc, the dosimetric quantity correlated to organ toxicity could be further reduced up to 8.4%, corresponding to 5.1% reduction of complication rate. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop a fully automated treatment planning process to reduce planning time, improve plan quality and therefore outcome, reduce patient discomfort, and most significantly, to promote the use of HDR brachytherapy. Our group has successfully developed and clinically implemented the AutoBrachy system, an automatic planning tool that generates a patient-generic plan in 3 minutes. However, automatic organ segmentation and physician-oriented treatment planning are missing, preventing a fully automated process to generate the patient-specific optimal plan. Current practice relies on human expertise to solve the two problems, taking up to 90 min for segmentation and 30 min for planner and physician to finalize plan. Given the recent advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in mimicking humans to achieve human-level performance, we believe that AI can be used to empower AutoBrachy to achieve a fully automated planning process. The overall goal of this fellowship project is to develop AI-based organ segmentation and human-like treatment planning modules in AutoBrachy, and to validate the system in real patient cases. We will pursue two specific aims (SAs): SA1: System development. Create an automatic organ segmentation module and a human-like automatic planning module. SA2: System validation. Perform a retrospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of the developments. The innovation is the use of state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve critical problems in HDR brachytherapy. This project is logically built on the candidate’s engineering background and medical physics training. It targets at a disease that is highly significant to the underserved population, for which the candidate is highly motivated to solve. The project also fits perfectly with the candidate's long-term career goal of establishing a high-quality independent research program to develop state-of-the-art treatment methods for cancer radiotherapy. NARRATIVE This project will develop and validate artificial intelligence based computational modules for automatic organ segmentation and human-like treatment planning to achieve a fully automated and streamlined treatment planning process for high-dose-rate brachytherapy treatment of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is a severe disease, particularly affecting underserved population who typically present at advanced stages. The developed tools will lead to clinical benefits to patients by improving plan quality, planning efficiency, and patient comfort, as well as will reduce the technical burden of high-dose-rate brachytherapy and therefore promote the use of this effective therapeutic modality to yield broad impacts.",Automated Treatment Planning for High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy for Cervical Cancer,9991582,F31CA243504,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bladder', 'Brachytherapy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Fellowship', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy', 'Human', 'Institution', 'International', 'Irradiated tumor', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rectum', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sigmoid colon', 'Small Intestines', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Underserved Population', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'experience', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'trend', 'tumor']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2020,34644,0.0940901837778304
"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice. There is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour organs at risk in medical images at a high degree of automation for impacting current practice of radiation therapy planning. Encouraged by strong competitive results from the Phase I part of this project, in this grant, further technical advances and a cloud-based software service are proposed. A multicenter clinical evaluation of the new product is also planned to assess the clinical efficacy of the system.",Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning,10241562,R42CA199735,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Blinded', 'Body Regions', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Object Attachment', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Service delivery model', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'software as a service', 'software development', 'software systems', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'virtual']",NCI,"QUANTITATIVE RADIOLOGY SOLUTIONS, LLC",R42,2020,2500,0.05455796068735862
"Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction Nuclear medicine imaging in children has been shown to have significant clinical value across all organ systems. In providing this significant benefit it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that of adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. The governing principle of this project will be to minimize radiation dose while methodically ensuring that lesion detection performance is fully preserved. This will be accomplished by using validations based on both numerical and physician observers measuring performance in tasks that emulate those performed clinically. We will employ two approaches in tandem to enable lowering dose while maintaining performance. First, we will use advanced image reconstruction and processing techniques. Corrections for various forms of image quality degradation will be incorporated in the reconstruction, and deep learning (DL) will be used for post-reconstruction denoising. Second, we will develop methods to correct for both body and respiratory motion, which degrade diagnostic accuracy. Correcting for body and respiratory motion will allow dose to be reduced without loss of image quality and will also offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to minimize motion when imaging children. For this investigation we have selected 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal imaging as a testbed to demonstrate our approaches. Damage to the renal cortex resulting from infection of the kidneys is a critical issue in children, including newborns and toddlers. DMSA SPECT is the “gold-standard” in the evaluation of pyelonephritis and renal scarring post- infection. The concepts we will demonstrate for reduction of radiation dose and correction of motion with DMSA will be translatable to other SPECT (and PET) studies in pediatric imaging and beyond.  Our Specific Aims are: 1. Establish infrastructure for investigating and evaluating advanced reconstruction and motion correction; 2. Determine the extent of radiation dose reduction to pediatric patients through improved reconstruction and DL denoising while maintaining optimal full-dose lesion detection accuracy; 3. Develop data-driven and depth-sensing camera methods for body and respiratory motion estimation and correction; and 4. Conduct numerical and physician observer studies to validate the level of dose reduction enabled by DL denoising and motion correction. Narrative  In nuclear medicine imaging, it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that in adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. Correcting for body and respiratory motion occurring during imaging will improve the quality of the formed three-dimensional images of the patient by reducing blurring and image artifacts and offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to reduce motion when imaging children, which can bear health risks of its own. We propose an advanced reconstruction methodology which would enable reduction in the amount of activity administered and compensate for patient motion during imaging.",Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction,9914572,R01EB029315,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'DMSA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Freedom', 'Gaussian model', 'General Anesthesia', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Newborn Infant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Pyelonephritis', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Study', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toddler', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney infection', 'molecular imaging', 'pediatric patients', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'renal scarring', 'respiratory', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,773763,0.007722299858914813
"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure. We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident",9870417,U01AI148309,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood specimen', 'Bone Marrow', 'Burn injury', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cellular Structures', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Industrial Accidents', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Accidents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Accidents', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Saliva', 'Screening procedure', 'Seeds', 'Surface Antigens', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'White Blood Cell Count procedure', 'base', 'biodosimetry', 'biomarker panel', 'biomarker performance', 'biomarker validation', 'blood damage', 'data exploration', 'design', 'dirty bomb', 'dosimetry', 'humanized mouse', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'irradiation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'medical countermeasure', 'micronucleus', 'nonhuman primate', 'nonlinear regression', 'performance tests', 'peripheral blood', 'point of care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sex', 'stem', 'stem cells']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2020,485237,0.07969462378540038
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,10019348,U24EB028936,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2020,314388,0.13142864527300357
"Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion Project Summary/Abstract X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been increasingly used in medical diagnosis, currently reaching more than 100 million CT scans every year in the US. The increasing use of CT has sparked concern over the effects of radiation dose on patients. It is estimated that every 2000 CT scans will cause one future cancer, i.e., 50,000 cases of future cancers from 100 million CT scans every year. CT brain perfusion (CTP) is a widely used imaging technique for the evaluation of hemodynamic changes in stroke and cerebrovascular disorders. However, CTP involves high radiation dose for patients as the CTP scan is repeated on the order of 40 times at the same anatomical location, in order to capture the full passage of the contrast bolus. Several techniques have been applied for radiation dose reduction in CTP scans, including reduction of tube current and tube voltage, as well as the use of noise reduction techniques such as iterative reconstruction (IR). However, the resultant radiation dose of existing CTP scans is still significantly higher than that of a standard head CT scan. The application of IR techniques in CTP is very limited due to the high complexity and computational burden for processing multiple CTP images that impairs clinical workflow. During the Phase 1 STTR project, we introduced a novel low dose CTP imaging method based on the k-space weighted image contrast (KWIC) reconstruction algorithm. We performed thorough evaluation in both a CTP phantom and clinical CTP datasets, and demonstrated that the KWIC algorithm is able to reduce the radiation dose of existing CTP techniques by 75% without affecting the image quality and accuracy of quantification (i.e., Milestone of Phase 1 STTR). However, the original KWIC algorithm requires rapid-switching pulsed X-ray at pre-specified rotation angles – a hardware capability yet to be implemented by commercial CT vendors. In order to address this limitation, we recently introduced a variant of the KWIC algorithm termed k-space weighted image average (KWIA) that preserves high spatial and temporal resolutions as well as image quality of low dose CTP data (~75% dose reduction) to be comparable to those of standard CTP scans. Most importantly, KWIA does not require modification of existing CT hardware and is computationally simple and fast, therefore has a low barrier for market penetration. The purpose of the Phase 2 STTR project is to further optimize and validate the KWIA algorithm for reducing radiation dose of CTP scans by ~75% while preserving the image quality and quantification accuracy in CTP phantom, clinical CTP data and animal studies. We will further develop innovative deep-learning (DL) based algorithms to address potential motion and other artifacts in KWIA, and commercialize the developed algorithms by collaborating with CT vendors. Relevance to Public Health More than 100 million CT scans are performed every year in the US, estimated to cause 50,000 cases of future cancers. This project will develop, evaluate and commercialize novel CT imaging technologies that reduce the radiation dose of existing CT perfusion techniques by ~75% without compromising imaging speed or quality.",Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion,10006737,R44EB024438,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Animals', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Location', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Tube', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'low dose computed tomography', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'radiation effect', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement', 'voltage']",NIBIB,"HURA IMAGING, INC",R44,2020,820709,0.12996246029499633
"Personalized dosimetry for liver cancer radioembolization using fluid dynamics simulation Project Summary/ Abstract Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths with rising incidence in the U.S and worldwide. Yttrium-90 microspheres radioembolization, or Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT), is a treatment in which a catheter inserted in the patient's hepatic artery delivers radioactive 90Y microspheres to the liver. It is increasingly utilized to treat patients with unresectable liver tumors in second or third line, but some of its potential to improve overall survival is still untapped. The major obstacle in making SIRT more efficient is the treatment planning. It consists in selecting the 90Y activity to inject based on the estimated dose to the tumor and organs-at-risk. The problem is that the dose calculation is highly unreliable and does not include important parameters, such as well-known non-uniformities or the injection point. As a result, physicians often choose very conservative dosage to limit toxicity at the expense of the tumor(s) dose, which drastically reduces SIRT efficacy. The objective of this project is to develop accurate patient-specific dosimetry for SIRT planning. We propose a novel method combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the 90Y microsphere 3D distribution and 90Y physics modeling to predict the absorbed dose. The central and novel approach is to carry out the CFD simulations for each patient's hepatic arterial tree to achieve high accuracy and precision, because anatomical features determining the microsphere distribution present wide variations across the patient population and prohibit the use of generic models. This novel CFD-based dosimetry will be the first comprehensive tool to integrate (1) the hepatic arterial tree extracted from the patient's standard-of-care angiogram, (2) CFD simulation in this hepatic arterial tree to predict and optimize the microsphere distribution, (3) calculation of the absorbed dose with 90Y physics modeling. Our long-term goal is developing a tool that can be integrated in clinical workflow to optimize the quantity and injection point of 90Y microspheres during SIRT planning. To this end, we will pursue two specific aims. (1) We will develop the CFD model and dose calculation using a pig model for validation; (2) we will develop a deep learning approach to simultaneously segment the hepatic artery from the standard-of-care patient angiograms and conduct a morphometric study of the obtained hepatic arterial trees to identify the principal parameters affecting the model. If successful, this project will generate a reliable, patient-specific dosimetry for SIRT providing a comprehensive calculation of the absorbed dose in individual lesions as well as in the healthy liver. This will enable high precision treatment planning to better treat the tumors with a “dose-painting” approach and ultimately improve long-term patient outcome. Narrative Liver cancer is one the most prevalent type of cancer with deadly outcome in the U.S. and worldwide. It is increasingly treated with selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) but due to severe limitations in treatment planning and dose calculation in particular, the efficacy of SIRT is drastically reduced. This work addresses this central issue by developing new dosimetry to personalize treatment planning for each patient, with the ultimate goal of improving liver cancer long-term patient outcome.",Personalized dosimetry for liver cancer radioembolization using fluid dynamics simulation,9899967,R21CA237686,"['3-Dimensional', '90Y', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Albumins', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Convolution Kernel', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distal', 'Doppler Ultrasound', 'Dose', 'Family suidae', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatic artery', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radioactive', 'Radioembolization', 'Radioisotopes', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tracer', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Trees', 'Unresectable', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer type', 'clinical implementation', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dosage', 'dosimetry', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'internal radiation', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2020,167109,0.07721555109334438
"FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring Project Abstract/Summary Ultra-low dose CT, defined as sub-millisievert (sub-mSv) imaging of the entire chest, abdomen or pelvis, is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, photon starvation and electronic noise make imaging at such dose levels challenging. Photon starvation refers to the number of transmitted photons. When no photons are transmitted, the measurement is essentially useless. If few photons are transmitted, the measurement carries information, but its interpretation and value are confounded by electronic noise. Solutions with encouraging results have been offered for sub-mSv chest imaging, but these are not widely available and not easily generalizable across anatomical sites, vendors and scanner models. We propose a novel, robust solution for ultra-low dose CT that will overcome these issues. We refer to our solution as FAIR-CT, which stands for Finite-Angle Integrated-Ray CT. FAIR-CT operates under the principle that photon starvation and the confounding effect of electronic noise are best handled by avoiding them, which is made possible by increasing the data integration time during the source-detector rotation. FAIR-CT data strongly deviate from the classical CT data model and share the streak artifact problem of sparse view sampling. FAIR-CT data acquisition also affects azimuthal resolution. We anticipate that these issues can be suitably handled using advanced image reconstruction techniques. Once available, FAIR-CT will allow improvements in longitudinal monitoring of patients with chronic diseases such as COPD, urolithiasis and diabetes, thereby reducing mortality and co-morbidities. FAIR-CT will also allow advancing cancer therapy treatments by enabling adjustments in radiation therapy plans between dose fractions without increasing CT radiation exposure, and by facilitating early detection of inflammations in drug-based therapies. To bring FAIR-CT towards fruition, we will work on two specific aims: (1) Creation of a comprehensive collection of FAIR-CT data sets enabling rigorous development, validation and evaluation of image reconstruction algorithms; (2) Development, validation and evaluation of advanced image reconstruction algorithms. The FAIR-CT data sets will involve the utilization of state-of-the-art scanners and include real patient data synthesized from high dose scans acquired for standard of care. Two complementary image reconstruction approaches will be investigated. Namely, model-based iterative reconstruction with non-linear forward model and dedicated compressed sensing regularization; and deep learning-based refinement of FBP reconstructions using target images with task-adapted image quality. Image quality evaluation will account for critical biological variables and involve objective metrics such as structure similarity and contrast-to-noise ratio for clinically-proven lesions, as well as task-based performance metrics involving human readers. Ultra-low dose X-ray computed tomography is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, physics-related challenges and impractical solutions make this concept unavailable for everyday clinical use. We will develop a novel solution that is practical and can quickly be brought to clinical practice.",FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring,9877188,R21EB029179,"['Abdomen', 'Academia', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Body mass index', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computers', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fruit', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Starvation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'expectation', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'low dose computed tomography', 'mortality', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'targeted imaging', 'urolithiasis']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2020,265345,0.10479162957167626
"Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Cardiac CT provides fast non-invasive assessment of CAD with a high sensitivity and negative predictive value – provided that the lumen can be visualized. However, heavily calcified or stented coronary segments are non- assessable, precluding non-invasive diagnosis of flow-limiting coronary plaques in an estimated 2 million U.S. adults. In addition, the spatial resolution of state-of-the-art CT systems is insufficient for robust visualization of features associated with high risk plaques. Further, while CT can quantitatively evaluate the impact of obstructive CAD on myocardial function using dynamic perfusion imaging, this requires relatively high patient radiation doses, which has limited widespread adoption. Considering the high personal and societal cost of CAD, robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam is critically needed. Built by Siemens Healthcare, a first-of-its-kind, whole-body, photon-counting-detector (PCD) CT system was installed in 2014 at the Mayo Clinic. With support from NIH award EB016966, we showed that the increased iodine contrast-to-noise ratio, decreased electronic noise, spectral imaging capabilities, and improved spatial resolution of PCD-CT relative to commercial CT enabled us to accurately measure increased vasa vasorum density in injured swine carotid arterial walls, demonstrating the exceptional potential of PCD-CT in vascular imaging. Because this system lacks cardiac imaging capabilities, our objective is to develop and validate a PCD dual-source (DS) CT system and novel imaging algorithms to accurately assess CAD in humans, especially in patients with heavily calcified, stented, or high-risk plaques, and to identify patients with myocardial perfusion defects. Our premise is that the established benefits of PCD-CT, used with a DS geometry and advanced noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms, can meet these objectives. Our proposal is significant in many ways: the technology developments will benefit all of CT imaging; robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam will obviate the need for additional imaging, reducing the overall time and cost to comprehensively evaluate CAD and its clinical significance. To extend the demonstrated benefits of PCDs to cardiac CT will require numerous physics, engineering, and algorithm innovations, including novel noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms using energy, spatial and temporal domain redundancies, as well as deep learning. These advances will culminate in a large clinical study to demonstrate not merely that the images are “better,” as is so often done, but that PCD-DSCT provides clinically-significant improvements in the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected CAD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a new type of cardiac computed tomography (CT) scanner that is able to comprehensively assess coronary artery disease in humans. This technology, known as photon-counting- detector dual-source CT, is capable of exceptional spatial and temporal resolution, multi-energy spectral imaging and reduced radiation doses, allowing it to image the coronary artery and myocardium with unparalleled quality. This will enable comprehensive assessment of coronary artery anatomy and myocardial function from a single imaging exam, reducing time to diagnosis and cost, while also improving patient diagnosis and management.",Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management,9972330,R01EB028590,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Defect', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Family suidae', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Iodine', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stents', 'Sudden Death', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'calcification', 'clinically significant', 'coronary plaque', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'photon-counting detector', 'routine practice', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'societal costs', 'spectral energy', 'spectrograph', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'vasa vasorum']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,628053,0.003316819656739692
"STAN-CT: Standardization and Normalization of CT images for Lung Cancer Patients Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and one of the most common cancers among both men and women in the United States. Recent advances in high-resolution imaging set the stage for radiomics to become an active emerging field in cancer research. However, the promise of radiomics is limited by a lack of image standardization tools, because computed tomography (CT) images are often acquired using scanners from different vendors with customized acquisition parameters, posing a fundamental challenge to radiomic studies across sites. To overcome this challenge, especially for large-scale, multi-site radiomic studies, advanced algorithms are required to integrate, standardize, and normalize CT images from multiple sources. We propose to develop STAN-CT, a deep learning software package that can automatically standardize and normalize a large volume of diagnostic images to facilitate cross-site large-scale image feature extraction for lung cancer characterization and stratification. By precisely mitigating the differences in advanced radiomic features of CT images, STAN-CT will overcome research silos and promote medical image resource sharing, ultimately improving the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Our goal will be achieved through two Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a working prototype to standardize CT images. First, we will collect raw image data from lung cancer patients and reconstruct CT images using multiple image reconstruction parameters, and we will scan a multipurpose chest phantom along with five different nodule inserts. Then, we will develop and train STAN-CT for CT image standardization. An alternative training architecture will be developed to achieve the improved model training stability. In Aim 2. We will deploy and test STAN-CT for image standardization locally and across three medical centers. First, we will make the STAN-CT software package available to the public by providing a menu-driven web-interface so that that users can conveniently convert medical images that were taken using non-standard protocols to one or multiple standards that they specify. Second, we will deploy STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky for local performance validation. We will test the functionality, reliability, and performance of STAN-CT using both patient chest CT image data collected at large-scale and the phantom image data, both independent to training. Third, we will deploy and test STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky as well as the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Emory University for cross- center performance validation. We will use the same multipurpose chest phantom and both standard and non- standard protocols to validate STAN-CT at the three centers. We will test the generalizability of STAN-CT using clinical CT images of human patients and will determine whether a model trained using the data from one medical center are applicable for images collected at another place. Finally, we will distribute the software package of STAN-CT for public use. STAN-CT will enable a wide range of radiomic researches to identify diagnostic image features that strongly associated with lung cancer prognosis. Project Narrative Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most popular diagnostic image modalities routinely used for assessing anatomical tissue characteristics for disease management.

"Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry Abstract Photon-counting CT (PCCT) is a major technological advance in CT imaging. Using photon-counting instead of current energy-integrating detectors, PCCT can offer superior performance in terms of spatial resolution, artifact reduction, and most notably, material decomposition. PCCT’s energy differentiation utility offers an ability to more precisely distinguish different materials and optimize and expand the use of contrast agents in CT. With these abilities, PCCT can significantly facilitate quantitative imaging, reduce radiation exposure, and enable revolutionary new applications in functional and physiological imaging beyond existing CT techniques. To realize the full potential of PCCT in clinical practice, the technology needs comprehensive assessments and application-based optimizations. Effective design and deployment of PCCT depends on many design and use choices that should be made in view of the eventual clinical utility. Making these choices requires large scale trials on actual patients. However, such trials are challenging, considering the need to make many decisions prior to prototyping, the limited numbers of prototype PCCT scanners available today, and the often-unknown ground-truth in the patient images. Even for existing prototype systems, many decisions require repetitive trials with multiple acquisitions. This is both unethical and impractical considering radiation safety concerns and costs. These challenges can be overcome by utilizing virtual imaging trials (VITs) using computerized patients and imaging models. VITs provide an efficient means with which to determine the most effective and optimized design and use of imaging technologies with complete control over the study design. In our prior funded project, we developed a VIT framework to evaluate standard energy-integrating detector CT technologies. In this project, we expand the applicability of this framework to photon-counting detector CT. Specifically, we enhance our computational XCAT phantoms to model the necessary higher-resolution detail including normal and abnormal tissue heterogeneities and intra-organ contrast perfusion diversity across populations (Aim 1). To image the phantoms, we develop the first PCCT simulator capable of mimicking existing and emerging prototypes (Aim 2). The enhanced VIT framework will provide the essential foundation with which to comprehensively evaluate and optimize PCCT technologies and applications. In Aim 3, we assess and optimize the use of PCCT for morphological, textural, and compositional quantification in select oncologic and cardiac applications, two leading health detriments in the US where PCCT can offer a notable impact. The results will be the first of their kind in comprehensively evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of PCCT, determining optimum dose per patient size for PCCT imaging of patients for cancerous lesions and cardiac plaque/stenoses, and helping to establish the effective utility of PCCT in clinical care. The purpose of this project is to develop and utilize a virtual framework to comprehensively evaluate and optimize emerging photon-counting devices and applications in CT imaging. The results will be the first of their kind evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of photon-counting CT and will help establish its effectual utility in oncologic and cardiac care.",Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry,10051026,R01EB001838,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Anatomy', 'Cancerous', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Imaging technology', 'Industry', 'Lesion', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Stenosis', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cardiac plaque', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'dosimetry', 'experimental study', 'human imaging', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'photon-counting detector', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual imaging']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,545403,0.061143219111578544
"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning ABSTRACT The accuracy of radiation treatment planning (RTP) heavily influences the effectiveness of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Individualized RTP begins with a “simulation”, in which the patient in a treatment position is commonly scanned using computed tomography (CT) to define the treatment target and organs at risk (OARs). When soft-tissue contrast is inadequate to support accurate target and OAR delineation in CT based RTP, conservatively large treatment margins are used to avoid a geometric miss. The crude treatment prevents delivering sufficient radiation dose to the tumor without exceeding the tolerance of surrounding normal tissues. Magnetic resonance (MR) can be used as a simulation platform complementary to CT for improved soft-tissue conspicuity. Yet, such a complicated, costly and tedious multi-modal RTP workflow along with unavoidable systematic MR-CT co-registration errors has limited its applications in EBRT, especially at the abdominal site whereby anatomies are highly mobile. Over the past few years, there is a keen interest in the integration of MR alone into RTP and even the therapy workflow (i.e. MR-guided radiotherapy, MRgRT). The abdomen poses critical challenges to MR simulation. Current MR imaging sequences are suboptimal to produce motion-free images and resolve respiratory motion. MR data processing for abdominal RTP is underdeveloped. Contouring of OARs typically relies on manual, tedious procedures that are time-consuming and variation-prone. In this proposal, we will substantially improve the MR acquisition and multi-organ auto-segmentation, so the potential of MR as a simulation modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal EBRT. Three specific aims will be completed. In Aim 1, we will develop a standalone multi-task MR (MT-MR) sequence dedicated to abdominal MR simulation. In Aim 2, we will optimize multi-organ auto-segmentation based on MT-MR images. In Aim 3, we will assess the performance of MT-MR in the context of pancreatic cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy planning. Successful completion of the project will dramatically improve treatment precision and clinical outcomes, thus further promoting the adoption of radiotherapy in the management of abdominal cancers. Moreover, the developed techniques will open the door to future studies aiming at optimizations in many aspects of radiotherapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Imaging is essential for precise radiation treatment planning. MR based planning is challenging in the abdomen whereby anatomies are highly mobile.

"Development and Validation of a Collaborative Web/Cloud-Based Dosimetry System for Radiopharmaceutical Therapy. Project Summary  Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) – the use of targeted radionuclides to deliver radiation specifically to cancer cells and their microenvironment – is a fundamentally different approach to cancer therapy that is growing, with a substantial number of large and small pharmaceuticals companies developing products in this area and radionuclide producers making substantial investments in scaling up production. This is especially true in the area of alpha emitters. The dosimetric evaluation of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals is a key requirement for regulatory approval and optimal administration of RPTs, especially in combination with external beam radiation therapy. This project will provide a cloud-based dosimetry software service, delivered through a web-browser, that includes the full complement of methods needed for dosimetry in the context of obtaining regulatory approval of RPTs and, ultimately, for optimal clinical delivery. Providing this in a cloud-based system will enable a variety of models for selling the service that do not require a large up-front capital investment for clinics or radiopharmaceutical developers. It also will provide access to expert advice, customization, and dosimetry services, and allow for collaboration between developers, dosimetry experts, and clinical sites. To accomplish the goal of developing this cloud-based web-browser-delivered RPT dosimetry software service, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Design, develop and implement a web/cloud-based integrated software system for treatment planning of RPT therapy; (2) design and implement a full server-side framework for subscription, authentication, and granting collaborative privileges for the various processes and data in the dosimetry pipeline; (3) optimize and adapt the four most computationally intensive processes for a multi-processor cloud-based compute environment; (4) apply and evaluate the toolchain developed in aims 1-3 to phantom, simulated and existing patient data. Successful completion of this project will produce a cloud-based software system delivered to the user via a web browser that provides an integrated, streamlined, robust, state-of-the-art system for RPT treatment planning. This system would enable a collaborative approach to multi-center clinical trials and eventually to clinical delivery of optimally dosed RPT. Projective Narrative  Radiopharmaceutical therapy is an emerging cancer therapy modality involving the targeted delivery of radiation to tumors using tumor-targeting molecules. The dosimetric evaluation of the therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals is a key requirement for regulatory approval and optimal administration of RPTs. This project seeks to develop a cloud-based software system delivered to the user via a web browser that provides an integrated, streamlined, robust, state-of-the-art system for RPT treatment planning; and enables a collaborative approach to multi-center clinical trials and eventually to the clinical delivery of optimally dosed RPT.",Development and Validation of a Collaborative Web/Cloud-Based Dosimetry System for Radiopharmaceutical Therapy.,10019481,R44CA213782,"['3-Dimensional', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Businesses', 'Capital', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Dose-Rate', 'Environment', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Radiation', 'Radioisotopes', 'Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Services', 'Side', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Translating', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical research site', 'cloud based', 'collaborative approach', 'computing resources', 'cost effective', 'data de-identification', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dosimetry', 'encryption', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'multicore processor', 'neoplastic cell', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiation delivery', 'reconstruction', 'scale up', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'software systems', 'targeted delivery', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'web services']",NCI,"RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL IMAGING AND DOSIMETRY, LLC",R44,2020,162019,0.047397636653931284
