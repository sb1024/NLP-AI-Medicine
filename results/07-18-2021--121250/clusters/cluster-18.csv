"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9791316,R00ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2019,246653,0.017800453913186128
"Deep Learning of Street View Imagery to assess Urban Green Space Relationships with Mental Health:  A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY The built environment is an important modifiable determinant of human health, yet our ability to understand its effects on human health have been limited by the lack of scalable data on specific components (and exposures) of the built environment. The emergence of ubiquitous geo-referenced imagery in the United States (e.g. Google Street View Imagery), combined with recent advances in image processing using deep learning algorithms, offers unprecedented opportunity for measuring street-level built environment features at scales needed for population-based research. To develop and demonstrate the potential of deep learning algorithms for environmental health research we will: develop methods to assess green space features using street view imagery and deep learning algorithms; create new deep learning algorithms to predict urban green space quality, stress reduction and restorative potential; and apply new street view measures to 9,070 adult Twin Pairs in the Washington Twin Registry to determine associations between green space and mental health. Our proposed study will dramatically move the field of environmental health forward by provided a completely new, transferable and scalable exposure assessment method for assessing built environment exposures relevant to human health and provide robust information on how urban green space influences mental health. Overall, our new approach will provide rich new data sources for environmental epidemiologists, city planners, policy makers and neighborhoods and communities at large. PROJECT NARRATIVE The built environment is an important determinant of human health, yet our ability to measure specific components of the built environment relevant to health is limited.

"Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures: Administrative Supplement for U3 Populations Project Summary/Abstract of the PRIME parent award: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are major causes of perinatal mortality and morbidity and have profound consequences for maternal and child health, but it is unclear if and how rates of HDP are changing over time, or whether neighborhood conditions (e.g., racial residential segregation) and air pollution exposure are associated with risk of developing HDP. We use detailed birth records and Bayesian spatial analysis methods to better understand how HDP rates have changed over a 20 year period (1995-2014), whether racial/ethnic disparities in HDP rates have narrowed or widened in this time frame, and if neighborhood racial segregation and air pollution exposure are associated with an individual’s HDP risk.",Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures: Administrative Supplement for U3 Populations,9911827,R01ES028819,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Air Pollution', 'Architecture', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Birth Records', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Geography', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Time', 'Unemployment', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'data resource', 'early childhood', 'health care availability', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'perinatal morbidity', 'pollutant', 'pregnancy disorder', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'segregation', 'social', 'social stress', 'stressor', 'tool', 'web site']",NIEHS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,117375,0.043986194139622355
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric.

Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health.

"Systems Biology of Aging: Data-science meets Gero-science PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The funds requested in this R13 application are for partial support of “Systems Biology of Aging: Data-science meets Gero-science” annual meetings to be offered each August/September from 2019 through 2022 at The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine (JAX-GM) in Farmington, Connecticut. This meeting will bring together up to 150 interdisciplinary scientists including molecular biologists, immunologists, computational biologists, and geriatricians, who share a common interest in understanding aging and aging-associated disease at the systems level. Many aging-associated diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, are influenced by dysfunctions in the immune system. Recent advances in genomic profiling techniques (e.g., single cell transcriptomics) provide an opportunity to uncover aging-related changes in human cells/tissues and to link these changes to health and lifespan. The wealth and complexity of data produced using these technologies is ever increasing, as is the need to develop advanced computational methods to mine and integrate these data. Despite this need, there are currently no formal venues at which scientists, specifically those in the aging field, can be trained in the basics and application of data mining techniques (i.e., machine learning algorithms). Furthermore, current conferences on aging are not aimed at specifically bringing together computational biologists, immunologists and basic and clinical aging researchers. Therefore, the objectives of this meeting are: (1) to recognize and emphasize the highly interdisciplinary nature of the aging field and to promote and accelerate collaborations and cross-pollination of ideas across the three disciplines: aging, immunology, and computational biology; (2) to provide trainees (students and postdoctoral fellows) an opportunity to closely interact with, and gain feedback from, more senior investigators to advance their projects and establish connections to help build their careers; and (3) to provide an opportunity for researchers in the field of aging to learn the basics of machine learning techniques, which they will be able to immediately apply to their own research upon return to their home institutions. We will reach these objectives through carrying out the following Aims. In Aim 1, we will organize an interdisciplinary meeting and hands-on workshop focused on aging and aging-related diseases. The meeting will include a 2-day seminar session featuring talks by leading scientists, followed by a 1-day hands-on workshop on the basics of machine learning. In Aim 2, we will promote interactions to foster collaborative research and career advancement, including through a poster session. In Aim 3, we will recruit diverse attendees. Our proposed speaker list features several female scientists, and we will use our partnership networks to specifically recruit attendees from nationally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. The ultimate goal of the meeting is to advance the aging research field through expediting collaborations and the understanding of aging-related genomic data via application of advanced data mining approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Aging and aging-associated diseases, such as Alzheimer's, cancer and cardiovascular disease, represent a significant and growing health and economic burden, with the elderly population of the US projected to double by 2030. Herein, we propose to organize an interdisciplinary conference with a hands-on computational training component that will bring together scientists from the fields of aging, immunology, and computational biology, which will enable creative collaborations and train early career scientists in the aging research field on the basics of advanced computational techniques to mine aging-related genomic data. This is ultimately expected to lead to a better molecular understanding of the aging process and to novel approaches for the improvement of human healthspan and/or lifespan.",Systems Biology of Aging: Data-science meets Gero-science,9912317,R13AG064968,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Biology of Aging', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Career Mobility', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impaired cognition', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scholarship', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shock', 'Societies', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'cancer type', 'career', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically significant', 'data mining', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'graduate student', 'health economics', 'healthspan', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'posters', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'senescence', 'skills', 'symposium', 'technology development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIA,JACKSON LABORATORY,R13,2019,38566,0.016577959583245896

"Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging PROJECT SUMMARY Progressive aging-related cognitive declines are associated with limitations in self-care and functional independence, deteriorating physical health, and impending dementia and mortality, even among the otherwise healthy. Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie cognitive aging is key to developing interventions to prevent or ameliorate cognitive decline. Disconnection theories of aging specifically implicate weakening of structural brain connectivity as a key mechanism of cognitive decline, but until recently, diffusion MRI data and connectomic methods needed to rigorously test such theories have been lacking. To expedite understanding how aging-related changes in the human structural connectome relate to aging-related cognitive declines, we will apply the latest connectomic and multivariate data analysis methods to existing data from two highly unique datasets: (1) The UK Biobank, a cross-sectional sample of ~10,000 40-75 year old adults, who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information; and (2) The Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936, a narrow-age cohort of older adults (baseline age = 73 years; N = 731) who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information on each of three separate occasions, each separated by three years. Using recently developed graph-theoretic models, we will construct structural brain connectome networks for each participant's diffusion MRI data at each wave and extract indices reflective of network topology within several specific networks of interest (NOIs) identified ex ante. We will also identify topologically central hub regions that disproportionately govern efficiency within each individual's connectome network. We will apply cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models to examine aging-related transformations in network indices, examine concurrent and longitudinal coupling between network indices and cognitive abilities, and test predictors of levels and changes in network indices and cognitive abilities. This will allow us to contrast the predictive utility of the selected NOIs for cognitive aging and to identify specific features of network architecture involved in cognitive aging and mediate the effects of demographic, medical, and lifestyle risk factors for cognitive aging. We additionally implement machine- learning methods to estimate an upper bound of prediction of cognitive aging from network indices, and identify novel features of network topology as candidate mechanisms of cognitive decline. The availability of two uniquely large and well-characterized datasets will allow us to ensure that findings are rigorous and reproducible using within sample (holdout) and between sample cross-validation. For all aims, we will place considerable emphasis on testing for incremental validity of network indices relative to both conventional structural neuroanatomical measures and topologically naïve summary indices of network integrity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie aging-related cognitive declines is key to developing interventions to improve both health and quality of life. This project will examine how changes in the structural connections between brain regions relate to changes in cognitive abilities over time and test hypothesized health, sociodemographic, and genetic predictors of such changes.",Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging,9691831,R01AG054628,"['3 year old', '3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Genetic', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Self Care', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'aged', 'biobank', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'functional independence', 'genetic predictors', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'social', 'sociodemographics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2019,470535,0.024992028332895117
"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,9703882,R01AI135115,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladeshi', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholera', 'Cholera Vaccine', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Haiti', 'Haitian', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Household', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sanitation', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Standardization', 'Surveillance Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Vibrio cholerae O1', 'Vibrio cholerae infection', 'Water', 'age related', 'base', 'cohort', 'diarrheal disease', 'disorder risk', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,687902,0.027722847690841174
"AI-enabled fully automated retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders Abstract  In this SBIR project, we present EyeQuant, an AI-enabled fully automated tool to com- pute retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenera- tive disorders. The large, growing, and aging population is likely to lead to a dramatic increase in the number of people at risk for dementia and other cognitive disorders, with more than 130 million people expected to be affected by 2050. Vascular disease is an important cause of dementia and cognitive decline in older people. The retinal microvas- culature, which can be non-invasively captured on color fundus photographs, share em- bryological origins, anatomical features, and physiological properties with the cerebral microvasculature. Biomarkers capturing structural changes in retinal microvasculature have been shown to be indicative of cognitive disorders in patients, including mild cogni- tive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. These structural vas- culature changes can manifest themselves earlier than any functional changes commonly associated with these cognitive disorders. A tool, such as EyeQuant, that can automati- cally and easily characterize these structural changes as biomarkers directly in primary care settings using fundus photographs, would enable early detection and effective man- agement of patients with cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders. Narrative EyeQuant is an AI-enabled fully automated tool to compute retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders. With more than 130 million people expected to be effected by dementia and other cognitive disorders by 2050, the burden and global annual costs of 818 billion USD is expected to increase significantly over the coming decades.

"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. The proposed program will apply a novel dental biomarker of exposure to multiple chemicals and cutting-edge statistical methods to identify specific life stages including perinatal periods that correspond to increased susceptibility to neurodevelopmental effects of metal toxicant mixtures.",Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture,9767585,R01ES026033,"['8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Arsenic', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cadmium', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Nutrient', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deciduous tooth', 'developmental neurotoxicity', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'perinatal period', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,608605,0.05230906149547909
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia,9614566,R01DC013063,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cathodes', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Love', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug discovery', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'forgetting', 'frontal lobe', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'gaze', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sound', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'supervised learning', 'treatment services', 'voltage']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2019,438611,-0.05530442375609099
"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development,9681837,F31ES030263,"['Address', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Flame Retardants', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenols', 'Placenta', 'Plastics', 'Policy Maker', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'consumer product', 'data management', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fundamental research', 'health of the mother', 'high dimensionality', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'modifiable risk', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'pollutant', 'polybrominated diphenyl ether', 'prenatal exposure', 'public health intervention', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2019,31591,0.07144809769537891
"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9749156,R01ES027747,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cadmium', 'Carbon', 'Carbon Black', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Membrane', 'Mercury', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Nitrates', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'RNA marker', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Trace Elements', 'Translations', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vesicle', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'ambient air pollution', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'extracellular vesicles', 'follow-up', 'inflammatory marker', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'modifiable risk', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'toxic metal']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2019,708647,0.01493177327539365
"Spatiotemporal Risk Assessment Modeling of Chemical Mixtures Project Summary: Comprehensive exposure assessments that account for mixtures of environmental chemical pollutants are vital to understand true relationships between human exposures and disease outcomes. Moreover, human or daily mobility of people is often misrepresented by exposure models resulting in exposure misclassification. This proposal aims to determine how air pollution chemical mixtures and human mobility impact environmental and human health risk assessments, which aligns with the NIEHS core mission “to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives.” The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. The primary mentor, Dr. Kim Anderson, a professor at Oregon State University is an expert in passive exposure assessment methods and analytical quantification of chemical mixtures in environmental media, which provides an excellent environment to transition the candidate from a background in single-pollutant exposure assessment to multi-pollutant mixture exposure and risk assessment. Along with new teaching opportunities, the candidate will receive training from Dr. Anderson in research methods such as primary data collection, biochemical monitoring for epidemiological studies, and toxicology approaches in risk assessment. Collaborators Drs. Katrina Waters and Justin Teeguarden, senior scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, will provide career development advising and research training in areas such as data integration for epidemiology and toxicology studies and hands-on experience with large-scale computational resources. This proposal’s aims will address the following central hypotheses: (1) Accounting for chemical mixtures in exposure will produce synergistic health effects not observed by chemicals individually, and (2) Personal sampling and model-based exposure assessment accounting for human mobility will produce varying risk estimates depending on the pollutant and individuals’ mobility. During the K99 phase, aim 1 will collect multi-chemical air quality data for a daily time resolved stationary monitoring campaign resulting in a space and time resolved multi-pollutant (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds) air quality dataset. Aim 2 will develop spatiotemporal exposure models for gas-phase mixtures using land use regression, geostatistical, and machine learning models. In the R00 phase, aim 3 will perform a risk assessment for chemical mixtures and acute lung health effects accounting for human mobility using a case-crossover design and comparing three exposure assessment methods: traditional spatiotemporal models, spatiotemporal models accounting for human mobility, and personal exposure monitors. Together, this proposal addresses the major limitations in environmental exposure assessment, pollutant mixtures and human mobility, and is within the mixtures and air pollution focus areas of environmental exposure research at NIEHS. Project Narrative The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. This study will validate spatiotemporal statistical approaches in chemical mixture exposure modelling, evaluate the cumulative effects of chemical mixtures in air pollution and acute lung health effects, and determine the extent of exposure misclassification due to human mobility.

"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices1-4. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children5-7. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes8-10. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides11. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures12,13, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized14,15. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid16. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California17-20, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind21,22, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics23 to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,9764378,K99ES028743,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K99,2019,81281,0.03449382434653361
"Developing an integrated virtual assistant (IVA): A tailored behavior tracking and reminder solution to assist persons with dementia and their caregivers Project Summary/Abstract Recent attempts to estimate early stage prevalence of early stage dementia in the United States suggest that as much as 19% of the population over the age of 65 may be living with early stage disease. In early stage, function loss, particularly in the memory domain, significantly impacts instrumental activities of living (IADL) such as responsibility for own medications and scheduling. Solutions are needed that can adapt to the person with dementia and their caregiver through disease progression, tailor the level of support offered based on the changing needs of the dyad, and facilitate more time spent safely aging in place. In this project, an integrated virtual assistant (IVA) will serve as the interface between persons with dementia (PWD), their caregivers, and a suite of smart home technologies to provide aging-in-place support. Our long-term goal is to develop and commercialize IVA, a behavior tracking and reminder solution that will integrate smart home sensors, voice activation, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into an easy-to-use application that provides tailored assistance to PWD and their caregivers as a dyad. The broader impact of these technologies is more time spent safely aging in place, better informed caregivers, and a reduction in caregiver burden and strain.

"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychopathology arising from a disruption of emotional function affects over 400 million people globally, yet we lack a neurobiological model to guide classification and treatment.

"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,9685220,K01HL141637,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perceived quality of life', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Professional Organizations', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health data', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'patient expectation', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'skills', 'survivorship', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'working group']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,166704,0.00809193266084417
"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes.

"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention,9798942,R01AG063887,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrophic', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'black/white disparity', 'brain health', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcification', 'critical period', 'dementia risk', 'early life exposure', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fasting glucose', 'heart function', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'treatment strategy', 'trend', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2019,829290,0.0039763170691683464
"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework,9884859,R00ES027511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'African American', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Future', 'GALA', 'Genetic', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Puerto Rican', 'Randomized', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'analog', 'base', 'career', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'exposure pathway', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'minority children', 'pollutant', 'public health intervention', 'pulmonary function', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social disparities', 'social vulnerability', 'tool']",NIEHS,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,249000,-0.0200289904069434
"A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research Summary/Abstract This project will construct a Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (IPUMS-MLP) of unprecedented scale and scope. Using cutting-edge automatic record linkage technology and drawing on complete count U.S. census data available from IPUMS for the period 1850 to 1940, the project will construct millions of individual life histories and trace millions of families over multiple generations. This infrastructure will provide the most comprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will transform our understanding of processes of population aging. The work will require significant innovation and new technical infrastructure to accommodate the massive scale of the database. These data will allow investigators to directly observe changes in aging processes and life-course transitions during the period in which U.S. society was being transformed by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, demographic transition, and economic collapse. Investigators will be able to follow individuals over time to evaluate the impact of early-life conditions on later outcomes, trace life-course transitions into adulthood and old age, and observe family change over multiple generations. IPUMS-MLP will enrich existing aging surveys by providing data on multiple generations of forebears of survey respondents; likewise, it will enrich existing historical databases by enabling them to connect with descendants across multiple generations. Leveraging billions of dollars of federal investments in census data and transactional records from a variety of administrative sources, this project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. Project Narrative The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in health and well-being of the older population and will support research on the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. For example, the data will enable examinations of the impact of lead exposure to late onset Alzheimer’s disease, the socioeconomic and health effects of early-life income support, intergenerational transmission of health and wellbeing over multiple generations, and the impact of early-life cognitive capacity on later-life health and economic outcomes.",A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research,9769604,R01AG057679,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Big Data', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Demographic Transitions', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Genealogy', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immigration', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Mission', 'Names', 'Neighborhoods', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Process', 'Process', 'Public Policy', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Social Processes', 'Social Security', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Urbanization', 'War', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive capacity', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'economic outcome', 'experience', 'health economics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'life history', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,681232,0.0226389177247147
"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,9750581,R01AG059729,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caucasians', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Diet', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Freedom', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature aging syndrome', 'Preparation', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'ST14 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'biracial', 'caucasian American', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'disability', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fitness', 'healthy aging', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'male', 'mental state', 'microbial', 'middle age', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sarcopenia', 'walking speed', 'young adult']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,559078,-0.02034090068024027
"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development award will: a) Lead to the development and validation of a pediatric-specific Environmental Enteropathy (EE) Deep Learning Net for small intestinal structure which is urgently needed to standardize the diagnosis, care, and research of EE worldwide; b) Employ computational methods to correlate Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing morphological EE features with multiomic data to provide comprehensive diagnostic and predictive criteria for EE, and c) Validation of promising circulating biomarkers against intestinal biopsies, the diagnostic gold standard for enteropathies. Successful completion of this work will channel our improved understanding of the gut's critical role in childhood stunting pathways towards effective interventions to improve nutrition and health in at risk populations.",Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy,9666310,K23DK117061,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Asia', 'Bangladeshi', 'Bile Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Celiac Disease', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Duodenum', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gluten', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human Pathology', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lactulose', 'Lamina Propria', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lymphocytosis', 'MS4A1 gene', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Multiomic Data', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Virginia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'enteric pathogen', 'imaging approach', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'intraepithelial', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrition', 'oral vaccine', 'patient oriented', 'socioeconomics', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,K23,2019,194052,0.011629192431943358
"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce ABSTRACT The overarching goal of the “Alcoa Study” remains the development of increasingly rich models to explain the disparate health and work-capacity trajectories demonstrated in this universally insured, geographically, socially and economically diverse cohort of 200,000+ men and women as they progress from work-life into retirement. Outcomes of focus remain incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to 1) early life social context via Census data; 2) personal and family work experience and income across the life span via IRS and SSA; 3) post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI) and 4) contextual social environment from lifetime residential geocoding. Consequently, we propose in the next cycle to embrace a life course approach to study the social, environmental and behavioral determinants of the outcomes listed above The specific aims of this grant are: Aim 1: Link Alcoa workers to individual census records to examine how early life environment influences later life health outcomes; Aim 2: Assess the impact on health and function of adverse working environment as it accrues during work-life, with an emphasis on ubiquitous physical hazards; Aim 3: Identify antecedents of short-term and long-term disability across working life as candidates for subsequent hypothesis testing; Aim 4: Assess the impact disability benefits have on employee work function and health; Aim 5: Examine how injuries and health shocks affect retirement savings and subsequent health trajectories; Aim 6: To address generalizability across studies and populations, compare the Alcoa population to relevant complementary datasets, administrative and survey. Viewed altogether, continuation of the Alcoa study with the assembled team of investigators provides an unparalleled opportunity to address a host of critical empiric and methodologic issues previously unapproachable. In addition to understanding better which occupational exposures contribute to chronic disease and disability, these data will allow us to control for economic and other contextual factors to an extraordinary degree. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Alcoa research infrastructure—linking quantitative exposure measures to myriad hazards of active workers whose behavior, social environment and health status from pre-employment through retirement to death are fully observed—provides a unique opportunity to extend our work on the outcomes of focus including incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to early life social context, personal and family work experience and income and post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI).","Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce",9724298,R01AG026291,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Disability Insurance', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Occupational Health', 'Outcome', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Price', 'Privatization', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Shock', 'Social Environment', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Veterans', 'Vietnam', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disability impact', 'experience', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'study population', 'uptake']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,706675,0.020844228383042958
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Exploiting Voice Assistant Systems for Early Detection of Cognitive Decline Early detection of the cognitive decline involved in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD)  in older adults living alone is essential for developing, planning, and initiating interventions and support  systems to improve patients' everyday function and quality of life. Conventional, clinic-based methods for  early diagnosis are expensive, time-consuming, and impracticalfor large-scale screening. This project aims to develop a low-cost, passive, and practical home-based assessment method using Voice Assistant  Systems (VAS) for early detection of cognitive decline, including a set of novel data mining techniques for  sparse time-series speech. The project has three specific aims: 1. Using a recurrent neural network  (RNN) and a softmax regression model, we will develop a transfer learning technique to investigate the  link between the speech from in-lab VAS tasks and cognitive decline. The Pitt corpus from the  DementiaBank database will be used to optimize the RNN parameters and thereby overcome the limited  data problem of VAS. The softmax regression model will allow us to align the feature distributions from the  previous speech data and in-lab VAS speech. 2. We will develop a novel ""many-to-difference"" prediction  model with a symmetric RNN structure to predict the cognitive difference at two ends of a time period from  the sparse time-series data. The proposed model is different from previous ones as the learning focus is  shifted from the short-term pattern differences across users to the pattern difference over time for an  individual user. The proposed model accommodates well for the highly dynamic nature of the inputs and  maximally removes individual characteristics from the prediction result. To analyze the sparse time-series  speech, a new data sampling technique will be used to address the imbalanced data problem, and a data  quality metric will be developed for the proposed model. 3. The team will conduct an 18-month in-lab  evaluation and a 28-month in-home evaluation with a focus on whether the VAS tasks and features from  the in-lab evaluation and the repetition features of the in-home VAS data can measure and predict  cognitive decline in the in-home participants over time. The proposed methods will be integrated into an  interactive system to enable efficient communication on cognitive decline among patients, caregivers, and  clinicians. If successful, the outcomes of this project will provide an opportun ity to provide supportive  evidence to clinicians for the early detection of cognitive impairment outside of a clinic-based setting. This project aims to develop a low-cost, passive, and practical cognitive assessment method using Voice  Assistant Systems (VAS) for early detection of cognitive decline. If successful, the proposed system may  be widely disseminated for the early diagnosis of cognitive impairment to complement existing diagnostic  modalities that could ultimately enable long-term patient and caregiver planning to maintain individual's  independence at home.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Exploiting Voice Assistant Systems for Early Detection of Cognitive Decline,9977514,R01AG067416,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Voice', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'improved', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'recurrent neural network', 'screening']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS BOSTON,R01,2019,300000,-0.06931925633822833
"Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population Project Summary This project will enhance and develop the only source of data that provides core information about work, education, income, and migration for the entire U.S. population. This unique resource allows us to observe today's late-life population when they were young. This allows a prospective view of the impact of early-life environments and socioeconomic status on health and well-being in later life. The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3. Apply new technologies to democratize access to the data through new data access tools and a virtual data  enclave for a restricted version of the data that contains names. This project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging.

This view is supported by neuroimaging, including a series of studies by the Co-PIs, which consistently find a combination of reduced thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor-thalamic hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While significant progress has been made, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the normal developmental trajectory of thalamocortical networks and onset of connectivity disturbances in psychosis; relationship between cognitive functions supported by thalamocortical circuits and thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers; and clinical utility of imaging thalamocortical networks. The availability of several large-scale cross-sectional datasets containing multi-modal neuroimaging data and extensive phenotypic data on healthy and at-risk individuals has created an unprecedented opportunity to address these critical knowledge gaps. They include the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN: n=656, ages 18-88); Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI- RS: n=932, ages 6-85); Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics dataset (PING: N=1239, ages 3-20); Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC: n=1601, ages 8-21), which includes psychosis spectrum (PS) youth; and the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS: n=397). Building on our prior work in clinical populations and leveraging the considerable resources of these datasets, we propose to chart the development of thalamocortical networks in healthy subjects (Aim 1) and youth with PS symptoms (Aim 2), characterize the associations between thalamocortical biomarkers and cognition (Aim 3), and investigate the clinical utility of thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers at identifying atypical brain development in individual subjects across the psychosis continuum and predicting conversion to psychosis in clinical high risk individuals (Aim 4). The proposed Aims will: 1) establish critical normative lifespan development data for refining and testing etiological models of not just psychosis, but other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as aging- related disorders; 2) inform the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders and contribute to dimensional models of psychosis; 3) help define the neural basis of executive cognitive abilities thereby providing the necessary foundation for mechanistic models of normal cognitive function and cognitive impairment in psychosis; and 4) potentially provide risk biomarkers and intervention targets for youth at risk for developing a psychotic disorder. Public Health Relevance: Many psychiatric disorders emerge between childhood and early adulthood, a period when the brain is undergoing significant developmental changes, and are associated with cognitive impairment which leads to lifelong limitations in psychosocial functioning. Determining how and when premorbid brain development goes awry, clarifying the neural basis of cognitive impairment, and establishing the clinical utility of brain-based biomarkers at predicting illness onset in individuals at high risk for neuropsychiatric illness are essential to developing targeted interventions that prevent the onset of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.",Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis,9710707,R01MH115000,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age effect', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'symptomatology', 'young adult']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,369864,-0.015518820825008753
"Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Extensive progress was made in the previous funding period of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We 1) elucidated the neuropathologic basis of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD), 2) discovered genomic, experiential, psychological, and medical risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits including numerous risk factors for Alzheimer’s dementia with little to no relationship with ADRD brain pathologies, and 3) identified numerous potential novel therapeutic targets for cognitive decline, especially targets for cognitive decline not explained by common brain pathologies i.e., resilience. Here, the average person has average resilience and individuals can be more or less resilient. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target because if druggable it would offset the effects of any combination of brain pathologies. In this funding cycle, we propose to continue to follow MAP participants and conduct autopsies, and in this cycle, to obtain skin biopsies at autopsy to support a powerful new drug discovery program that integrates existing brain omics data with a new human cellular model of disease, i.e., skin derived fibroblast cultures induced into neuronal lines from persons with more or less resilience. We propose to: 1) define a robust and specific molecular signature of resilience in the human brain; 2) identify gene targets of resilience and establish human low-resilience cell models derived from MAP participants of known resilience; and 3) conduct drug discovery screens in the low-resilience models to identify compounds that increase resilience. These aims are supported by compelling preliminary work. An Exploratory Aim will continue to identify risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits leveraging the rich resource generated from the exposure data, repeated measures, and neuropathologic traits . All aims will examine sex as a biologic variable. A Secondary Aim will continue to share the unique and valuable resources generated by MAP including the to-be-generated fibroblast cell lines with the scientific community. Harnessing mechanisms of resilience to ADRD can slow down or prevent cognitive decline regardless of the presence and complexity of common brain pathologies. Therefore, the genes and compounds identified from our study will provide new therapeutic remedies to boost brain reserve in combating ADRD-related dementia. We believe that the proposed continuation will have a high and sustained impact on the field of aging and dementia research. POJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The identification of novel therapeutics to prevent of cognitive decline, MCI and Alzheimer’s dementia is a major public health priority. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target with the potential to maintain cognition regardless of the type and number of brain pathologies. The proposed continuation of MAP will identify genes and compounds that affect a molecular signature of resilience in a novel human cell model of disease from autopsied MAP partic ipants .",Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging,9917201,R01AG017917,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Funding', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Persons', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-3', 'base', 'combat', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'human model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'sex', 'therapeutic target', 'trait']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,2825827,-0.013470611732783843
"Concussion and Driving Skills in the Young Driver PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research Objectives. This prospective cohort study rigorously examines the neurocognitive impact of concussion on simulated and real-world driving performance among young drivers aged 16-24 years. Importance. Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving. Unlike new “Return to Learn” guidelines, there are no evidence-based “Return to Drive” guidelines for when individuals with concussion may be safe to return to driving. Objectives. Conduct a prospective matched cohort study to explore the risk of concussion in simulated and real-world driving conditions. We propose three specific aims and a fourth exploratory aim:  (i) Examine whether concussion negatively impacts simulated driving performance among young  drivers, relative to a cohort of young drivers without concussion.  (ii) Determine whether simulated driving task performance correlates with recovery from  concussion symptoms and signs in the month following concussion, relative to young drivers  without recent concussion.  (iii) Measure the impact of concussion and recovery on real-world driving exposure and performance.  (iv) [Exploratory] Examine whether concussion symptoms and neuropsychometric impairment are  associated with higher rates of driving citations or reported crashes. Study design. Prospective controlled matched cohort study. Setting/participants. 50 drivers with recent concussion; 50 age/gender matched controls aged 16-25 years. Study protocol. Concussion participants will be recruited within two weeks of concussion. Case and control participants will complete 1) driving risk survey; 2) neuropsychological testing an 3) simulated driving tasks at baseline and 1 month. Commercially available monitoring technology will record risky driving for 3 months Outcome measures. (i) simulated driving risk scores; (ii) real world driving risk scores (rapid braking, rapid acceleration, speeding); (iii) reported citations and crash rates. Impact. This study will have a significant population health impact in elucidating the neurocognitive sequelae of recent concussion on driving. Results will inform return to safe driving among young drivers with concussion. PROJECT NARRATIVE Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving.

"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9729825,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,173441,0.032208616402735424
"Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders Project Summary: Early life psychosocial adversity and stress are well-established as the most powerful environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes in children. Impairments in developing emotion regulation and cognitive control and associated alterations in brain development have been shown to mediate the effects of adversity on risk for the development of psychopathology. Early psychosocial adversity impacts the epigenetic and inflammation-mediated processes that contribute to these negative outcomes, a process known as “biological embedding of stress.” While this risk trajectory has been clearly linked to increased rates of psychopathology, the mechanisms of this process, its targetable mediators and how early in development they operate are yet to be determined. Here we focus on the effects of early life adversity on brain, emotion regulation and cognitive control outcomes relevant to risk for mental disorders, beginning antenatally and extending to age 3. We will examine the role of pre- and postnatal adversity/stress, the maternal and child perinatal gut microbiome and early caregiver support on these key neurodevelopmental outcomes utilizing state-of-the-art neuroimaging. Our unifying hypothesis is that these factors modulate systemic inflammatory responses, induce neuronal effects through this and other processes that adversely impact brain development in limbic and cortical regions, and mediate the effects of early adversity on child emotion regulation, cognitive control and mental health outcomes. These factors will be studied in a unique, prospectively ascertained cohort of 370 mothers and their offspring at high psychosocial risk being recruited as part of an already funded March of Dimes project at Washington University. The cohort will include both term- and prematurely-born infants and toddlers given the increased risk of psychosocial adversity and aberrant gut microbiome in preterm children. The offspring will be intensively prospectively studied from the 1st trimester to age 3, providing a unique dataset in which to examine the interrelationships among pre- and postnatal adversity, biomarkers of inflammation, the gut microbiome and developmental and mental health outcomes. The perinatal and early childhood periods are critical times to study these exposures as adverse neurodevelopment associated with adversity begins in utero through fetal programming. Likewise, the perinatal period is a critical developmental window for microbial influences, when gut microbial colonization has its most enduring effects. The proposed study merges established research groups in these areas in a center with advanced infant and childhood neuroimaging and extensive microbiome expertise, and offers an unprecedented opportunity to understand the mechanisms of the biological embedding of adversity on brain, cognitive and emotional trajectories in a high-risk cohort. We will also apply innovative computational methods, using Deep Learning, to extend understanding of these data. Findings will provide critical and novel insights to inform early preventive interventions relevant to emotional, cognitive and mental health outcomes for children at greatest risk. Project Narrative This study will investigate the mechanisms by which psychosocial adversity experienced in utero and early in life impact the child’s brain, cognitive and emotional development, testing the hypothesis that stress and adversity during pregnancy adversely affect early brain development through inflammatory mechanisms. Another important focus of this project is to examine how the maternal perinatal microbiome and infant’s gut microbiome during early childhood impact brain development, either through the infant’s inflammatory response or other effects. A third focus is to explore the effects of caregiver support on this risk trajectory, testing the idea that high caregiver support reduces the negative influences of early adversity, altered immune biomarkers and disruptions in the gut microbiome.","Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders",9701281,R01MH113883,"['3 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caregiver support', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Funding', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informal Social Control', 'Instruction', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mothers', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Poverty', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'antenatal', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'gray matter', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiome', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal period', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,2374629,-0.005704441230057973
"Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging. Age-related cognitive decline is a problem of growing importance given the trend toward increased lifespan and the importance of cognitive function in determining risk for neurodegenerative disease. Despite the importance of this problem, the cognitive and molecular changes that mediate it are still poorly understood. While there are competing theories for the mediators of cognitive aging at both psychological and molecular levels, theories on aging and the research supporting them have typically focused on a single level of analysis. As our understanding of the biological basis for behavior grows, this divide becomes less sensible. Instead, psychological theory should be constrained according to its known biology, and biology should in turn inform psychological theory. Here I propose to learn neural network modeling and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in order to bridge human psychological theory that has been the focus of my recent work to the molecular level theory that was the focus of my post-baccalaureate training at the NIA. I will build from my recent work that highlights a key statistical problem faced by the brain: how to selectively pool information across relevant sources but partition information across irrelevant ones. I will closely examine the cognitive and molecular mechanisms that allow for efficient pooling and partitioning to test the overarching theory that, due to impaired glutamate and dopamine signaling, older adults develop a selective deficit in pooling relevant sources of information. I will test this theory in two separate paradigms: visual working memory (K99) and learning and perceptual inference (R00). During the K99 phase of the award I will examine how pooling information from visual targets with similar features can 1) improve effective memory capacity, 2) be achieved by a neural network model, and 3) be impaired by simulated molecular deficiencies (glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine). This bridge between cognitive and molecular levels of analysis will be used to test whether age-related memory deficits are due to inefficient pooling and mediated by molecular deficits in glutamate and dopamine (as measured through MRS and behavioral proxy, respectively). During the R00 phase of the award I will use the training in neural networks and MRS provided in the K99 phase to examine how 1) pooling sequential pieces of information affects learning and perceptual bias, 2) efficient pooling and partitioning can be achieved by a neural network model and 3) these processes are disrupted by specific molecular deficiencies. The established relationships between statistical properties (sequential pooling and partitioning), psychological measurements (learning and perceptual bias) and molecular factors (glutamate, dopamine, and norepinephrine signaling levels) will be used to test whether age-related differences in learning and perceptual bias reflect deficient pooling mediated by local glutamate deficiency (as measured through MRS). Overall, this work will contribute a deeper and more detailed understanding of the psychological and molecular factors that interact to mediate age-related cognitive decline. In addition, the K99 training will provide me the tools necessary to link psychological and molecular levels of analysis and the R00 phase will build the foundations of my independent research laboratory allowing me to develop a successful scientific career driven by experiments that build and refine a unified understanding of cognitive aging. Project Narrative This project will explore how changes to basic information processing in the brain occurring over the course of healthy aging may contribute to age-related deficits in learning and memory. The work will also examine the biological underpinnings of these changes and may inform future research into interventions that could slow the cognitive aging process.",Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging.,9991267,R00AG054732,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Arousal', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Comparative Study', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Dopamine', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Foundations', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Norepinephrine', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Psychological Theory', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'comparative', 'emerging adult', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'information processing', 'lens', 'neural network', 'psychobiology', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'visual information', 'young adult']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,248994,0.005520518927943531
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming.

Children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) suffer from subtle cognitive impairments and structural alterations in the brain. These impairments progress with age and may eventually lead to increased difficulty managing the disease, resulting in worsening glycemic control, potentially life-threatening complications, and reductions in quality of life. Causes of cognitive decline in T1D are not well understood. Episodes of hypoglycemia, chronic hyperglycemia, glycemic variability and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) have all been suggested to play roles. Increased understanding of factors linked to cognitive decline in T1D, and the mechanisms responsible for these associations, is essential such that interventions to preserve cognition could be proposed. Recent data suggest that neuroinflammation resulting from hyperglycemia and episodes of DKA may be play a prominent role in causing cognitive decline. There is also evidence that modifiable factors such as nutrition, exercise, and sleep quality might modulate effects of chronic neuroinflammation and influence cognitive outcomes. In this project, we will engage in efforts to plan a comprehensive study of factors associated with cognition in children with T1D. At the completion of the proposed planning project, we will be prepared to conduct a longitudinal cohort study of children with newly diagnosed T1D. This study will determine how glycemic control and DKA exposure predict altered brain structure and cognition and establish whether markers of neuronal injury and inflammatory processes explain these longitudinal relations. Proposed assessments will include T1D-related factors (glycemic control, glycemic variability, hypoglycemia, DKA), brain structure and cognitive function (attention, memory and IQ). In addition, we will plan measurements of inflammatory mediators and markers of neuroinflammation using blood assays (cytokine measurements, exosome analyses, RNA microarrays), and evaluate factors that might modify inflammation such as diet (nutrient content), sleep quality and exercise. To optimize the study design, we will utilize the expertise of a multidisciplinary team to develop the study protocol, including experts in pediatric diabetes, cognitive development, neural and systemic inflammation, MR imaging, nutrition, sleep medicine, and data science. The team will work together to finalizing the protocol, work-flow and outcome measures, and identify the necessary computational infrastructure and data analysis strategies. The team will also assess study feasibility (factors affecting enrollment success and tolerance of the protocol) and determine necessary sample size by evaluating variability in biochemical and imaging measures. Alternative approaches to increase participant retention, such as remote (online) versus in person cognitive testing, will be explored. At the conclusion of this planning project, we will have developed and optimized a protocol to explore factors associated with cognitive decline in children with T1D, laying a foundation for future studies aimed at preserving cognitive function. Narrative. Individuals with type 1 diabetes often have declines in cognitive function over time, with a high risk of cognitive impairments and dementia as older adults. The physiological events responsible for cognitive damage in T1D are not understood, and it is unclear how cognitive decline might be prevented. In the proposed project, we will plan a comprehensive, multi-center study to investigate factors associated with declines in cognition in children with T1D at onset of the disease and over time.",Planning for a Cohort Study on Neurocognitive Complication of Type 1 Diabetes in Children,9913812,U34DK123894,"['10 year old', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Antibodies', 'Attention', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Brain Injuries', 'Child', 'Childhood diabetes', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Diet', 'Disease Management', 'Elderly', 'Encephalitis', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family dynamics', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nutrient', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'RNA', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'computer infrastructure', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'dementia risk', 'diet and exercise', 'exosome', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'inflammatory marker', 'insulin dependent diabetes mellitus onset', 'long term memory', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuron loss', 'non-diabetic', 'nutrition', 'participant retention', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'secondary outcome', 'sleep quality', 'success']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U34,2019,366502,0.00923590213174753
"Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys 7. Abstract.  The ability to identify and follow-up neurobiological changes that occur during brain maturation and aging is not only fundamental to our understanding of cognition, but is also crucial for clinical studies that focus on either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, including clinical trials. While post-mortem studies provide data that are well characterized in terms of localized histological changes, these data can be limited due to their cross sectional nature and small samples sizes. In contrast, non-invasive in vivo imaging allows for the collection of longitudinal data in much larger populations, and is a more powerful tool to investigate life span trajectories of brain maturation and aging. Recent developments in neuroimaging have provided evidence for the relationship between imaging changes and cognitive aging in monkeys, and humans. Unfortunately, the cellular underpinnings of cognitive age are a subject of debate and hence the biological specificity of available imaging measures is not well established. More alarming, while older imaging measures still lack thorough validation, newer “more specific” measures that are being constantly introduced into clinical research are even further from validation. Over the past funding period, we have worked with a large repository of histological, cognitive and imaging legacy data from cognitively aging rhesus monkeys, testing the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and myelin degeneration play crucial roles in cognitive aging, and that neuroimaging biomarkers can reflect those biological processes. We propose to further our work in this direction, by proposing translational experiments that will include 1). acquiring new, high resolution “Human Connectome Project (HCP)” compatible imaging data, 2). Expand our neuroimaging by adding neuroinflammation- and myelin-specific PET radioligands, 3). Develop neuroimaging white matter-specific biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment- a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and 4). Investigate biological underpinnings of sex differences in aging. This is enabled by a collaboration of three PIs, with unique and complementary expertise in MRI imaging, morphometry, neuroanatomy, immunohistochemistry and cognitive aging, and will be further facilitated by acquiring and analyzing behavioral, imaging, blood and post mortem data from a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys of both sexes, 8 young adults (4 males and 4 females) and 16 old adults (8 males and 8 females, half diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. 8. Project Narrative. The three PIs and their co-investigators propose a multidisciplinary study of cognitive aging in rhesus monkeys. We plan to acquire new, state of the art imaging data, and combine it with cognitive assessments, blood measures, and postmortem brain tissue to explore the biological underpinnings and establish the specificity of the imaging biomarkers to neurobiology of cognitive aging. The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many other clinical populations including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases of central nervous system.",Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys,9817776,R01AG042512,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Astrocytes', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cell Aging', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Ligands', 'Longevity', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuroglia', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Specificity', 'Spin Labels', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Work', 'age related', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'juvenile animal', 'male', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'myelin degeneration', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuroinflammation', 'radioligand', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change', 'young adult']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,891796,0.02387060231731467
"A preconception cohort study of environmental chemicals, fertility, and miscarriage ABSTRACT Infertility and spontaneous abortion (SAB) are significant public health problems, affecting up to 25% of reproductive age couples in the United States. Health care costs attributable to infertility and SAB exceed $5 billion per year, and several studies have shown an association between infertility treatments and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors for subfertility and SAB is an important public health goal. The potential effects of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on risk of subfertility and SAB are understudied. The few existing human studies have limitations including small sample size, enrollment after conception, retrospective study design, suboptimal assessment of exposure and outcome, inadequate control for potential confounding variables, and limited generalizability. The proposed study will prospectively assess the relation of exposure to selected EDCs, including phenols, phthalates, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), to risk of subfertility and SAB in a preconception subcohort of 950 pregnancy planners. We will use data from two NICHD-supported prospective cohorts of pregnancy planners in North America and Denmark. With web-based recruitment and data collection, we have enrolled over 17,000 women attempting pregnancy into these cohorts. In a subset of 200 participants, we have successfully pilot tested in-person collection of urine and blood specimens during the preconception and early pregnancy periods. In this application, we propose to expand in-person biospecimen collection, increasing the number of women with preconception and early pregnancy urine and blood samples from 200 to 950. At each of our three biospecimen collection sites (Boston, Detroit, and Aarhus), we will enroll 250 women and collect three urine samples and one blood sample (in preconception) and three urine samples and one blood sample (in early pregnancy). We will ship the samples to the CDC for the analysis of urinary phthalates, urinary phenols, and serum PFAS. To increase cost efficiency, we will pool three urine samples in each exposure window before assaying for phthalates and phenols; and we will assay one preconception blood specimen for PFAS, a persistent chemical, in analyses of subfertility and SAB. Finally, we will conduct a pilot study among 100 U.S. participants to assess the feasibility of collecting urine by mail, which would allow us to take advantage of our full geographically-diverse cohort in the future. Strengths of this application include the prospective design, preconception enrollment of pregnancy planners, repeated measurement of exposure during preconception and early pregnancy, excellent control for confounding via bimonthly prospective data collection on a wide range of covariates, and use of the latest analytic methods for mixtures modeling. We have generated compelling preliminary data to support our aims. The present grant is cost-effective in leveraging already-established cohort studies with data collection and follow-up supported by other grants. The results generated will be translatable by directly informing future regulatory decisions about EDC standards in a manner that could reduce rates of infertility and SAB. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nearly 15% of all couples have difficulty becoming pregnant and up to 25% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. Infertility and miscarriage can cause profound psychological and financial hardship for those affected, and they account for more than 5 billion dollars in U.S. health care costs each year. Identifying modifiable risk factors for infertility and miscarriage, including environmental pollutants (phenols, phthalates, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances), is an important public health goal.","A preconception cohort study of environmental chemicals, fertility, and miscarriage",9638779,R01ES029951,"['Acids', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Benzophenones', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Boston', 'Canada', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Conceptions', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Cost efficiency', 'Couples', 'Cyclohexanes', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Denmark', 'Dicarboxylic Acids', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Esters', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Financial Hardship', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Infertility', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratory Study', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'North America', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parabens', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phenols', 'Pilot Projects', 'Poly-fluoroalkyl substances', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Probability', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Serum', 'Ships', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Sum', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'aged', 'analytical method', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'chemical standard', 'child bearing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'early pregnancy', 'early pregnancy loss', 'environmental chemical', 'follow-up', 'health goals', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infertility treatment', 'innovation', 'male', 'modifiable risk', 'phthalates', 'pregnant', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'subfertility', 'time-to-pregnancy', 'trying to conceive', 'urinary']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2019,632737,0.007548597044457508
"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Many older adults experience declines in cognitive ability that can be substantial, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Population aging, coupled with age-related cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, represents an unprecedented challenge. Early detection of cognitive impairment is a crucial goal. This would allow individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment and/or AD/ADRD to adopt lifestyle changes to minimize decrements and the risk for acquired cognitive impairment. However, the massive potential of cognitive training and longitudinal assessment to detect and prevent age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are unlikely to be realized unless individuals are willing and able to engage with these protocols for an extended period of time. Adherence to cognitive assessment and training is often poor. Addressing the gap between potential and realized benefits of early detection and prevention of cognitive impairment is an urgent goal as the population ages. The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia by 1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols, 2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence, and 3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures. Projects aim to investigate these issues within samples of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials will test an adaptive, tailored, and integrated technology support system predicted to boost adherence to cognitive protocols, over and above a simpler scheduling and reminder system over 6 months. Studies will provide valuable and generalizable insight into not only the benefits of adherence support, but also the individual difference factors that shape protocol adherence (e.g., attitudes, cognitive ability, dementia status, health status, personality, technology proficiency). Data will inform the process of identifying individuals who would benefit from additional support, and predicting and preventing extended adherence failures before they happen. By increasing adherence, these studies will help improve early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, which will ultimately extend older adults' functional independence, improving their lives and the lives of their families, and reducing care and support resources needed to address lost independence like that associated with Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Further, intervention studies for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can be made more efficient through tools for identifying individuals likely to experience decline before substantial cognitive impairment has occurred. Results have implications that extend far beyond cognitive impairment; the methods and mechanisms uncovered have broad implications for technology-mediated assessment and protocols to enhance health and well-being in general. The project consists of two large randomized controlled trials and smaller needs assessment and usability studies that will guide their development and deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia. This project will develop Artificial Intelligence-based reminder systems to help ensure long-term engagement to home-based cognitive assessment and cognitive training protocols to be able to detect and treat cognitive impairment as soon as possible.",The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline,9801140,R01AG064529,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Life Style', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Weight', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cognitive training', 'design', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'improved', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile computing', 'next generation', 'person centered', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,554286,-0.034782259808522335
"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions. Our proposed work will be significant as it will provide epidemiologists with a novel and robust tool to assess exposure to environmental pollutant mixtures. Project Narrative We are constantly exposed to a mixture of environmental pollutants at once, but current epidemiologic methods either assess each pollutant separately, not capturing reality, or have severe limitations. With this study we propose to adapt a wildly popular method used in computer vision applications, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), and develop flexible extensions for many epidemiologic settings. We propose to assess the performance of this method, compare with existing methods and employ in real-life applications, as well as develop and share software so other research can also use this novel, robust and flexible tool.",Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies,9617736,R01ES028805,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency Situation', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Poison', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Work', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'policy implication', 'pollutant', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,600285,0.0643844599903189
"Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management Project Summary/Abstract Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation and our partners propose to develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) system for persons with dementia (PWD),(mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, or other dementias), who are living in assisted living facilities. The proposed system uses Augmented Intelligence (AI) to communicate with the PWD in natural language. The system's goals are three-fold. First, the system helps PWD transition from living in their homes to ALFs by fostering relationships and conveying schedules. Second, the system enables PWD to age in place by addressing the challenges that often lead to an escalation of care (i.e., nursing homes). Third, the system engages PWD via activities such as storytelling and simple games. We will integrate the proposed SAR system with current assistive technology, which is based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and quality of life in PWD. A strong multi-disciplinary team of engineers, academic experts in SAR and PWD, and a commercialization partner has been assembled to achieve these goals. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases affecting an estimated 5.3 million Americans at a cost of $236 billion. Social assistive robots can be used to lessen levels of depression, loneliness, grief, fear, and frustration as dementia progresses improving mental health and quality of life. In addition to improved quality of life, persons with dementia may be able to extend the amount of time in assisted living before being forced to a much costlier higher level of care such as a nursing home.",Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management,10012469,R44AG058337,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fostering', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Health', 'Hobbies', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information and Media', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Loneliness', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'body language', 'cognitive computing', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'robot interface', 'social', 'social assistive robot', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2019,1908341,-0.02548032135850294
"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives.

"Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT The overarching goals of this R01 proposal are to improve scientific understanding of potential mechanisms by which ophthalmic diseases lead to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will leverage modern ophthalmic data with state-of-the-art imaging and extensive archived clinical data from a well-characterized cohort of older adults. The investigators propose to examine the effect of structural and functional changes in retina and longitudinal severity of ophthalmic diseases on Alzheimer’s disease and related neuropathology. The proposal builds on the resources of the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, a prospective longitudinal, population-based, dementia-free cohort of over 5,500 people to date established in 1994 which has detected >1,014 research quality diagnoses of Alzheimer’s disease and >1,254 dementia to date. ACT follows consenting participants to autopsy and has performed state-of-the arts autopsy on >781 decedents to date. In this extremely well-characterized cohort, the investigators found that several ophthalmic diseases (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration) are significantly associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will use three advanced ophthalmic imaging modalities at both home and clinical research study visits: fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and OCT angiography (OCTA), to obtain quantitative data relevant to these ophthalmic diseases. The study team will establish the distribution (Aim 1a) and 2- and 4-year evolution of ophthalmic imaging characteristics found in older adults in the community and determine associations with change in cognition (Aim 1 b, c). Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI angiography (MRA) will be obtained in a subset of participants to investigate the contribution of small (retinal) and large (cerebral) vascular disease towards cognitive changes (Aim 1d). The study team will continue ACT study’s strong commitment for meaningful data sharing. In collaboration with the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging at University of Southern California, the study team will promulgate these ophthalmic data in addition to neuroimaging data to the research community (Aim 1e). In Aim 2, the investigators will use extensive clinical ophthalmology data captured over many decades and incorporate them in novel longitudinal models of eye disease severity. The investigators will analyze eye disease severity along with extensive neuropathology data from the ACT study, including both standard (Aim 2a) and novel quantitative (Aim 2b) neuropathology data, to further scientific understanding of neuropathological mechanisms underlying associations between eye conditions and Alzheimer’s disease risk. The brain is not amenable to direct observations during life. In contrast, the eye is an anterior extension of the central nervous system and may provide a valuable window to illuminate neurodegenerative processes in the aging brain. Proposed investigations will substantially enhance scientific understanding of the role of modern ophthalmic evaluations in delineating risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of neuropathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using a large, well-characterized, longitudinal, prospective, cohort study, the study team previously found that diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration were significantly associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk. The team proposes to use three cutting edge ophthalmic imaging modalities to obtain quantitative data at both home and clinic research study visits in addition to MRI and MRA in a subset of participants to evaluate their associations with change in cognition over time (Aim 1). The team will leverage extensive ophthalmic clinical and neuropathological data already available for 781 study participants to date as well as new state-of-the-art quantitative measures of beta amyloid (A1-42) and phosphorylated tau to elucidate mechanisms underlying associations between ophthalmic conditions and Alzheimer’s disease (Aim 2).",Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study,9816310,R01AG060942,"['Abbreviations', 'Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Angiography', 'Anterior', 'Archives', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neuraxis', 'Occipital lobe', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Selection Bias', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'area striata', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis quality', 'epidemiology study', 'fiber cell', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'population based', 'prospective', 'repository', 'research study', 'resilience', 'spelling', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'vascular contributions']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,3869686,-0.05605200681086525
"Smartphone phenotype collection for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment Project Summary This project addresses a critical need for early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and other Alzheimer's-related dementias (ADRD). Advances in smartphone hardware, computer vision, and machine learning have enabled the possibility of producing smartphone-based cognitive testing applications able to collect electronic sensor data and transform it into highly informative phenotypes that can serve as early indicators of future disease progression. In this project, we aim to develop a revolutionary new smartphone- based cognitive testing platform, called CTX, that will enable the rapid development and deployment of smartphone-based tests that can capture raw sensor streams in a synchronized fashion, subsample and compress the combined streams, and transmit them to a cloud server for subsequent analysis and modeling. CTX will provide a high-level application development framework that will significantly reduce the time and technical knowledge required to produce a smartphone-based cognitive testing application by providing an application programming interface (API) that enables developers to simply declare what sensor data should be collected and when. The framework will handle all the details of collecting the sensor data, synchronizing it, and transmitting it to a back-end server. The API will also have a variety of other high-level features to facilitate development of cognitive test apps. To demonstrate the feasibility of our vision for CTX, in Aim 1 of this project we will develop the software framework, back-end server software and a prototype smartphone app to exercise and validate many of the platform's features. For Aim 2, we will develop three different tests for this app to test saccade (eye movement) latency, verbal recall, and wrist mobility, each collecting a different type of sensor data (video, audio, and inertial measurement). These tests were selected because their results have been been shown to be predictive of MCI. We will implement phenotype extraction pipelines that employ advanced signal processing, machine learning, and computer vision algorithms to extract the target phenotypes from the sensor data collected for these tests and demonstrate they operate with sufficient accuracy to replicate published experimental designs. Successful completion of this project will eliminate the need for expensive and cumbersome phenotype collection equipment (e.g., eye tracking stations) and create the possibility of generating data from which MCI onset can be predicted. Data collected in Phase II via these and other such tests will enable us to apply our machine learning expertise to produce models able to predict transition to MCI that are both sensitive and specific, transforming any smartphone into an MCI risk assessment tool available for at-home use by millions of people. Project Narrative This NIH Phase I project will address the critical need for early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-related dementias (ADRD) by developing a revolutionary new smartphone-based cognitive testing platform that will provide individuals with an ongoing status of their cognitive health. Doctors who are given access to the results of these tests will be able to monitor patients more closely and provide more timely diagnoses. By studying test results from many people, researchers may someday be able to identify patterns that can distinguish mild cognitive impairment from normative age-related cognitive decline.",Smartphone phenotype collection for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment,9679400,R43AG062072,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Apple', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Equipment', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Forearm', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rotation', 'Saccades', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Stream', 'Tablets', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Yang', 'age related', 'age related cognitive change', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cloud platform', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'data modeling', 'diagnostic screening', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'success']",NIA,"PARABON NANOLABS, INC.",R43,2018,394297,-0.024582832462804845
"Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment SUMMARY Detecting the first and earliest stages of cognitive decline, conceptualized as “mild cognitive impairment” (MCI), has become increasingly important in recent years, as research focuses on delaying the manifestations of more severe stages of decline. It is now well recognized that changes in performance on cognitive tests begin up to ten years (or longer) before clinically apparent symptoms of dementia or functional impairment appear. Conventional assessment methods for assessing cognition Conventional assessment methods typically use the spoken response modality in which subjects are asked to verbally respond to prompts, and examiners carefully listen to these responses and apply test manuals to compute scores. These assessment methods require trained specialists and can be burdensome because they need to performed in clinics, especially so with frequent reassessment. Automating the scoring of assessment is important, not only for alleviating this burden but also for enabling large-scale studies on new intervention methods. Our research goal is to automate detection of MCI by developing, applying, and evaluating a system for automation of verbal (i.e., using spoken responses) cognitive-test scoring. Focusing on four verbal cognitive tests, we develop an extensible system comprising ASR and machine-learning algorithms to automatically score responses, and measure the efficacy of our proposed method by validating the accuracy of the automatically obtained scores against gold-standard, clinically obtained scores (Aim 1). Next, we develop classification methods for detecting individuals with MCI based on all information available in the verbal responses, and validating this classification against gold-standard clinical consensus. NARRATIVE Early detection of mild cognitive disease (MCI) is significantly important to delay more severe stages of cognitive decline. Conventional assessment methods require trained specialists and can be financially beyond the reach of most. We propose a tool for automatically scoring verbal cognitive tests. The proposed tool can be embedded in electronic devices providing the opportunity to assess large number of people in their homes, enabling clinicians to focus on those who are most at risk of cognitive decline.",Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment,9531223,R21AG055749,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Automation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Vascular Cognitive Impairment', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'response', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,187784,0.009050090825305897
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome.

"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture.

Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health,9517056,K99ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K99,2018,98444,0.017800453913186128
"Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Environmental exposure mixtures, especially when coupled with social stressors, have the potential to compromise developmental outcomes in children, but have been understudied. We will use a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks children from birth through early elementary school, in combination with new tools from modern data science, to disentangle the complex effects of these mixtures on educational outcomes.",Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures,9440248,R01ES028819,"['Address', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Architecture', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Censuses', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Cox Models', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mothers', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nitrogen Dioxide', 'North Carolina', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Ozone', 'Particle Size', 'Particulate Matter', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pollution', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Siblings', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Sulfur Dioxide', 'System', 'Taxes', 'Time', 'Unemployment', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'early childhood', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'indexing', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'pollutant', 'programs', 'rural environment', 'simulation', 'social', 'social stress', 'stressor', 'tool', 'web site']",NIEHS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,506174,0.04163184980240545
"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,9595726,R01AI135115,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladeshi', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholera', 'Cholera Vaccine', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Haiti', 'Haitian', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Household', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sanitation', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Standardization', 'Surveillance Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Vibrio cholerae O1', 'Water', 'age related', 'base', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,750105,0.027722847690841174
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health.

"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,9520444,R01NS086885,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Afghanistan', 'Amnesia', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iraq', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sports', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'concussive symptom', 'executive function', 'gray matter', 'inattention', 'interest', 'mechanical force', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood symptom', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'persistent symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,347813,0.04156488978333522
"Adolescent Personality and the Incidence of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Related Dementias in Later Life. Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s related dementias (ADRD) are now regarded as a public health problem of pressing importance. While the race for disease-altering treatments continues, another strand of work has focused on identifying social and psychological precursors of these conditions. Such biopsychosocial risks often can be traced back to phases of life that predate symptom onset by years or decades. Therefore, a robust social and life course epidemiology of ADRD requires study designs that feature a) broad and deep psychosocial characterization of b) a large, population-relevant cohort c) during early phases of life, with d) medically-documented outcome data. Parent project R01AG053155 features a) through c), specifically in 90,000 members of the Project Talent cohort assessed in 1960 and again in 1970-74. The current supplement expands its scope to all members of Project Talent baseline (roughly 340,000) from 1960, and focuses on two scientific aims. The first seeks to estimate the relative risk of ADRD by the early 70s arising from adolescent personality traits, as documented in Medicare data linked to the cohort. One key feature of this aim is to determine if aspects of personality in adolescence are associated with ADRD incidence in later life independently of adolescent IQ, which is a known predictor. The second key aspect of this aim is to use the size and population representativeness of the sample to derive reasonably precise population-relevant effect size estimates of personality relative risks, and compare these effect sizes to benchmark risk estimates of adolescent IQ and socioeconomic status, which are considered to have policy and public health significance. The second aim also leverages the size and scope of the sample to identify personality traits which may moderate the ADRD risk of low adolescent IQ, in more complex and realistic patterns than can be studied in smaller or less representative data sets. This is accomplished via machine learning methods focused on identifying non-linear interactions via intensive cross-validation, another scientific question that takes full advantage of the size and scope of this unique cohort. Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s related dementias are on the rise, due to both increasing life spans and the size of the Baby Boom generation as it reaches these later years. While scientists have yet to develop cures for dementias, it may be possible to learn how to prevent or delay their onset by studying life circumstances that give rise to these conditions. The goal of this project is to determine how personality traits in adolescence may compensate for the dementia risk posed by low adolescence IQ scores.",Adolescent Personality and the Incidence of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Related Dementias in Later Life.,9688395,R01AG053155,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Baby Booms', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deltastab', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biopsychosocial', 'cohort', 'epidemiologic data', 'exhaustion', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'parent project', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'public health priorities', 'social', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2018,287001,-0.036805834234295336
"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9573304,R01ES027747,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cadmium', 'Carbon', 'Carbon Black', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Membrane', 'Mercury', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Nitrates', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'RNA marker', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Trace Elements', 'Translations', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vesicle', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'ambient air pollution', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'extracellular vesicles', 'follow-up', 'inflammatory marker', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'modifiable risk', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'toxic metal']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2018,755603,0.01493177327539365
"Spatiotemporal Risk Assessment Modeling of Chemical Mixtures Project Summary: Comprehensive exposure assessments that account for mixtures of environmental chemical pollutants are vital to understand true relationships between human exposures and disease outcomes. Moreover, human or daily mobility of people is often misrepresented by exposure models resulting in exposure misclassification. This proposal aims to determine how air pollution chemical mixtures and human mobility impact environmental and human health risk assessments, which aligns with the NIEHS core mission “to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives.” The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. The primary mentor, Dr. Kim Anderson, a professor at Oregon State University is an expert in passive exposure assessment methods and analytical quantification of chemical mixtures in environmental media, which provides an excellent environment to transition the candidate from a background in single-pollutant exposure assessment to multi-pollutant mixture exposure and risk assessment. Along with new teaching opportunities, the candidate will receive training from Dr. Anderson in research methods such as primary data collection, biochemical monitoring for epidemiological studies, and toxicology approaches in risk assessment. Collaborators Drs. Katrina Waters and Justin Teeguarden, senior scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, will provide career development advising and research training in areas such as data integration for epidemiology and toxicology studies and hands-on experience with large-scale computational resources. This proposal’s aims will address the following central hypotheses: (1) Accounting for chemical mixtures in exposure will produce synergistic health effects not observed by chemicals individually, and (2) Personal sampling and model-based exposure assessment accounting for human mobility will produce varying risk estimates depending on the pollutant and individuals’ mobility. During the K99 phase, aim 1 will collect multi-chemical air quality data for a daily time resolved stationary monitoring campaign resulting in a space and time resolved multi-pollutant (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds) air quality dataset. Aim 2 will develop spatiotemporal exposure models for gas-phase mixtures using land use regression, geostatistical, and machine learning models. In the R00 phase, aim 3 will perform a risk assessment for chemical mixtures and acute lung health effects accounting for human mobility using a case-crossover design and comparing three exposure assessment methods: traditional spatiotemporal models, spatiotemporal models accounting for human mobility, and personal exposure monitors. Together, this proposal addresses the major limitations in environmental exposure assessment, pollutant mixtures and human mobility, and is within the mixtures and air pollution focus areas of environmental exposure research at NIEHS. Project Narrative The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. This study will validate spatiotemporal statistical approaches in chemical mixture exposure modelling, evaluate the cumulative effects of chemical mixtures in air pollution and acute lung health effects, and determine the extent of exposure misclassification due to human mobility.

"Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging PROJECT SUMMARY Progressive aging-related cognitive declines are associated with limitations in self-care and functional independence, deteriorating physical health, and impending dementia and mortality, even among the otherwise healthy. Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie cognitive aging is key to developing interventions to prevent or ameliorate cognitive decline. Disconnection theories of aging specifically implicate weakening of structural brain connectivity as a key mechanism of cognitive decline, but until recently, diffusion MRI data and connectomic methods needed to rigorously test such theories have been lacking. To expedite understanding how aging-related changes in the human structural connectome relate to aging-related cognitive declines, we will apply the latest connectomic and multivariate data analysis methods to existing data from two highly unique datasets: (1) The UK Biobank, a cross-sectional sample of ~10,000 40-75 year old adults, who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information; and (2) The Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936, a narrow-age cohort of older adults (baseline age = 73 years; N = 731) who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information on each of three separate occasions, each separated by three years. Using recently developed graph-theoretic models, we will construct structural brain connectome networks for each participant's diffusion MRI data at each wave and extract indices reflective of network topology within several specific networks of interest (NOIs) identified ex ante. We will also identify topologically central hub regions that disproportionately govern efficiency within each individual's connectome network. We will apply cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models to examine aging-related transformations in network indices, examine concurrent and longitudinal coupling between network indices and cognitive abilities, and test predictors of levels and changes in network indices and cognitive abilities. This will allow us to contrast the predictive utility of the selected NOIs for cognitive aging and to identify specific features of network architecture involved in cognitive aging and mediate the effects of demographic, medical, and lifestyle risk factors for cognitive aging. We additionally implement machine- learning methods to estimate an upper bound of prediction of cognitive aging from network indices, and identify novel features of network topology as candidate mechanisms of cognitive decline. The availability of two uniquely large and well-characterized datasets will allow us to ensure that findings are rigorous and reproducible using within sample (holdout) and between sample cross-validation. For all aims, we will place considerable emphasis on testing for incremental validity of network indices relative to both conventional structural neuroanatomical measures and topologically naïve summary indices of network integrity.

"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices1-4. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children5-7. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes8-10. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides11. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures12,13, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized14,15. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid16. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California17-20, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind21,22, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics23 to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,9598047,K99ES028743,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K99,2018,81281,0.03449382434653361
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychopathology arising from a disruption of emotional function affects over 400 million people globally, yet we lack a neurobiological model to guide classification and treatment.

"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,9505590,K01HL141637,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perceived quality of life', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Professional Organizations', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health data', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'patient expectation', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'skills', 'survivorship', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'working group']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,163291,0.00809193266084417
"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes.

"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework,9540891,K99ES027511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'African American', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Future', 'GALA', 'Genetic', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Puerto Rican', 'Randomized', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'analog', 'base', 'career', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'exposure pathway', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'minority children', 'pollutant', 'public health intervention', 'pulmonary function', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social disparities', 'tool']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2018,88012,-0.0200289904069434
"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,9576319,R01AG059729,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caucasians', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Diet', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Freedom', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature aging syndrome', 'Preparation', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'ST14 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'biracial', 'caucasian American', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'disability', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fitness', 'healthy aging', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'male', 'mental state', 'microbial', 'middle age', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sarcopenia', 'walking speed', 'young adult']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,427901,-0.02034090068024027
"Understanding the impact of environmental disruption in biological timing systems through signal processing. Project Summary/Abstract.  Life on Earth evolved to take time cues from the Sun. Consequently, most or all cells in the mammalian body use genetic feedback loops to time their daily (circadian) rhythms. When a person or any mammal sees light, that winds an orchestrating circadian brain clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN in turn helps keep the myriad other tissue and endocrine rhythms in synchrony, enabling health. The modern environment is highly disruptive to this internal synchrony. Light at night from cell phones or urban light pollution, and social impositions like school start times or rotating work shifts all act as “temporal pollution,” causing loss of internal synchrony. The more severe the desynchrony, the higher the risk for a broad range of diseases, including obesity, cancer, infertility, depression and ultimately cognitive decline. Without knowing how these systems normally maintain synchrony or which systems are normally synchronized, it is hard to understand what happens in desynchrony to degrade health. This problem is complicated by the fact that some biological systems have ultradian (every few hours) and infradian (every few days) cycles in addition to circadian cycles. The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) generates ultradian rhythms through negative feedback, but also shows a strong circadian cycle; the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG) shows the same negative feedback ultradian activity, circadian rhythmicity, and also infradian rhythms of ovulation and spermatogenesis. These two axes are regulated by the SCN. Recent work indicates that there is cross-talk between these axes, and that their hormonal outputs - corticosterone, and estradiol (in females) and testosterone (in males), respectively – work to synchronize extra-SCN tissues and behavioral rhythms of feeding and drinking (FaD). Finally, the SCN, HPA, and HPG axes all affect core body temperature (CBT), so that high temporal resolution recordings of CBT contain information about the cycling and synchrony of these systems across time scales.  There are three aims to this proposal, using rats as a model system: 1) Test at high temporal resolution the effects of changes to the HPA axis, HPG axis, and SCN on CBT. 2) Use these relationships to build a model that can back-predict the state of the HPA axis, HPG axis, and SCN from a high temporal resolution CBT record of a given individual. 3) Expose rats to environmental temporal disruption in the form of a 6 h “jetlag” phase advance of the light cycle, and use the model to predict the response across these systems at 1-minute temporal resolution. This work will employ within-animal comparisons before and after surgical and pharmacological manipulations of rats whose FaD, activity, and CBT are captured continuously at 1-minute resolution. These data will be analyzed using signal-processing and machine learning to define patterns and relationships. The resulting model will allow minimally-invasive exploration of environmental disruption across physiological systems in real time. The model will be used to quantify synchrony as it is disrupted and re-emerges, identifying markers for risk or resilience, and generating hypotheses for future work into preventive strategies and treatments. Project Narrative. Artificial lights and social obligation cause people living with modern infrastructure to suffer a loss of synchrony across their organs, which evolved to track the stable day and year light cycles. We know about internal synchrony mostly by the diseases that arise from its loss – everything from cancer to obesity, depression, and infertility. This work will develop a system for tracking the cycles of many body-systems at the same time with minute-to-minute accuracy, allowing rapid detection of desynchrony, and a potential way to study how synchrony works normally, and why its disruption by the modern environment causes disease.",Understanding the impact of environmental disruption in biological timing systems through signal processing.,9567170,K99ES027509,"['Address', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Body Temperature', 'Body Temperature Changes', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Corticosterone', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dysmenorrhea', 'Dyspepsia', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine system', 'Environment', 'Environmental Impact', 'Estradiol', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormonal Change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Jet Lag Syndrome', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Orphan', 'Output', 'Ovulation', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System', 'Planet Earth', 'Pollution', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Rattus', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Obligations', 'Spermatogenesis', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'body system', 'comparative', 'drinking', 'feeding', 'high risk', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'minimally invasive', 'pituitary gonadal axis', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'rapid detection', 'reconstruction', 'resilience', 'response', 'shift work', 'signal processing', 'social', 'suprachiasmatic nucleus', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'time use']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2018,104094,-0.033890754340619805
"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"Interactive Companion Robot for Preventing Neuro-Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's and Other Dementias ABSTRACT  The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing worldwide, placing enormous burdens on healthcare providers, patients and caregivers. Many new treatments are in development and the consensus is that most interventions will need to be initiated as early in the disease progression as possible. Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) has developed sensitive non-invasive EEG biomarkers for early detection of Alzheimer's and evaluating treatment outcomes. The biomarkers are in use in drug trials and are being validated longitudinally in a large population of patients with Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and healthy controls. Patients with MCI are particularly interesting as potential targets for early intervention as MCI is often a transitional state between normal aging and dementia.  This proposal introduces a novel, socially assistive robot (SAR) protocol designed with the goal of slowing the progression of cognitive decline in patients with MCI. The team combines ABM's 15-year success in implementing real-time neuro-sensing and dementia biomarkers with academic and commercial expertise in robot behavioral intervention design. Dr. Maja Mataric, USC Professor, Dr. Cory Kidd, CEO and founder, Catalia Health, and Dr. Schneider, USC Professor, will work with ABM to enable the Mabu robot to interact with participants in their homes and influence healthy habits. Catalia demonstrated that the Mabu software use of artificial intelligence to encourage social interaction improves medical adherence. This project will develop a SAR-mediated intervention for elderly users and MCI patients. Mabu will interact with participants in their homes to encourage and monitor the formation of healthy habits involving physical activity, specifically walking regularly. ABM's mobile EEG sensing systems will be used to assess dementia biomarkers pre- and post-robot intervention and during initial and final human-robot interactions, providing real-time metrics including engagement, workload, stress, and other measures of interactions between human and robot.  The SAR is envisioned as a complementary approach that will support and enhance any combination of therapeutic interventions for dementia. The team envisions multi-stage user-robot interactions aimed at: increasing physical activity; enhancing cognitive skills; providing motivation; increasing well-being and improving quality of life. The Phase I focus is on increasing physical activity using the robot as a coach for a small cohort (10 healthy elderly; 10 MCI patients) selected from the ongoing ABM dementia biomarker study. Physical exercise is selected based on the specific evidence that increased activity can delay or slow cognitive decline. The Mabu robot will interact with participants twice daily in their homes for 6-weeks to encourage them to be more active. Project Narrative  This project addresses the worldwide demand for novel intervention approaches to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias introducing a novel, socially assistive robot (SAR) protocol designed with the goal of slowing the progression of cognitive decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment. The SAR is envisioned as a complementary approach that will support and enhance any combination of therapeutic interventions for dementia. If successful, the SAR intervention in combination with Advanced Brain Monitoring's objective EEG sleep and daytime dementia biomarkers has the potential to assist patients in living healthier and more productive lives, maintaining independence for longer periods of time, and removing some burden from caregivers.",Interactive Companion Robot for Preventing Neuro-Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's and Other Dementias,9679688,R43AG061994,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Companions', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Gender', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Names', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical Exercise', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Sleep', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Psychology', 'Stress', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive skill', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'design', 'early detection biomarkers', 'human subject', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'social', 'success', 'therapy design', 'usability']",NIA,"ADVANCED BRAIN MONITORING, INC.",R43,2018,410550,-0.07378931477505529
"Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce ABSTRACT The overarching goal of the “Alcoa Study” remains the development of increasingly rich models to explain the disparate health and work-capacity trajectories demonstrated in this universally insured, geographically, socially and economically diverse cohort of 200,000+ men and women as they progress from work-life into retirement. Outcomes of focus remain incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to 1) early life social context via Census data; 2) personal and family work experience and income across the life span via IRS and SSA; 3) post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI) and 4) contextual social environment from lifetime residential geocoding. Consequently, we propose in the next cycle to embrace a life course approach to study the social, environmental and behavioral determinants of the outcomes listed above The specific aims of this grant are: Aim 1: Link Alcoa workers to individual census records to examine how early life environment influences later life health outcomes; Aim 2: Assess the impact on health and function of adverse working environment as it accrues during work-life, with an emphasis on ubiquitous physical hazards; Aim 3: Identify antecedents of short-term and long-term disability across working life as candidates for subsequent hypothesis testing; Aim 4: Assess the impact disability benefits have on employee work function and health; Aim 5: Examine how injuries and health shocks affect retirement savings and subsequent health trajectories; Aim 6: To address generalizability across studies and populations, compare the Alcoa population to relevant complementary datasets, administrative and survey. Viewed altogether, continuation of the Alcoa study with the assembled team of investigators provides an unparalleled opportunity to address a host of critical empiric and methodologic issues previously unapproachable. In addition to understanding better which occupational exposures contribute to chronic disease and disability, these data will allow us to control for economic and other contextual factors to an extraordinary degree. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Alcoa research infrastructure—linking quantitative exposure measures to myriad hazards of active workers whose behavior, social environment and health status from pre-employment through retirement to death are fully observed—provides a unique opportunity to extend our work on the outcomes of focus including incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to early life social context, personal and family work experience and income and post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI).","Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce",9534496,R01AG026291,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Disability Insurance', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Occupational Health', 'Outcome', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Price', 'Privatization', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Shock', 'Social Environment', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Veterans', 'Vietnam', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disability impact', 'experience', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'study population', 'uptake']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,715709,0.020844228383042958
"A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research Summary/Abstract This project will construct a Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (IPUMS-MLP) of unprecedented scale and scope. Using cutting-edge automatic record linkage technology and drawing on complete count U.S. census data available from IPUMS for the period 1850 to 1940, the project will construct millions of individual life histories and trace millions of families over multiple generations. This infrastructure will provide the most comprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will transform our understanding of processes of population aging. The work will require significant innovation and new technical infrastructure to accommodate the massive scale of the database. These data will allow investigators to directly observe changes in aging processes and life-course transitions during the period in which U.S. society was being transformed by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, demographic transition, and economic collapse. Investigators will be able to follow individuals over time to evaluate the impact of early-life conditions on later outcomes, trace life-course transitions into adulthood and old age, and observe family change over multiple generations. IPUMS-MLP will enrich existing aging surveys by providing data on multiple generations of forebears of survey respondents; likewise, it will enrich existing historical databases by enabling them to connect with descendants across multiple generations. Leveraging billions of dollars of federal investments in census data and transactional records from a variety of administrative sources, this project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. Project Narrative The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in health and well-being of the older population and will support research on the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. For example, the data will enable examinations of the impact of lead exposure to late onset Alzheimer’s disease, the socioeconomic and health effects of early-life income support, intergenerational transmission of health and wellbeing over multiple generations, and the impact of early-life cognitive capacity on later-life health and economic outcomes.",A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research,9594032,R01AG057679,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Demographic Transitions', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Genealogy', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immigration', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Mission', 'Names', 'Neighborhoods', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Process', 'Process', 'Public Policy', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Social Processes', 'Social Security', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Urbanization', 'War', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive capacity', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'economic outcome', 'experience', 'health economics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'life history', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,695826,0.0226389177247147
"Real-time prediction of marijuana use & effects of use on cognition in the natural environment ABSTRACT Some young adult marijuana (MJ) users report adverse effects of MJ use on cognition that impact daily functioning, with negative consequences such as injury and fatality due to driving while under the influence of MJ. Research on the effects of MJ use on cognition, however, has produced mixed findings. MJ effects on cognition may depend on factors such as history and current severity of marijuana use, time since last MJ use (including possible MJ withdrawal effects), and gender. This R21 aims to address limitations of existing research by (1) starting to develop an algorithm to predict MJ use using smartphone data in regular/heavy MJ users based on “routine” or “habitual use”, and (2) examining effects of MJ use on cognition using smartphone- based cognitive testing in the natural environment. Development of an algorithm to predict MJ use would facilitate systematic assessment of MJ effects on cognitive functioning through more efficient scheduling of smartphone cognitive testing among regular/heavy MJ users in relation to daily routines. Cognitive testing by smartphone in the natural environment is an innovative method that has shown validity, and permits sampling of cognitive functioning within and across days in relation to MJ use. This project will enroll non-treatment seeking young adult (ages 18-25) MJ users from the community, representing “low”, “regular”, and “heavy” MJ use, with 50% female at each level of use. Participants will complete a baseline lab assessment, 30-day data collection using smartphone and wearable devices (e.g., wristband), and a debriefing interview. Piloting will optimize the protocol and methods for compliance. Smartphones will collect continuously sensed data (e.g., geolocation) for input to an algorithm to predict MJ use in regular/heavy MJ users. This R21 will identify which types of data, available through smartphone, provide optimal detection of routines in MJ use among regular/heavy users. Smartphone cognitive testing will be administered at various times during acute MJ intoxication and various naturalistically occurring lengths of MJ abstinence to examine effects of MJ use on selected aspects of cognitive functioning in daily life. Development of an algorithm to predict MJ use in regular/heavy MJ users based on smartphone data could, for example, facilitate real-time assessment of MJ effects on cognition through improved sampling of cognition in relation to acute and non-acute effects of MJ use. This R21 will provide the foundation for a research program that aims to examine MJ effects on cognitive functioning in vivo, and could support the development of just-in-time intervention to reduce MJ use. This R21 aligns with NIDA's strategic goal of determining consequences of drug use, and cross-cutting themes of highlighting real-world relevance of research and leveraging mobile health technologies to reduce drug use. Project Narrative This exploratory project will initiate development of an algorithm to predict marijuana use using data from smartphone and ecological momentary assessment, and will examine effects of marijuana use on cognitive functioning in the natural environment using innovative smartphone-based cognitive tests. Developing an algorithm to predict marijuana use has substantial healthcare applications, specifically for timely intervention to reduce marijuana use. Further, examining effects of marijuana use on cognitive functioning daily life has important implications for determining possible adverse health consequences associated with marijuana use.",Real-time prediction of marijuana use & effects of use on cognition in the natural environment,9456715,R21DA043181,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Intoxication', 'Length', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'age group', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'computer science', 'daily functioning', 'data mining', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'male', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana use disorder', 'marijuana user', 'marijuana withdrawal', 'mobile computing', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'reduce marijuana use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2018,196166,0.012125611039037846
"Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population Project Summary This project will enhance and develop the only source of data that provides core information about work, education, income, and migration for the entire U.S. population. This unique resource allows us to observe today's late-life population when they were young. This allows a prospective view of the impact of early-life environments and socioeconomic status on health and well-being in later life. The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3. Apply new technologies to democratize access to the data through new data access tools and a virtual data  enclave for a restricted version of the data that contains names. This project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years.

"Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis Project Summary: Brain networks linking the cortex to thalamus are critical for cognitive, sensory, and motor functioning. Dysruption of thalamocortical networks has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including psychosis, and mechanisms of clinical phenotypes, especially cognitive impairment. This view is supported by neuroimaging, including a series of studies by the Co-PIs, which consistently find a combination of reduced thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor-thalamic hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While significant progress has been made, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the normal developmental trajectory of thalamocortical networks and onset of connectivity disturbances in psychosis; relationship between cognitive functions supported by thalamocortical circuits and thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers; and clinical utility of imaging thalamocortical networks. The availability of several large-scale cross-sectional datasets containing multi-modal neuroimaging data and extensive phenotypic data on healthy and at-risk individuals has created an unprecedented opportunity to address these critical knowledge gaps. They include the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN: n=656, ages 18-88); Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI- RS: n=932, ages 6-85); Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics dataset (PING: N=1239, ages 3-20); Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC: n=1601, ages 8-21), which includes psychosis spectrum (PS) youth; and the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS: n=397). Building on our prior work in clinical populations and leveraging the considerable resources of these datasets, we propose to chart the development of thalamocortical networks in healthy subjects (Aim 1) and youth with PS symptoms (Aim 2), characterize the associations between thalamocortical biomarkers and cognition (Aim 3), and investigate the clinical utility of thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers at identifying atypical brain development in individual subjects across the psychosis continuum and predicting conversion to psychosis in clinical high risk individuals (Aim 4). The proposed Aims will: 1) establish critical normative lifespan development data for refining and testing etiological models of not just psychosis, but other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as aging- related disorders; 2) inform the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders and contribute to dimensional models of psychosis; 3) help define the neural basis of executive cognitive abilities thereby providing the necessary foundation for mechanistic models of normal cognitive function and cognitive impairment in psychosis; and 4) potentially provide risk biomarkers and intervention targets for youth at risk for developing a psychotic disorder. Public Health Relevance: Many psychiatric disorders emerge between childhood and early adulthood, a period when the brain is undergoing significant developmental changes, and are associated with cognitive impairment which leads to lifelong limitations in psychosocial functioning. Determining how and when premorbid brain development goes awry, clarifying the neural basis of cognitive impairment, and establishing the clinical utility of brain-based biomarkers at predicting illness onset in individuals at high risk for neuropsychiatric illness are essential to developing targeted interventions that prevent the onset of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.",Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis,9593608,R01MH115000,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age effect', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'symptomatology', 'young adult']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,447624,-0.015518820825008753
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9484214,K01AG051348,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'analytical tool', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'imaging study', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2018,131400,-0.009411461671570167
"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives. Both contributions promise to transform the research frontier in population health and aging in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by adding cause-of-death information to a new intergenerational and longitudinal dataset (LIFE-M). These data will allow much more research on the long- term determinants of health and aging, including a deeper understanding the intergenerational and early-life origins of later-life diseases and mortality in today's aging population.",Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality,9423915,R01AG057704,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Complement', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Certificates', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hand', 'Handwriting', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Resources', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immigrant', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infant', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maiden Name', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Michigan', 'Minnesota', 'Minority Groups', 'Names', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Price', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Science', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Toxin', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'early-life nutrition', 'ethnic minority population', 'frontier', 'health knowledge', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'longitudinal dataset', 'mortality', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'population health', 'population survey', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'suicide rate']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,325845,0.02108573503001349
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9514218,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,182298,0.032208616402735424
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,9483579,R00AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Screening', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R00,2018,249000,0.011731272123350126
"Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders Project Summary: Early life psychosocial adversity and stress are well-established as the most powerful environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes in children. Impairments in developing emotion regulation and cognitive control and associated alterations in brain development have been shown to mediate the effects of adversity on risk for the development of psychopathology. Early psychosocial adversity impacts the epigenetic and inflammation-mediated processes that contribute to these negative outcomes, a process known as “biological embedding of stress.” While this risk trajectory has been clearly linked to increased rates of psychopathology, the mechanisms of this process, its targetable mediators and how early in development they operate are yet to be determined. Here we focus on the effects of early life adversity on brain, emotion regulation and cognitive control outcomes relevant to risk for mental disorders, beginning antenatally and extending to age 3. We will examine the role of pre- and postnatal adversity/stress, the maternal and child perinatal gut microbiome and early caregiver support on these key neurodevelopmental outcomes utilizing state-of-the-art neuroimaging. Our unifying hypothesis is that these factors modulate systemic inflammatory responses, induce neuronal effects through this and other processes that adversely impact brain development in limbic and cortical regions, and mediate the effects of early adversity on child emotion regulation, cognitive control and mental health outcomes. These factors will be studied in a unique, prospectively ascertained cohort of 370 mothers and their offspring at high psychosocial risk being recruited as part of an already funded March of Dimes project at Washington University. The cohort will include both term- and prematurely-born infants and toddlers given the increased risk of psychosocial adversity and aberrant gut microbiome in preterm children. The offspring will be intensively prospectively studied from the 1st trimester to age 3, providing a unique dataset in which to examine the interrelationships among pre- and postnatal adversity, biomarkers of inflammation, the gut microbiome and developmental and mental health outcomes. The perinatal and early childhood periods are critical times to study these exposures as adverse neurodevelopment associated with adversity begins in utero through fetal programming. Likewise, the perinatal period is a critical developmental window for microbial influences, when gut microbial colonization has its most enduring effects. The proposed study merges established research groups in these areas in a center with advanced infant and childhood neuroimaging and extensive microbiome expertise, and offers an unprecedented opportunity to understand the mechanisms of the biological embedding of adversity on brain, cognitive and emotional trajectories in a high-risk cohort. We will also apply innovative computational methods, using Deep Learning, to extend understanding of these data. Findings will provide critical and novel insights to inform early preventive interventions relevant to emotional, cognitive and mental health outcomes for children at greatest risk. Project Narrative This study will investigate the mechanisms by which psychosocial adversity experienced in utero and early in life impact the child’s brain, cognitive and emotional development, testing the hypothesis that stress and adversity during pregnancy adversely affect early brain development through inflammatory mechanisms. Another important focus of this project is to examine how the maternal perinatal microbiome and infant’s gut microbiome during early childhood impact brain development, either through the infant’s inflammatory response or other effects. A third focus is to explore the effects of caregiver support on this risk trajectory, testing the idea that high caregiver support reduces the negative influences of early adversity, altered immune biomarkers and disruptions in the gut microbiome.","Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders",9518320,R01MH113883,"['3 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caregiver support', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Funding', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informal Social Control', 'Instruction', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mothers', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Poverty', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'antenatal', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'gray matter', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiome', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal period', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,1996238,-0.005704441230057973
"A Direct Reading Video Assessment Instrument for Repetitive Motion Stress Project Summary/ Abstract This research studies if computer vision can more effectively evaluate worker exposure and assess the associated risk for work related injuries than conventional methods. Current methods involve either observations or measurements using instruments attached to a worker's hands or arms. Observation is often considered too subjective or inaccurate, and instruments too invasive or time consuming for routine applications in industry. Automated job analysis potentially offers a more objective, accurate, repeatable, and efficient exposure assessment tool than observational analysis. Computer vision uses less resources than instruments attached to workers and does not interfere with production; can quantify more exposure variables and interactions; is suitable for long-term, direct reading exposure assessment; and offers animated data visualizations synchronized with video for identifying aspects of jobs needing interventions. This research leverages the research from coordinated multi-institutional prospective studies of upper limb work related MSD conducted between 2001 and 2010 that studied production and service workers from a variety of US industries, and used rigorous case-criteria and individual-level exposure assessments prospectively, including recording detailed videos of the work. Our study partners from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Washington State Labor & Industries Safety & Health Assessment & Research for Prevention program and the University of California-San Francisco will provide task-level videos, associated exposure variable data, and prospective health outcomes for 1,649 workers. Exposure properties directly measured from videos of jobs and corresponding health outcomes from the prospective study database will establish dose-response relationships to translate into a prototype automated job analysis instrument. We build on our previous success in developing video marker-less hand motion algorithms for estimating the ACGIH hand activity level, and reliable video processing methods for hand tracking under challenging viewing conditions. This proposal will refine and develop additional video algorithms, and analyze the videos to extract exposure measures for repetition, posture, exertions, and their interactions. The video extracted exposure measures will be compared against conventional observational exposure measures made by our collaborators. Video and corresponding observational data will be merged with the prospective health outcomes data to evaluate dose-response and to develop and validate parsimonious exposure risk models for an automated direct reading repetitive motion instrument. We will test if automation has better predictive capability than observation and also consider the accuracy and utility of computer vision analysis against conventional job analysis for selected industrial jobs. This proposal addresses the NIOSH cross-sector programs in Musculoskeletal Disorders as well as in Exposure Assessment. This translational research is in concurrence with the Research to Practice (r2P) initiative by developing technology to disseminate knowledge from recent NIOSH sponsored prospective studies on MSDs.

"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions. Our proposed work will be significant as it will provide epidemiologists with a novel and robust tool to assess exposure to environmental pollutant mixtures. Project Narrative We are constantly exposed to a mixture of environmental pollutants at once, but current epidemiologic methods either assess each pollutant separately, not capturing reality, or have severe limitations.

"Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment SUMMARY Detecting the first and earliest stages of cognitive decline, conceptualized as “mild cognitive impairment” (MCI), has become increasingly important in recent years, as research focuses on delaying the manifestations of more severe stages of decline. It is now well recognized that changes in performance on cognitive tests begin up to ten years (or longer) before clinically apparent symptoms of dementia or functional impairment appear. Conventional assessment methods for assessing cognition Conventional assessment methods typically use the spoken response modality in which subjects are asked to verbally respond to prompts, and examiners carefully listen to these responses and apply test manuals to compute scores. These assessment methods require trained specialists and can be burdensome because they need to performed in clinics, especially so with frequent reassessment. Automating the scoring of assessment is important, not only for alleviating this burden but also for enabling large-scale studies on new intervention methods. Our research goal is to automate detection of MCI by developing, applying, and evaluating a system for automation of verbal (i.e., using spoken responses) cognitive-test scoring. Focusing on four verbal cognitive tests, we develop an extensible system comprising ASR and machine-learning algorithms to automatically score responses, and measure the efficacy of our proposed method by validating the accuracy of the automatically obtained scores against gold-standard, clinically obtained scores (Aim 1). Next, we develop classification methods for detecting individuals with MCI based on all information available in the verbal responses, and validating this classification against gold-standard clinical consensus. NARRATIVE Early detection of mild cognitive disease (MCI) is significantly important to delay more severe stages of cognitive decline. Conventional assessment methods require trained specialists and can be financially beyond the reach of most. We propose a tool for automatically scoring verbal cognitive tests. The proposed tool can be embedded in electronic devices providing the opportunity to assess large number of people in their homes, enabling clinicians to focus on those who are most at risk of cognitive decline.",Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment,9297093,R21AG055749,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Automation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Vascular Cognitive Impairment', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'response', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,184739,0.009050090825305897

"A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health,9313526,K99ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K99,2017,96716,0.017800453913186128
"Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease Project Summary To interact, communicate, and navigate the world successfully, people must retrieve relevant information from their semantic memory (memory for facts and general knowledge). Individuals with Alzheimer's disease have difficulty retrieving such knowledge from early in the course of the disease and progressively gets worse as the disease spreads, a process known as semantic decline. This project examines the mechanisms underlying semantic decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational tools. The extent to which semantic memory is impaired in individuals with Alzheimer's disease can be probed using behavioral experiments. Individuals with Alzheimer's as well as those at-risk for the disease display a pattern of behavior on these tasks distinct from healthy individuals. Despite decades of research, explanations of these behavioral impairments focus almost exclusively on cognitive mechanisms that may explain a patient's current behavior at a given time point, but without an account of the transition from normal, pre-symptomatic behavior to fully impaired behavior. Existing models fail to explain the mechanisms by which semantic memory and memory retrieval processes degrade over time due to Alzheimer's, limiting our understanding of the development of the disease, as well as hindering our ability for prognosis, early detection measures, and possible interventions. This project will test computational models of how the disease spreads, making specific quantitative predictions about the decline of semantic memory. Additionally, we will develop a novel machine learning method that can be used to map the structure of an individual's semantic memory, creating opportunities for individualized behavioral interventions to improve semantic memory and improve the quality of life for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Project Narrative This project examines the mechanisms underlying decline of semantic memory (memory for knowledge) in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational models. This research will develop methods for testing neurocognitive theories of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, inform interventions for mitigating decline, and further our understanding of how the disease spreads.",Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease,9334048,R21AG053467,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Free Association', 'Huntington Disease', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Work', 'behavioral impairment', 'computerized tools', 'contagion', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'memory retrieval', 'neurocognitive test', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2017,193393,-0.06492809706657048
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. The proposed program will apply a novel dental biomarker of exposure to multiple chemicals and cutting-edge statistical methods to identify specific life stages including perinatal periods that correspond to increased susceptibility to neurodevelopmental effects of metal toxicant mixtures.",Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture,9338255,R01ES026033,"['8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Arsenic', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cadmium', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Nutrient', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deciduous tooth', 'developmental neurotoxicity', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,648832,0.05230906149547909
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9212418,R01ES027747,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cadmium', 'Carbon', 'Carbon Black', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Membrane', 'Mercury', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Nitrates', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'RNA marker', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Trace Elements', 'Translations', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vesicle', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'ambient air pollution', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'extracellular vesicles', 'follow-up', 'inflammatory marker', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'modifiable risk', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'toxic metal']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2017,792334,0.01493177327539365
"Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging PROJECT SUMMARY Progressive aging-related cognitive declines are associated with limitations in self-care and functional independence, deteriorating physical health, and impending dementia and mortality, even among the otherwise healthy. Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie cognitive aging is key to developing interventions to prevent or ameliorate cognitive decline. Disconnection theories of aging specifically implicate weakening of structural brain connectivity as a key mechanism of cognitive decline, but until recently, diffusion MRI data and connectomic methods needed to rigorously test such theories have been lacking. To expedite understanding how aging-related changes in the human structural connectome relate to aging-related cognitive declines, we will apply the latest connectomic and multivariate data analysis methods to existing data from two highly unique datasets: (1) The UK Biobank, a cross-sectional sample of ~10,000 40-75 year old adults, who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information; and (2) The Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936, a narrow-age cohort of older adults (baseline age = 73 years; N = 731) who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information on each of three separate occasions, each separated by three years. Using recently developed graph-theoretic models, we will construct structural brain connectome networks for each participant's diffusion MRI data at each wave and extract indices reflective of network topology within several specific networks of interest (NOIs) identified ex ante. We will also identify topologically central hub regions that disproportionately govern efficiency within each individual's connectome network. We will apply cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models to examine aging-related transformations in network indices, examine concurrent and longitudinal coupling between network indices and cognitive abilities, and test predictors of levels and changes in network indices and cognitive abilities. This will allow us to contrast the predictive utility of the selected NOIs for cognitive aging and to identify specific features of network architecture involved in cognitive aging and mediate the effects of demographic, medical, and lifestyle risk factors for cognitive aging. We additionally implement machine- learning methods to estimate an upper bound of prediction of cognitive aging from network indices, and identify novel features of network topology as candidate mechanisms of cognitive decline. The availability of two uniquely large and well-characterized datasets will allow us to ensure that findings are rigorous and reproducible using within sample (holdout) and between sample cross-validation. For all aims, we will place considerable emphasis on testing for incremental validity of network indices relative to both conventional structural neuroanatomical measures and topologically naïve summary indices of network integrity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie aging-related cognitive declines is key to developing interventions to improve both health and quality of life. This project will examine how changes in the structural connections between brain regions relate to changes in cognitive abilities over time and test hypothesized health, sociodemographic, and genetic predictors of such changes.",Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging,9385440,R01AG054628,"['3 year old', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Genetic', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Self Care', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'aged', 'biobank', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'genetic predictors', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mortality', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'social', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2017,502543,0.024992028332895117
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychopathology arising from a disruption of emotional function affects over 400 million people globally, yet we lack a neurobiological model to guide classification and treatment.

"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework,9381203,K99ES027511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'African American', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Future', 'GALA', 'Genetic', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune System and Related Disorders', 'Immune system', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Puerto Rican', 'Randomized', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'analog', 'base', 'career', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'exposure pathway', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'minority children', 'pollutant', 'public health intervention', 'pulmonary function', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social disparities', 'tool']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2017,94114,-0.0200289904069434
"Understanding the impact of environmental disruption in biological timing systems through signal processing. Project Summary/Abstract.  Life on Earth evolved to take time cues from the Sun. Consequently, most or all cells in the mammalian body use genetic feedback loops to time their daily (circadian) rhythms. When a person or any mammal sees light, that winds an orchestrating circadian brain clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN in turn helps keep the myriad other tissue and endocrine rhythms in synchrony, enabling health. The modern environment is highly disruptive to this internal synchrony. Light at night from cell phones or urban light pollution, and social impositions like school start times or rotating work shifts all act as “temporal pollution,” causing loss of internal synchrony. The more severe the desynchrony, the higher the risk for a broad range of diseases, including obesity, cancer, infertility, depression and ultimately cognitive decline. Without knowing how these systems normally maintain synchrony or which systems are normally synchronized, it is hard to understand what happens in desynchrony to degrade health. This problem is complicated by the fact that some biological systems have ultradian (every few hours) and infradian (every few days) cycles in addition to circadian cycles. The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) generates ultradian rhythms through negative feedback, but also shows a strong circadian cycle; the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG) shows the same negative feedback ultradian activity, circadian rhythmicity, and also infradian rhythms of ovulation and spermatogenesis. These two axes are regulated by the SCN. Recent work indicates that there is cross-talk between these axes, and that their hormonal outputs - corticosterone, and estradiol (in females) and testosterone (in males), respectively – work to synchronize extra-SCN tissues and behavioral rhythms of feeding and drinking (FaD). Finally, the SCN, HPA, and HPG axes all affect core body temperature (CBT), so that high temporal resolution recordings of CBT contain information about the cycling and synchrony of these systems across time scales.  There are three aims to this proposal, using rats as a model system: 1) Test at high temporal resolution the effects of changes to the HPA axis, HPG axis, and SCN on CBT. 2) Use these relationships to build a model that can back-predict the state of the HPA axis, HPG axis, and SCN from a high temporal resolution CBT record of a given individual. 3) Expose rats to environmental temporal disruption in the form of a 6 h “jetlag” phase advance of the light cycle, and use the model to predict the response across these systems at 1-minute temporal resolution. This work will employ within-animal comparisons before and after surgical and pharmacological manipulations of rats whose FaD, activity, and CBT are captured continuously at 1-minute resolution. These data will be analyzed using signal-processing and machine learning to define patterns and relationships. The resulting model will allow minimally-invasive exploration of environmental disruption across physiological systems in real time. The model will be used to quantify synchrony as it is disrupted and re-emerges, identifying markers for risk or resilience, and generating hypotheses for future work into preventive strategies and treatments. Project Narrative. Artificial lights and social obligation cause people living with modern infrastructure to suffer a loss of synchrony across their organs, which evolved to track the stable day and year light cycles. We know about internal synchrony mostly by the diseases that arise from its loss – everything from cancer to obesity, depression, and infertility. This work will develop a system for tracking the cycles of many body-systems at the same time with minute-to-minute accuracy, allowing rapid detection of desynchrony, and a potential way to study how synchrony works normally, and why its disruption by the modern environment causes disease.",Understanding the impact of environmental disruption in biological timing systems through signal processing.,9386306,K99ES027509,"['Address', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Body Temperature', 'Body Temperature Changes', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Corticosterone', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dysmenorrhea', 'Dyspepsia', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine system', 'Environment', 'Environmental Impact', 'Estradiol', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormonal Change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Jet Lag Syndrome', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Orphan', 'Output', 'Ovulation', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System', 'Planet Earth', 'Pollution', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Rattus', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Obligations', 'Spermatogenesis', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'body system', 'comparative', 'drinking', 'feeding', 'high risk', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'minimally invasive', 'pituitary gonadal axis', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'rapid detection', 'reconstruction', 'resilience', 'response', 'shift work', 'signal processing', 'social', 'suprachiasmatic nucleus', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'time use']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2017,98712,-0.033890754340619805
"Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce ABSTRACT The overarching goal of the “Alcoa Study” remains the development of increasingly rich models to explain the disparate health and work-capacity trajectories demonstrated in this universally insured, geographically, socially and economically diverse cohort of 200,000+ men and women as they progress from work-life into retirement. Outcomes of focus remain incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to 1) early life social context via Census data; 2) personal and family work experience and income across the life span via IRS and SSA; 3) post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI) and 4) contextual social environment from lifetime residential geocoding. Consequently, we propose in the next cycle to embrace a life course approach to study the social, environmental and behavioral determinants of the outcomes listed above The specific aims of this grant are: Aim 1: Link Alcoa workers to individual census records to examine how early life environment influences later life health outcomes; Aim 2: Assess the impact on health and function of adverse working environment as it accrues during work-life, with an emphasis on ubiquitous physical hazards; Aim 3: Identify antecedents of short-term and long-term disability across working life as candidates for subsequent hypothesis testing; Aim 4: Assess the impact disability benefits have on employee work function and health; Aim 5: Examine how injuries and health shocks affect retirement savings and subsequent health trajectories; Aim 6: To address generalizability across studies and populations, compare the Alcoa population to relevant complementary datasets, administrative and survey. Viewed altogether, continuation of the Alcoa study with the assembled team of investigators provides an unparalleled opportunity to address a host of critical empiric and methodologic issues previously unapproachable. In addition to understanding better which occupational exposures contribute to chronic disease and disability, these data will allow us to control for economic and other contextual factors to an extraordinary degree. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Alcoa research infrastructure—linking quantitative exposure measures to myriad hazards of active workers whose behavior, social environment and health status from pre-employment through retirement to death are fully observed—provides a unique opportunity to extend our work on the outcomes of focus including incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to early life social context, personal and family work experience and income and post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI).","Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce",9310192,R01AG026291,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Disability Insurance', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Occupational Health', 'Outcome', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Price', 'Privatization', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Shock', 'Social Environment', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Veterans', 'Vietnam', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disability impact', 'experience', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'study population', 'uptake']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,757494,0.020844228383042958
"Real-time prediction of marijuana use & effects of use on cognition in the natural environment ABSTRACT Some young adult marijuana (MJ) users report adverse effects of MJ use on cognition that impact daily functioning, with negative consequences such as injury and fatality due to driving while under the influence of MJ. Research on the effects of MJ use on cognition, however, has produced mixed findings. MJ effects on cognition may depend on factors such as history and current severity of marijuana use, time since last MJ use (including possible MJ withdrawal effects), and gender. This R21 aims to address limitations of existing research by (1) starting to develop an algorithm to predict MJ use using smartphone data in regular/heavy MJ users based on “routine” or “habitual use”, and (2) examining effects of MJ use on cognition using smartphone- based cognitive testing in the natural environment. Development of an algorithm to predict MJ use would facilitate systematic assessment of MJ effects on cognitive functioning through more efficient scheduling of smartphone cognitive testing among regular/heavy MJ users in relation to daily routines. Cognitive testing by smartphone in the natural environment is an innovative method that has shown validity, and permits sampling of cognitive functioning within and across days in relation to MJ use. This project will enroll non-treatment seeking young adult (ages 18-25) MJ users from the community, representing “low”, “regular”, and “heavy” MJ use, with 50% female at each level of use. Participants will complete a baseline lab assessment, 30-day data collection using smartphone and wearable devices (e.g., wristband), and a debriefing interview. Piloting will optimize the protocol and methods for compliance. Smartphones will collect continuously sensed data (e.g., geolocation) for input to an algorithm to predict MJ use in regular/heavy MJ users. This R21 will identify which types of data, available through smartphone, provide optimal detection of routines in MJ use among regular/heavy users. Smartphone cognitive testing will be administered at various times during acute MJ intoxication and various naturalistically occurring lengths of MJ abstinence to examine effects of MJ use on selected aspects of cognitive functioning in daily life. Development of an algorithm to predict MJ use in regular/heavy MJ users based on smartphone data could, for example, facilitate real-time assessment of MJ effects on cognition through improved sampling of cognition in relation to acute and non-acute effects of MJ use. This R21 will provide the foundation for a research program that aims to examine MJ effects on cognitive functioning in vivo, and could support the development of just-in-time intervention to reduce MJ use. This R21 aligns with NIDA's strategic goal of determining consequences of drug use, and cross-cutting themes of highlighting real-world relevance of research and leveraging mobile health technologies to reduce drug use. Project Narrative This exploratory project will initiate development of an algorithm to predict marijuana use using data from smartphone and ecological momentary assessment, and will examine effects of marijuana use on cognitive functioning in the natural environment using innovative smartphone-based cognitive tests. Developing an algorithm to predict marijuana use has substantial healthcare applications, specifically for timely intervention to reduce marijuana use. Further, examining effects of marijuana use on cognitive functioning daily life has important implications for determining possible adverse health consequences associated with marijuana use.",Real-time prediction of marijuana use & effects of use on cognition in the natural environment,9329948,R21DA043181,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drug usage', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Intoxication', 'Length', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'age group', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'computer science', 'daily functioning', 'data mining', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'male', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana use disorder', 'marijuana user', 'marijuana withdrawal', 'mobile computing', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'reduce marijuana use', 'young adult']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2017,234230,0.012125611039037846
"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows Abstract: Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking. Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (PI) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals. By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 proposal builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study. Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities. Narrative: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking. Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This proposal will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",9189610,R00ES022986,"['13 year old', '4 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Burden', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'analytical tool', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deciduous tooth', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'forest', 'innovation', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'public health priorities', 'skills', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R00,2017,248999,0.07423845727529133
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9278065,K01AG051348,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'analytical tool', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'imaging study', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2017,131400,-0.009411461671570167
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9354508,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,201353,0.032208616402735424
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,9303234,R00AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R00,2017,249000,0.011731272123350126
"Center for Environmental Genetics This application requests a 5-year renewal of the Center for Environmental Genetics. The unified theme of  the proposal is to elucidate how gene and environment interaction through epigenetics influences disease  risks and health outcome. Ohioans are exposed to exceptionally bad air quality due to dated power plants  and the fact that it is situated in the nation's main artery of the north-south transportation route. These unique  geographical/economic features put the residents in the state at high risk of the following diseases: (a)  endocrine disruption and cancer; (b) immune and allergic diseases; (c) cardiovascular and lipid disorders;  and (d) neurology and behavior disorders. The CEG has 20-years' of accumulative success in environmental  health sciences (EHS) research, our aspiration is to help mitigate these environmental diseases, first in Ohio,  then extend our success to similar populations in the nation and around the globe. Here we propose to attain  our goal by (1) expanding EHS research human capital through the continued recruitment and support of  investigators of all levels to EHS research, (2) innovative ideas and collaborative work from new and  established investigators will be supported by the Pilot Project Program and Director's Fund, (3) junior  investigators will be mentored by a Career Development Program and strong mentor-mentee relationships;  (4) an Integrative Technology Support Core combined with a Bioinformatics Core will provide investigators  with leading-edge technologies and data analysis to attain a new level of system-biology approach to EHS;  (5) enhancement activities such as workshops, symposia and seminar series will be used to stimulate  collaboration and innovation; (6) an Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core will provide the toolbox for  translation of EHS to the clinical and human studies; and (7) a Community Outreach and Engagement Core  will serve to translate EHS to public health and health education for healthier living and disease prevention.

"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.

"A Direct Reading Video Assessment Instrument for Repetitive Motion Stress Project Summary/ Abstract This research studies if computer vision can more effectively evaluate worker exposure and assess the associated risk for work related injuries than conventional methods. Current methods involve either observations or measurements using instruments attached to a worker's hands or arms. Observation is often considered too subjective or inaccurate, and instruments too invasive or time consuming for routine applications in industry. Automated job analysis potentially offers a more objective, accurate, repeatable, and efficient exposure assessment tool than observational analysis. Computer vision uses less resources than instruments attached to workers and does not interfere with production; can quantify more exposure variables and interactions; is suitable for long-term, direct reading exposure assessment; and offers animated data visualizations synchronized with video for identifying aspects of jobs needing interventions. This research leverages the research from coordinated multi-institutional prospective studies of upper limb work related MSD conducted between 2001 and 2010 that studied production and service workers from a variety of US industries, and used rigorous case-criteria and individual-level exposure assessments prospectively, including recording detailed videos of the work. Our study partners from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Washington State Labor & Industries Safety & Health Assessment & Research for Prevention program and the University of California-San Francisco will provide task-level videos, associated exposure variable data, and prospective health outcomes for 1,649 workers. Exposure properties directly measured from videos of jobs and corresponding health outcomes from the prospective study database will establish dose-response relationships to translate into a prototype automated job analysis instrument. We build on our previous success in developing video marker-less hand motion algorithms for estimating the ACGIH hand activity level, and reliable video processing methods for hand tracking under challenging viewing conditions. This proposal will refine and develop additional video algorithms, and analyze the videos to extract exposure measures for repetition, posture, exertions, and their interactions. The video extracted exposure measures will be compared against conventional observational exposure measures made by our collaborators. Video and corresponding observational data will be merged with the prospective health outcomes data to evaluate dose-response and to develop and validate parsimonious exposure risk models for an automated direct reading repetitive motion instrument. We will test if automation has better predictive capability than observation and also consider the accuracy and utility of computer vision analysis against conventional job analysis for selected industrial jobs. This proposal addresses the NIOSH cross-sector programs in Musculoskeletal Disorders as well as in Exposure Assessment. This translational research is in concurrence with the Research to Practice (r2P) initiative by developing technology to disseminate knowledge from recent NIOSH sponsored prospective studies on MSDs.

"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials.

"Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management Project Summary/Abstract Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation and our partners propose to develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) system for persons with dementia (PWD),(mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, or other dementias), who are living in assisted living facilities. The proposed system uses Augmented Intelligence (AI) to communicate with the PWD in natural language. The system's goals are three-fold. First, the system helps PWD transition from living in their homes to ALFs by fostering relationships and conveying schedules. Second, the system enables PWD to age in place by addressing the challenges that often lead to an escalation of care (i.e., nursing homes). Third, the system engages PWD via activities such as storytelling and simple games. We will integrate the proposed SAR system with current assistive technology, which is based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and quality of life in PWD. A strong multi-disciplinary team of engineers, academic experts in SAR and PWD, and a commercialization partner has been assembled to achieve these goals. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases affecting an estimated 5.3 million Americans at a cost of $236 billion. Social assistive robots can be used to lessen levels of depression, loneliness, grief, fear, and frustration as dementia progresses improving mental health and quality of life. In addition to improved quality of life, persons with dementia may be able to extend the amount of time in assisted living before being forced to a much costlier higher level of care such as a nursing home.",Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management,9466569,R44AG058337,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fostering', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Health', 'Hobbies', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information and Media', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Loneliness', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'body language', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'robot interface', 'social', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2017,349861,-0.02548032135850294
"Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease Project Summary To interact, communicate, and navigate the world successfully, people must retrieve relevant information from their semantic memory (memory for facts and general knowledge). Individuals with Alzheimer's disease have difficulty retrieving such knowledge from early in the course of the disease and progressively gets worse as the disease spreads, a process known as semantic decline. This project examines the mechanisms underlying semantic decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational tools. The extent to which semantic memory is impaired in individuals with Alzheimer's disease can be probed using behavioral experiments. Individuals with Alzheimer's as well as those at-risk for the disease display a pattern of behavior on these tasks distinct from healthy individuals. Despite decades of research, explanations of these behavioral impairments focus almost exclusively on cognitive mechanisms that may explain a patient's current behavior at a given time point, but without an account of the transition from normal, pre-symptomatic behavior to fully impaired behavior. Existing models fail to explain the mechanisms by which semantic memory and memory retrieval processes degrade over time due to Alzheimer's, limiting our understanding of the development of the disease, as well as hindering our ability for prognosis, early detection measures, and possible interventions. This project will test computational models of how the disease spreads, making specific quantitative predictions about the decline of semantic memory. Additionally, we will develop a novel machine learning method that can be used to map the structure of an individual's semantic memory, creating opportunities for individualized behavioral interventions to improve semantic memory and improve the quality of life for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Project Narrative This project examines the mechanisms underlying decline of semantic memory (memory for knowledge) in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational models. This research will develop methods for testing neurocognitive theories of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, inform interventions for mitigating decline, and further our understanding of how the disease spreads.",Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease,9164777,R21AG053467,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Free Association', 'Huntington Disease', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Work', 'behavioral impairment', 'computerized tools', 'contagion', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'memory retrieval', 'neurocognitive test', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'research study', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2016,206644,-0.06492809706657048
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health.

"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,9124954,R01NS086885,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Afghanistan', 'Amnesia', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iraq', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sports', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'concussive symptom', 'executive function', 'gray matter', 'inattention', 'interest', 'meetings', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood symptom', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'persistent symptom', 'response', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,347813,0.04156488978333522
"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Where people spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. Previous studies have only looked at places near to home. This project will assess behaviors in different locations across the day and relate exposure to different environments to biological outcomes such as insulin resistance.",(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk,9132699,R01CA179977,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'Calories', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Code', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'High Fat Diet', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Income', 'Inflammation', 'Information Systems', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recreation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Self Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'base', 'built environment', 'cancer risk', 'collaborative environment', 'demographics', 'density', 'fast food', 'food environment', 'good diet', 'inflammatory marker', 'land use', 'learned behavior', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'obesogenic', 'physical inactivity', 'residence', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sugar', 'tv watching', 'walkability']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,816993,0.01363248837811226
"Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce ABSTRACT The overarching goal of the “Alcoa Study” remains the development of increasingly rich models to explain the disparate health and work-capacity trajectories demonstrated in this universally insured, geographically, socially and economically diverse cohort of 200,000+ men and women as they progress from work-life into retirement. Outcomes of focus remain incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. Our unique data set has been augmented to include early life social context via Census data; personal and family work experience and income across the life span via IRS and SSA; post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI) and contextual social environment from lifetime residential geocoding. Consequently, we propose in the next cycle to embrace a life course approach to study the social, environmental and behavioral determinants of the outcomes listed above The specific aims of this grant are: Aim 1: Link Alcoa workers to individual census records to examine how early life environment influences later life health outcomes. Aim 2: Assess the impact on health and function of adverse working environment as it accrues during work-life, with an emphasis on ubiquitous physical hazards. Aim 3: Identify antecedents of short-term and long-term disability across working life as candidates for subsequent hypothesis testing. Aim 4: Assess the impact disability benefits have on employee work function and health. Aim 5: Examine how injuries and health shocks affect retirement savings and subsequent health trajectories. Viewed altogether, continuation of the Alcoa study with the assembled team of investigators provides an unparalleled opportunity to address a host of critical empiric and methodologic issues previously unapproachable. In addition to understanding better which occupational exposures contribute to chronic disease and disability, these data will allow us to control for economic and other contextual factors to an extraordinary degree. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Alcoa research infrastructure—linking quantitative exposure measures to myriad hazards of active workers whose behavior, social environment and health status from pre-employment through retirement to death are fully observed—provides a unique opportunity to extend our work on the our outcomes of focus including incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to early life social context, personal and family work experience and income and post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI).","Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce",9345124,R56AG026291,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Disability Insurance', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Conditions', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Occupational Health', 'Outcome', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Price', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Shock', 'Social Environment', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Veterans', 'Vietnam', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disability impact', 'experience', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'uptake']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2016,1154772,0.018566744855900392
"Healthspan Analysis of C. elegans Strains Treated with Candidate Anti Aging Inter DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human aging is associated with physical and cognitive decline as well as a marked increase of susceptibility to cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease. As such, the promotion of healthy aging, with extended resistance to decline, is a major goal of medical research. To address this problem, simple animals models such as the nematode C. elegans have been studied, providing molecular insights into the genes and drug interventions that modulate conserved aging processes. The goal of the proposed work is to participate in a co-operative scientific group that tests drugs for the abilityto extend healthy aging and promote longevity in the C. elegans model. A specific emphasis will be to test promising drugs on a collection of natural variants of C. elegans, which will seek to represent the extensive genetic heterogeneity in the human population-those drugs that confer similar outcomes across a diverse population will be considered to have an increased change of being efficacious in higher organisms. Our first goal is to conduct a fast preliminary evaluation o how diverse species variants age, using two fast assays of aging quality that monitor conserved processes that accompany human aging: 1) analysis of auto fluorescent lipofuscin and advanced glycation end products, which accumulate to high levels in C. elegans reference strain N2 that age poorly but remain at low levels in animals that age gracefully; 2) diminished locomotory capacity, which we evaluate with powerful computer vision analysis programs. We will use this preliminary data to select a test set of strains for our second goal: drug screening across a diverse population from the same species for promotion of longevity and healthspan. Our expertise in developing rapidly assessed healthspan measures should facilitate drug dose selection as well as healthspan evaluation. Overall, the proposed study will definitively shed insight into how natural variation within a species impacts longevity and healthspan. Pharmacological interventions that robustly promote strong healthspan across a varied population target should be identified. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will identify drug interventions that improve the length of life and/or the quality of aging in a simple animal model. Data obtained by testing a genetically diverse test set is anticipated to identify drugs with high potential to be efficaciousin a diverse human population. This study may lead to pharmacological interventions that protect against physical deterioration, cognitive decline, and disease susceptibility in the elderly human population.",Healthspan Analysis of C. elegans Strains Treated with Candidate Anti Aging Inter,9272627,U01AG045864,"['Address', 'Advanced Glycosylation End Products', 'Advisory Committees', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Distant', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lipofuscin', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Metabolic', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nematoda', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogeny', 'Pigments', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Staging', 'Swimming', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti aging', 'drug testing', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'healthy aging', 'impression', 'improved', 'insight', 'male', 'middle age', 'multiple drug use', 'programs', 'sex', 'species difference', 'willingness']",NIA,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",U01,2016,302251,0.0031344785719502953
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9197901,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Proxy', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'trafficking', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2016,199585,0.032208616402735424
"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows Abstract: Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking. Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (PI) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals. By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 proposal builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study. Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities. Narrative: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking. Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This proposal will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",9026614,R00ES022986,"['13 year old', '4 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Burden', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'abstracting', 'analytical tool', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deciduous tooth', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'forest', 'innovation', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'public health priorities', 'skills', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R00,2016,248999,0.07423845727529133
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9145621,K01AG051348,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2016,131400,-0.009411461671570167
"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.

"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,9213710,R00AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tissue fixing', 'tool']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R00,2016,249000,0.011731272123350126
"A Direct Reading Video Assessment Instrument for Repetitive Motion Stress Project Summary/ Abstract This research studies if computer vision can more effectively evaluate worker exposure and assess the associated risk for work related injuries than conventional methods. Current methods involve either observations or measurements using instruments attached to a worker's hands or arms. Observation is often considered too subjective or inaccurate, and instruments too invasive or time consuming for routine applications in industry. Automated job analysis potentially offers a more objective, accurate, repeatable, and efficient exposure assessment tool than observational analysis. Computer vision uses less resources than instruments attached to workers and does not interfere with production; can quantify more exposure variables and interactions; is suitable for long-term, direct reading exposure assessment; and offers animated data visualizations synchronized with video for identifying aspects of jobs needing interventions. This research leverages the research from coordinated multi-institutional prospective studies of upper limb work related MSD conducted between 2001 and 2010 that studied production and service workers from a variety of US industries, and used rigorous case-criteria and individual-level exposure assessments prospectively, including recording detailed videos of the work. Our study partners from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Washington State Labor & Industries Safety & Health Assessment & Research for Prevention program and the University of California-San Francisco will provide task-level videos, associated exposure variable data, and prospective health outcomes for 1,649 workers. Exposure properties directly measured from videos of jobs and corresponding health outcomes from the prospective study database will establish dose-response relationships to translate into a prototype automated job analysis instrument. We build on our previous success in developing video marker-less hand motion algorithms for estimating the ACGIH hand activity level, and reliable video processing methods for hand tracking under challenging viewing conditions. This proposal will refine and develop additional video algorithms, and analyze the videos to extract exposure measures for repetition, posture, exertions, and their interactions. The video extracted exposure measures will be compared against conventional observational exposure measures made by our collaborators. Video and corresponding observational data will be merged with the prospective health outcomes data to evaluate dose-response and to develop and validate parsimonious exposure risk models for an automated direct reading repetitive motion instrument. We will test if automation has better predictive capability than observation and also consider the accuracy and utility of computer vision analysis against conventional job analysis for selected industrial jobs. This proposal addresses the NIOSH cross-sector programs in Musculoskeletal Disorders as well as in Exposure Assessment. This translational research is in concurrence with the Research to Practice (r2P) initiative by developing technology to disseminate knowledge from recent NIOSH sponsored prospective studies on MSDs.

"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials.

"A Strength Analysis Tool for Studying Healthy Aging via Exercise in C. elegans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exercise is arguably the most potent approach we can take to defer physical decline associated with aging and to protect against late onset diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Molecular understanding of how exercise benefits translate into healthy aging is thus of definitive medical interest. We study fundamental processes relevant to healthy aging in the 959-celled nematode C. elegans. Recently we made a fascinating discovery-C. elegans can exercise (swim) to exhibit training benefits, and appear to gain benefits by molecular pathways conserved in humans. Our initial model development opens up a new research area for understanding how tissue-specific and organism-wide health benefits are induced by exercise, and creates a novel paradigm for identifying exercise mimetic drugs that might promote healthy aging. To really harvest the potential of this model, we need to measure the strength of the tiny C. elegans. We collaborated to develop a strength test in which trained animals thread through a matrix of deformable pillars, and the extent of pillar deflection is used to calculate force. Our ""NemaFlex"" force detection device is the quantitative foundation with which we expect to break new ground in understanding exercise impact on healthy aging. Here we propose required development to enhance assay throughput and pursue applications that will not only anchor this technology as an essential component of C. elegans exercise evaluation but also accelerate studies on exercise biology and healthy aging in this powerful model. Aim 1 is to develop a novel high throughput tool for direct strength evaluation in C. elegans.  This aim will generate an essential tool for analysis of C. elegans strength at multiple life stages, define the exercise regimen that will become the anchor protocol in the field, and reveal features of training in this model. Aim 2 is to use NemaFlex to evaluate exercise mimetic drugs & to facilitate focused pilot genetic screens. This aim will establish critical proof-of-principle for genetic and drug discovery using the NemaFlex. Aim 3 is to initiate dissection of the functional and molecular relationship between exercise and healthy aging, grounded in NemaFlex force measures of training benefits.  To begin, we will test how optimized strength training tracks with a broad spectrum of healthspan indicators that decline with age, we will investigate impact of cessation of training on aging quality, and we will ask if exercise mimetic drugs extend healthspan in the absence of training. Our goals will create novel technology that for the first time permits facile quantitativ analysis of exercise adaptations in the powerful C. elegans genetic model. Accomplishment of our tractable aims will anchor a new subfield of genetic investigation of exercise and healthy aging that may influence design of interventions that broadly promote health and defer aging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Exercise has a profound positive impact on health of the aging population in that it protects against age-associated diseases including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, at the same time it maintains muscle, immune system, and nervous system function in aging. We are developing the first exercise model in the simple animal C. elegans, in which training benefits appear mediated by conserved mechanisms and exercise promotes healthy aging. We will optimize a novel tool for direct strength measurement of these tiny 959-celled animals and show how our device can facilitate searches for exercise mimetic drugs and genes that are associated with training adaptations, and can also help define exercise impact on a broad range of healthy aging measures. The experimental advantages of C. elegans may yield unexpected insights that inspire development of novel interventions that protect against age-associated disease and age-associated decline.",A Strength Analysis Tool for Studying Healthy Aging via Exercise in C. elegans,9116734,R21AG050503,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biology of Aging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pump', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Swimming', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'age-related muscle loss', 'aging population', 'anti aging', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'exercise regimen', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'healthy aging', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'mimetics', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'strength training', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIA,TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,184503,0.017436460378038934
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Abstract Cognition in later life deteriorates when age-associated degenerative and other pathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand, counteract or compensate for those processes through neuroplastic, reparative responses. Thus, while clinicopathological correlation studies show significant associations of plaques, tangles, infarctions and other lesions with cognitive impairment, the relationships are imperfect, and it is increasingly recognized that some elderly persons may have abundant pathology and yet still are unimpaired. We propose an innovative clinicopathological approach in the richly characterized Religious Orders Study (ROS) cohort to identify candidate proteins and pathways that best confer cognitive resilience despite the presence of neurodegenerative disease pathologies. To accomplish this we apply non-biased stratification in the ROS cohort to identify three distinct test groups of 60 each: 1) AD-Dementia (dementia with abundant plaque and tangle pathology), 2) AD-Resilient (normal cognition despite abundant AD plaque. tangle and other pathology), and 3) Healthy (normal cognition and minimal AD or other pathology). We will measure the expression of >500 proteins that span functional families of apoptosis, synaptic neurotransmission and neuroplasticity, metabolic, inflammatory, cytoskeletal, signal transduction pathways and others. We will test two hypotheses that pro-apoptotic proteins and synaptic plasticity proteins differentiate the clinicopathological category groups and we will conduct machine learning approaches to further identify these and novel analytes that best predict categories. Based on these analyses, we will generate a targeted multi-analyte immunoassay panel. This will be used to validate the association of candidate proteins with cognitive resilience in another set of 480 ROS cases. Our focus on the neurobiology of resilient brain aging will be an important counterpoint and complement to historical and current efforts focused on the neurobiology of disease pathology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Cognitive decline in aging arises when age-associated neuropathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand or adapt to those processes. We propose an innovative clinicopathological approach to identify candidate proteins and pathways that best confer cognitive resilience despite the presence of neurodegenerative disease pathologies. Using antibody microarrays for discovery and multi-analyte immunoassays for validation in brain tissues from participants of the Religious Orders Study, we will identify potential novel mechanisms of cognitive resilience in aging.",Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging,8828052,R01AG039478,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antibodies', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Case Study', 'Categories', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Family', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Immunoassay', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Inflammatory', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protein Microchips', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Relative (related person)', 'Religion and Spirituality', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sex Education', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Stratification', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'aging brain', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuron loss', 'neuropathology', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'pro-apoptotic protein', 'regenerative', 'relational database', 'resilience', 'response', 'synaptogenesis', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2015,256386,-0.05801806555509917
"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources.

"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows Abstract: Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking. Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (PI) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals. By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 proposal builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study. Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities. Narrative: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking. Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This proposal will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",8992934,R00ES022986,"['13 year old', '4 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Burden', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'abstracting', 'analytical tool', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deciduous tooth', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'forest', 'innovation', 'lead exposure', 'longitudinal design', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'public health priorities', 'skills', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R00,2015,248999,0.07423845727529133
"Healthspan Analysis of C. elegans Strains Treated with Candidate Anti Aging Inter DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human aging is associated with physical and cognitive decline as well as a marked increase of susceptibility to cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease. As such, the promotion of healthy aging, with extended resistance to decline, is a major goal of medical research. To address this problem, simple animals models such as the nematode C. elegans have been studied, providing molecular insights into the genes and drug interventions that modulate conserved aging processes. The goal of the proposed work is to participate in a co-operative scientific group that tests drugs for the abilityto extend healthy aging and promote longevity in the C. elegans model. A specific emphasis will be to test promising drugs on a collection of natural variants of C. elegans, which will seek to represent the extensive genetic heterogeneity in the human population-those drugs that confer similar outcomes across a diverse population will be considered to have an increased change of being efficacious in higher organisms. Our first goal is to conduct a fast preliminary evaluation o how diverse species variants age, using two fast assays of aging quality that monitor conserved processes that accompany human aging: 1) analysis of auto fluorescent lipofuscin and advanced glycation end products, which accumulate to high levels in C. elegans reference strain N2 that age poorly but remain at low levels in animals that age gracefully; 2) diminished locomotory capacity, which we evaluate with powerful computer vision analysis programs. We will use this preliminary data to select a test set of strains for our second goal: drug screening across a diverse population from the same species for promotion of longevity and healthspan. Our expertise in developing rapidly assessed healthspan measures should facilitate drug dose selection as well as healthspan evaluation. Overall, the proposed study will definitively shed insight into how natural variation within a species impacts longevity and healthspan. Pharmacological interventions that robustly promote strong healthspan across a varied population target should be identified. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will identify drug interventions that improve the length of life and/or the quality of aging in a simple animal model. Data obtained by testing a genetically diverse test set is anticipated to identify drugs with high potential to be efficaciousin a diverse human population. This study may lead to pharmacological interventions that protect against physical deterioration, cognitive decline, and disease susceptibility in the elderly human population.",Healthspan Analysis of C. elegans Strains Treated with Candidate Anti Aging Inter,8858490,U01AG045864,"['Address', 'Advanced Glycosylation End Products', 'Advisory Committees', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Distant', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lipofuscin', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Metabolic', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nematoda', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogeny', 'Pigments', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Staging', 'Swimming', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti aging', 'drug testing', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'healthy aging', 'impression', 'improved', 'insight', 'male', 'middle age', 'multiple drug use', 'programs', 'sex', 'species difference', 'willingness']",NIA,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",U01,2015,406662,0.0031344785719502953
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.             ",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,8951241,K01AG051348,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2015,131400,-0.009411461671570167
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,8775624,K99AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tissue fixing', 'tool']",NIA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2015,90000,0.011731272123350126
"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,8832593,P30ES006096,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Allergic Disease', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health education', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Nature', 'Neurology', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Power Plants', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'environmental agent', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'health science research', 'high risk', 'human capital', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lipid disorder', 'malignant endocrine gland neoplasm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'symposium']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2015,1735289,0.029234890562166004
"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology. Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8874981,R01ES020819,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Electron Transport', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fumarates', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hypoxia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Staging', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Succinates', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin A Deficiency', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'environmental stressor', 'environmental toxicology', 'extracellular', 'high risk', 'human population study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'nucleotide metabolism', 'organic acid', 'phenyl ether', 'pollutant', 'protein misfolding', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'statistics', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2015,377291,0.026680090447523473
"Microfluidics-Enabled High-Throughput Studies on Early Embryonic Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal alcohol exposure causes a range of developmental disorders that are commonly referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The most severe case of FASDs is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and is characterized by growth deficiencies, craniofacial malformations, and both structural and functional central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. The combination of technological limitations that decrease experimental throughput and the inherent stochasticity of biological processes eliminate the ability to gain a quantitative understanding about the onset and progression of ethanol-related developmental disorders. As a result there is not much known mechanistically about how ethanol exposure manifests as FASDs. Here, we aim to develop a microfluidic-based system that enables high-throughput and high-content studies to elucidate the effects of ethanol exposure on embryogenesis. The model organism Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) has been shown to be a model of FASDs, because Drosophila exhibits similar phenotypical defects as humans when embryos are raised on ethanol solutions. It has yet to be seen how ethanol exposure affects developmental processes that occur during embryogenesis that lead to the wide ranging symptoms of FASDs. The technological gap that precedes this is a method that can robustly expose developing fly embryos to ethanol while also allowing high-throughput live imaging and data acquisition. The objective of this project is to develop enabling technologies for whole embryo imaging to uncover the mechanisms through which embryonic ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis and developmental patterning that ultimately lead to FASDs. In order to address the technological gap we are developing a microfluidic system that can culture and expose live Drosophila embryos to ethanol in a highly-parallelized manner. This system will also enable live imaging of embryogenesis, so that we can better understand how ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis. Furthermore, the microfluidic system will be integrated with tissue clearing techniques that will enable whole embryo imaging and thus allow us to visualize whole embryo gene expression patterns. In this study, we will study mutants of key enzymes to better elucidate their roles in FASD. Using this device, I aim to better our understanding about the physical and gene expression changes involved with FASDs. Microfluidic systems will be integrated with computer automation programs that will increase data acquisition rates. Data analysis will be streamlined through the development of computer vision algorithms that will help identify phenotypical changes associated with ethanol exposure that are non-obvious and likely to be missed by manual annotation. This project will not only enlarge the repertoire of tools available for developmental biology in general, but also will have significant impact on ethanol teratology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop a high-throughput, microfluidics-based system for studying the physical and genetic origins of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The results of this project will greatly increase our understanding of how prenatal ethanol exposure affects early embryogenesis and elucidate the mechanism through which ethanol exposure results in a wide range of developmental defects. Insights gained from this project will lead to novel treatments to help reduce ethanol teratogenicity and prevent the onset of FASDs.             ",Microfluidics-Enabled High-Throughput Studies on Early Embryonic Development,8912850,F31AA023160,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Body Size', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Congenital neurologic anomalies', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Cues', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Ethanol', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Morphogenesis', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teratogens', 'Teratology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'brain size', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'developmental genetics', 'fly', 'functional disability', 'gastrulation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'miniaturize', 'mutant', 'nervous system development', 'neuroblast', 'novel', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'synaptogenesis', 'tool']",NIAAA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2015,37977,-0.06704920166814207
"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials.

"A Strength Analysis Tool for Studying Healthy Aging via Exercise in C. elegans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exercise is arguably the most potent approach we can take to defer physical decline associated with aging and to protect against late onset diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Molecular understanding of how exercise benefits translate into healthy aging is thus of definitive medical interest. We study fundamental processes relevant to healthy aging in the 959-celled nematode C. elegans. Recently we made a fascinating discovery-C. elegans can exercise (swim) to exhibit training benefits, and appear to gain benefits by molecular pathways conserved in humans. Our initial model development opens up a new research area for understanding how tissue-specific and organism-wide health benefits are induced by exercise, and creates a novel paradigm for identifying exercise mimetic drugs that might promote healthy aging. To really harvest the potential of this model, we need to measure the strength of the tiny C. elegans. We collaborated to develop a strength test in which trained animals thread through a matrix of deformable pillars, and the extent of pillar deflection is used to calculate force. Our ""NemaFlex"" force detection device is the quantitative foundation with which we expect to break new ground in understanding exercise impact on healthy aging. Here we propose required development to enhance assay throughput and pursue applications that will not only anchor this technology as an essential component of C. elegans exercise evaluation but also accelerate studies on exercise biology and healthy aging in this powerful model. Aim 1 is to develop a novel high throughput tool for direct strength evaluation in C. elegans.  This aim will generate an essential tool for analysis of C. elegans strength at multiple life stages, define the exercise regimen that will become the anchor protocol in the field, and reveal features of training in this model. Aim 2 is to use NemaFlex to evaluate exercise mimetic drugs & to facilitate focused pilot genetic screens. This aim will establish critical proof-of-principle for genetic and drug discovery using the NemaFlex. Aim 3 is to initiate dissection of the functional and molecular relationship between exercise and healthy aging, grounded in NemaFlex force measures of training benefits.  To begin, we will test how optimized strength training tracks with a broad spectrum of healthspan indicators that decline with age, we will investigate impact of cessation of training on aging quality, and we will ask if exercise mimetic drugs extend healthspan in the absence of training. Our goals will create novel technology that for the first time permits facile quantitativ analysis of exercise adaptations in the powerful C. elegans genetic model. Accomplishment of our tractable aims will anchor a new subfield of genetic investigation of exercise and healthy aging that may influence design of interventions that broadly promote health and defer aging.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Exercise has a profound positive impact on health of the aging population in that it protects against age-associated diseases including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, at the same time it maintains muscle, immune system, and nervous system function in aging. We are developing the first exercise model in the simple animal C. elegans, in which training benefits appear mediated by conserved mechanisms and exercise promotes healthy aging. We will optimize a novel tool for direct strength measurement of these tiny 959-celled animals and show how our device can facilitate searches for exercise mimetic drugs and genes that are associated with training adaptations, and can also help define exercise impact on a broad range of healthy aging measures. The experimental advantages of C. elegans may yield unexpected insights that inspire development of novel interventions that protect against age-associated disease and age-associated decline.              ",A Strength Analysis Tool for Studying Healthy Aging via Exercise in C. elegans,8936078,R21AG050503,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biology of Aging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pump', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Swimming', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aging population', 'anti aging', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'healthy aging', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'mimetics', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'strength training', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIA,TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,235630,0.017436460378038934
"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.            ",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,8815240,R01NS086885,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Afghanistan', 'Amnesia', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iraq', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Moods', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reliance', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sports', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'executive function', 'gray matter', 'inattention', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,344166,0.04156488978333522
"Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Abstract Cognition in later life deteriorates when age-associated degenerative and other pathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand, counteract or compensate for those processes through neuroplastic, reparative responses. Thus, while clinicopathological correlation studies show significant associations of plaques, tangles, infarctions and other lesions with cognitive impairment, the relationships are imperfect, and it is increasingly recognized that some elderly persons may have abundant pathology and yet still are unimpaired. We propose an innovative clinicopathological approach in the richly characterized Religious Orders Study (ROS) cohort to identify candidate proteins and pathways that best confer cognitive resilience despite the presence of neurodegenerative disease pathologies. To accomplish this we apply non-biased stratification in the ROS cohort to identify three distinct test groups of 60 each: 1) AD-Dementia (dementia with abundant plaque and tangle pathology), 2) AD-Resilient (normal cognition despite abundant AD plaque. tangle and other pathology), and 3) Healthy (normal cognition and minimal AD or other pathology). We will measure the expression of >500 proteins that span functional families of apoptosis, synaptic neurotransmission and neuroplasticity, metabolic, inflammatory, cytoskeletal, signal transduction pathways and others. We will test two hypotheses that pro-apoptotic proteins and synaptic plasticity proteins differentiate the clinicopathological category groups and we will conduct machine learning approaches to further identify these and novel analytes that best predict categories. Based on these analyses, we will generate a targeted multi-analyte immunoassay panel. This will be used to validate the association of candidate proteins with cognitive resilience in another set of 480 ROS cases.

"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources.

"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking.  Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (principal investigator) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting-edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals.  By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 application builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health.  In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study.  Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities.         Public Health Relevance: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking.  Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This application will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.

"Healthspan Analysis of C. elegans Strains Treated with Candidate Anti Aging Inter     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human aging is associated with physical and cognitive decline as well as a marked increase of susceptibility to cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease. As such, the promotion of healthy aging, with extended resistance to decline, is a major goal of medical research. To address this problem, simple animals models such as the nematode C. elegans have been studied, providing molecular insights into the genes and drug interventions that modulate conserved aging processes. The goal of the proposed work is to participate in a co-operative scientific group that tests drugs for the abilityto extend healthy aging and promote longevity in the C. elegans model. A specific emphasis will be to test promising drugs on a collection of natural variants of C. elegans, which will seek to represent the extensive genetic heterogeneity in the human population-those drugs that confer similar outcomes across a diverse population will be considered to have an increased change of being efficacious in higher organisms. Our first goal is to conduct a fast preliminary evaluation o how diverse species variants age, using two fast assays of aging quality that monitor conserved processes that accompany human aging: 1) analysis of auto fluorescent lipofuscin and advanced glycation end products, which accumulate to high levels in C. elegans reference strain N2 that age poorly but remain at low levels in animals that age gracefully; 2) diminished locomotory capacity, which we evaluate with powerful computer vision analysis programs. We will use this preliminary data to select a test set of strains for our second goal: drug screening across a diverse population from the same species for promotion of longevity and healthspan. Our expertise in developing rapidly assessed healthspan measures should facilitate drug dose selection as well as healthspan evaluation. Overall, the proposed study will definitively shed insight into how natural variation within a species impacts longevity and healthspan. Pharmacological interventions that robustly promote strong healthspan across a varied population target should be identified.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will identify drug interventions that improve the length of life and/or the quality of aging in a simple animal model. Data obtained by testing a genetically diverse test set is anticipated to identify drugs with high potential to be efficaciousin a diverse human population.

"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,8670743,P30ES006096,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Allergic Disease', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health education', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Nature', 'Neurology', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Power Plants', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'environmental agent', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'health science research', 'high risk', 'human capital', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lipid disorder', 'malignant endocrine gland neoplasm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'symposium']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2014,1739696,0.029234890562166004
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through  multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,8618418,K99AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tissue fixing', 'tool']",NIA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2014,90000,0.011731272123350126
"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8691819,R01ES020819,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Electron Transport', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fumarates', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hypoxia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Staging', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Succinates', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin A Deficiency', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'environmental stressor', 'environmental toxicology', 'extracellular', 'high risk', 'human population study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'nucleotide metabolism', 'organic acid', 'phenyl ether', 'pollutant', 'protein misfolding', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'statistics', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2014,373821,0.026680090447523473
"Microfluidics-Enabled High-Throughput Studies on Early Embryonic Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal alcohol exposure causes a range of developmental disorders that are commonly referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The most severe case of FASDs is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and is characterized by growth deficiencies, craniofacial malformations, and both structural and functional central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. The combination of technological limitations that decrease experimental throughput and the inherent stochasticity of biological processes eliminate the ability to gain a quantitative understanding about the onset and progression of ethanol-related developmental disorders. As a result there is not much known mechanistically about how ethanol exposure manifests as FASDs. Here, we aim to develop a microfluidic-based system that enables high-throughput and high-content studies to elucidate the effects of ethanol exposure on embryogenesis. The model organism Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) has been shown to be a model of FASDs, because Drosophila exhibits similar phenotypical defects as humans when embryos are raised on ethanol solutions. It has yet to be seen how ethanol exposure affects developmental processes that occur during embryogenesis that lead to the wide ranging symptoms of FASDs. The technological gap that precedes this is a method that can robustly expose developing fly embryos to ethanol while also allowing high-throughput live imaging and data acquisition. The objective of this project is to develop enabling technologies for whole embryo imaging to uncover the mechanisms through which embryonic ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis and developmental patterning that ultimately lead to FASDs. In order to address the technological gap we are developing a microfluidic system that can culture and expose live Drosophila embryos to ethanol in a highly-parallelized manner. This system will also enable live imaging of embryogenesis, so that we can better understand how ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis. Furthermore, the microfluidic system will be integrated with tissue clearing techniques that will enable whole embryo imaging and thus allow us to visualize whole embryo gene expression patterns. In this study, we will study mutants of key enzymes to better elucidate their roles in FASD. Using this device, I aim to better our understanding about the physical and gene expression changes involved with FASDs. Microfluidic systems will be integrated with computer automation programs that will increase data acquisition rates. Data analysis will be streamlined through the development of computer vision algorithms that will help identify phenotypical changes associated with ethanol exposure that are non-obvious and likely to be missed by manual annotation. This project will not only enlarge the repertoire of tools available for developmental biology in general, but also will have significant impact on ethanol teratology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop a high-throughput, microfluidics-based system for studying the physical and genetic origins of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The results of this project will greatly increase our understanding of how prenatal ethanol exposure affects early embryogenesis and elucidate the mechanism through which ethanol exposure results in a wide range of developmental defects. Insights gained from this project will lead to novel treatments to help reduce ethanol teratogenicity and prevent the onset of FASDs.             ",Microfluidics-Enabled High-Throughput Studies on Early Embryonic Development,8721107,F31AA023160,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Body Size', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Congenital neurologic anomalies', 'Cues', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Ethanol', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Morphogenesis', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teratogens', 'Teratology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'brain size', 'craniofacial', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'developmental genetics', 'fly', 'functional disability', 'gastrulation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malformation', 'miniaturize', 'mutant', 'nervous system development', 'neuroblast', 'novel', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'synaptogenesis', 'tool']",NIAAA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2014,42676,-0.06704920166814207
"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials. The overall aim of this project is to identify multimodal biomarkers of FTLD.",Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration,8707928,K01AG043503,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Commit', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Country', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychology', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'social', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2014,128358,0.006389007490398348
"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Abstract Cognition in later life deteriorates when age-associated degenerative and other pathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand, counteract or compensate for those processes through neuroplastic, reparative responses. Thus, while clinicopathological correlation studies show significant associations of plaques, tangles, infarctions and other lesions with cognitive impairment, the relationships are imperfect, and it is increasingly recognized that some elderly persons may have abundant pathology and yet still are unimpaired. We propose an innovative clinicopathological approach in the richly characterized Religious Orders Study (ROS) cohort to identify candidate proteins and pathways that best confer cognitive resilience despite the presence of neurodegenerative disease pathologies. To accomplish this we apply non-biased stratification in the ROS cohort to identify three distinct test groups of 60 each: 1) AD-Dementia (dementia with abundant plaque and tangle pathology), 2) AD-Resilient (normal cognition despite abundant AD plaque. tangle and other pathology), and 3) Healthy (normal cognition and minimal AD or other pathology). We will measure the expression of >500 proteins that span functional families of apoptosis, synaptic neurotransmission and neuroplasticity, metabolic, inflammatory, cytoskeletal, signal transduction pathways and others. We will test two hypotheses that pro-apoptotic proteins and synaptic plasticity proteins differentiate the clinicopathological category groups and we will conduct machine learning approaches to further identify these and novel analytes that best predict categories. Based on these analyses, we will generate a targeted multi-analyte immunoassay panel. This will be used to validate the association of candidate proteins with cognitive resilience in another set of 480 ROS cases. Our focus on the neurobiology of resilient brain aging will be an important counterpoint and complement to historical and current efforts focused on the neurobiology of disease pathology.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Cognitive decline in aging arises when age-associated neuropathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand or adapt to those processes. We propose an innovative clinicopathological approach to identify candidate proteins and pathways that best confer cognitive resilience despite the presence of neurodegenerative disease pathologies. Using antibody microarrays for discovery and multi-analyte immunoassays for validation in brain tissues from participants of the Religious Orders Study, we will identify potential novel mechanisms of cognitive resilience in aging.

"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Where people spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. Previous studies have only looked at places near to home. This project will assess behaviors in different locations across the day and relate exposure to different environments to biological outcomes such as insulin resistance.                ",(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk,8590146,R01CA179977,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'Calories', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Code', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Income', 'Inflammation', 'Information Systems', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recreation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Self Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'demographics', 'density', 'fast food', 'food environment', 'good diet', 'inflammatory marker', 'land use', 'learned behavior', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'residence', 'sedentary', 'sugar', 'tv watching']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,733604,0.01363248837811226
"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking.  Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (principal investigator) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting-edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals.  By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 application builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health.  In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study.  Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities.         Public Health Relevance: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking.  Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This application will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.                ","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",8566379,K99ES022986,"['13 year old', '4 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Burden', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'analytical tool', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deciduous tooth', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'forest', 'innovation', 'lead exposure', 'longitudinal design', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2013,102242,0.07346697954352889
"Healthspan Analysis of C. elegans Strains Treated with Candidate Anti Aging Inter     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human aging is associated with physical and cognitive decline as well as a marked increase of susceptibility to cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease. As such, the promotion of healthy aging, with extended resistance to decline, is a major goal of medical research. To address this problem, simple animals models such as the nematode C. elegans have been studied, providing molecular insights into the genes and drug interventions that modulate conserved aging processes. The goal of the proposed work is to participate in a co-operative scientific group that tests drugs for the abilityto extend healthy aging and promote longevity in the C. elegans model. A specific emphasis will be to test promising drugs on a collection of natural variants of C. elegans, which will seek to represent the extensive genetic heterogeneity in the human population-those drugs that confer similar outcomes across a diverse population will be considered to have an increased change of being efficacious in higher organisms. Our first goal is to conduct a fast preliminary evaluation o how diverse species variants age, using two fast assays of aging quality that monitor conserved processes that accompany human aging: 1) analysis of auto fluorescent lipofuscin and advanced glycation end products, which accumulate to high levels in C. elegans reference strain N2 that age poorly but remain at low levels in animals that age gracefully; 2) diminished locomotory capacity, which we evaluate with powerful computer vision analysis programs. We will use this preliminary data to select a test set of strains for our second goal: drug screening across a diverse population from the same species for promotion of longevity and healthspan. Our expertise in developing rapidly assessed healthspan measures should facilitate drug dose selection as well as healthspan evaluation. Overall, the proposed study will definitively shed insight into how natural variation within a species impacts longevity and healthspan. Pharmacological interventions that robustly promote strong healthspan across a varied population target should be identified.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will identify drug interventions that improve the length of life and/or the quality of aging in a simple animal model. Data obtained by testing a genetically diverse test set is anticipated to identify drugs with high potential to be efficaciousin a diverse human population. This study may lead to pharmacological interventions that protect against physical deterioration, cognitive decline, and disease susceptibility in the elderly human population.                ",Healthspan Analysis of C. elegans Strains Treated with Candidate Anti Aging Inter,8582418,U01AG045864,"['Address', 'Advanced Glycosylation End Products', 'Advisory Committees', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Distant', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lipofuscin', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Metabolic', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nematoda', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogeny', 'Pigments', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Staging', 'Swimming', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti aging', 'drug testing', 'genetic variant', 'healthy aging', 'impression', 'improved', 'insight', 'male', 'middle age', 'multiple drug use', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'species difference', 'willingness']",NIA,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",U01,2013,456985,0.0031344785719502953
"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.

The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8484404,R01ES020819,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Electron Transport', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fumarates', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hypoxia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Staging', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Succinates', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin A Deficiency', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'environmental stressor', 'environmental toxicology', 'extracellular', 'high risk', 'human population study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'nucleotide metabolism', 'organic acid', 'phenyl ether', 'pollutant', 'protein misfolding', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'statistics', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2013,370345,0.026680090447523473
"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults.

"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Abstract Cognition in later life deteriorates when age-associated degenerative and other pathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand, counteract or compensate for those processes through neuroplastic, reparative responses. Thus, while clinicopathological correlation studies show significant associations of plaques, tangles, infarctions and other lesions with cognitive impairment, the relationships are imperfect, and it is increasingly recognized that some elderly persons may have abundant pathology and yet still are unimpaired. We propose an innovative clinicopathological approach in the richly characterized Religious Orders Study (ROS) cohort to identify candidate proteins and pathways that best confer cognitive resilience despite the presence of neurodegenerative disease pathologies. To accomplish this we apply non-biased stratification in the ROS cohort to identify three distinct test groups of 60 each: 1) AD-Dementia (dementia with abundant plaque and tangle pathology), 2) AD-Resilient (normal cognition despite abundant AD plaque. tangle and other pathology), and 3) Healthy (normal cognition and minimal AD or other pathology). We will measure the expression of >500 proteins that span functional families of apoptosis, synaptic neurotransmission and neuroplasticity, metabolic, inflammatory, cytoskeletal, signal transduction pathways and others. We will test two hypotheses that pro-apoptotic proteins and synaptic plasticity proteins differentiate the clinicopathological category groups and we will conduct machine learning approaches to further identify these and novel analytes that best predict categories. Based on these analyses, we will generate a targeted multi-analyte immunoassay panel. This will be used to validate the association of candidate proteins with cognitive resilience in another set of 480 ROS cases. Our focus on the neurobiology of resilient brain aging will be an important counterpoint and complement to historical and current efforts focused on the neurobiology of disease pathology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Cognitive decline in aging arises when age-associated neuropathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand or adapt to those processes.

"Systems Biology for Studies of Cognition in Down Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of Down syndrome (DS) is one in 700 live births, the life expectancy is now >50 years, and the average IQ is approximately 50. Therefore, DS is a significant social and medical issue. Many phenotypic features of DS, including cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical abnormalities, develop postnatally, arguing that effective therapeutics may be feasible. DS is due to an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (chr21) and the increased expression of genes encoded by it. Chr21 genes impact multiple pathways; there is cross talk among the pathways and functional interactions among chr21 genes. To address these complexities in pursuit of therapeutic targets, we propose a systems approach that is: (1) Hypothesis driven: Based on the functions of chr21 proteins and our behavioral/ molecular analysis of mouse models, we hypothesize that the cognitive deficits in DS are caused by perturbations in MAPK, PI3K and calcineurin pathways and NMDA and GABAA receptor (NMDAR, GABRA) function. We will bias our assays towards specific pathway components. (2) Discovery driven: in a less biased screen, we will use Reverse Phase and antibody arrays to assay for additional perturbations in 10s to 100s of samples and targets. (3) Multidisciplinary: The PI and co-PIs provide expertise in molecular biology, mouse behavioral and pharmacological analysis, and mathematical modeling. The goals of this proposal are to test our hypothesis, to develop new hypotheses by identifying and predicting additional critical pathway perturbations, and to identify potential targets for therapeutics. To fulfill these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Define basal perturbations in candidate pathways. Basal genotype-specific molecular profiles will include 48 protein measurements made in nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, from hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum, from five DS mouse models. 2. Define perturbations, in the same pathways in the same models, after behavioral and pharmacological stimulation by exposure to Contextual Fear Conditioning and treatment with NMDAR and GABRA antagonists. Genotype/stimulation-specific molecular profiles will be correlated with behavior. 3. Describe key pathway features and predict results of novel perturbations using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, supported by Inductive Machine Learning and Neural Networks. Data and pathways will be posted to our Chr21 Gene Function/Pathway database, http://chr21db.cudenver.edu.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations.

"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade.

"Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Abstract Cognition in later life deteriorates when age-associated degenerative and other pathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand, counteract or compensate for those processes through neuroplastic, reparative responses. Thus, while clinicopathological correlation studies show significant associations of plaques, tangles, infarctions and other lesions with cognitive impairment, the relationships are imperfect, and it is increasingly recognized that some elderly persons may have abundant pathology and yet still are unimpaired. We propose an innovative clinicopathological approach in the richly characterized Religious Orders Study (ROS) cohort to identify candidate proteins and pathways that best confer cognitive resilience despite the presence of neurodegenerative disease pathologies. To accomplish this we apply non-biased stratification in the ROS cohort to identify three distinct test groups of 60 each: 1) AD-Dementia (dementia with abundant plaque and tangle pathology), 2) AD-Resilient (normal cognition despite abundant AD plaque. tangle and other pathology), and 3) Healthy (normal cognition and minimal AD or other pathology). We will measure the expression of >500 proteins that span functional families of apoptosis, synaptic neurotransmission and neuroplasticity, metabolic, inflammatory, cytoskeletal, signal transduction pathways and others. We will test two hypotheses that pro-apoptotic proteins and synaptic plasticity proteins differentiate the clinicopathological category groups and we will conduct machine learning approaches to further identify these and novel analytes that best predict categories. Based on these analyses, we will generate a targeted multi-analyte immunoassay panel. This will be used to validate the association of candidate proteins with cognitive resilience in another set of 480 ROS cases. Our focus on the neurobiology of resilient brain aging will be an important counterpoint and complement to historical and current efforts focused on the neurobiology of disease pathology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Targeted Proteomics of Resilient Cognition in Aging Cognitive decline in aging arises when age-associated neuropathological processes overwhelm the brain's capacity to withstand or adapt to those processes. We propose an innovative clinicopathological approach to identify candidate proteins and pathways that best confer cognitive resilience despite the presence of neurodegenerative disease pathologies.

"Systems Biology for Studies of Cognition in Down Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of Down syndrome (DS) is one in 700 live births, the life expectancy is now >50 years, and the average IQ is approximately 50. Therefore, DS is a significant social and medical issue. Many phenotypic features of DS, including cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical abnormalities, develop postnatally, arguing that effective therapeutics may be feasible. DS is due to an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (chr21) and the increased expression of genes encoded by it. Chr21 genes impact multiple pathways; there is cross talk among the pathways and functional interactions among chr21 genes. To address these complexities in pursuit of therapeutic targets, we propose a systems approach that is: (1) Hypothesis driven: Based on the functions of chr21 proteins and our behavioral/ molecular analysis of mouse models, we hypothesize that the cognitive deficits in DS are caused by perturbations in MAPK, PI3K and calcineurin pathways and NMDA and GABAA receptor (NMDAR, GABRA) function. We will bias our assays towards specific pathway components. (2) Discovery driven: in a less biased screen, we will use Reverse Phase and antibody arrays to assay for additional perturbations in 10s to 100s of samples and targets. (3) Multidisciplinary: The PI and co-PIs provide expertise in molecular biology, mouse behavioral and pharmacological analysis, and mathematical modeling. The goals of this proposal are to test our hypothesis, to develop new hypotheses by identifying and predicting additional critical pathway perturbations, and to identify potential targets for therapeutics. To fulfill these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Define basal perturbations in candidate pathways. Basal genotype-specific molecular profiles will include 48 protein measurements made in nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, from hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum, from five DS mouse models. 2. Define perturbations, in the same pathways in the same models, after behavioral and pharmacological stimulation by exposure to Contextual Fear Conditioning and treatment with NMDAR and GABRA antagonists. Genotype/stimulation-specific molecular profiles will be correlated with behavior. 3.

"Systems Biology for Studies of Cognition in Down Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of Down syndrome (DS) is one in 700 live births, the life expectancy is now >50 years, and the average IQ is approximately 50. Therefore, DS is a significant social and medical issue. Many phenotypic features of DS, including cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical abnormalities, develop postnatally, arguing that effective therapeutics may be feasible. DS is due to an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (chr21) and the increased expression of genes encoded by it. Chr21 genes impact multiple pathways; there is cross talk among the pathways and functional interactions among chr21 genes. To address these complexities in pursuit of therapeutic targets, we propose a systems approach that is: (1) Hypothesis driven: Based on the functions of chr21 proteins and our behavioral/ molecular analysis of mouse models, we hypothesize that the cognitive deficits in DS are caused by perturbations in MAPK, PI3K and calcineurin pathways and NMDA and GABAA receptor (NMDAR, GABRA) function. We will bias our assays towards specific pathway components. (2) Discovery driven: in a less biased screen, we will use Reverse Phase and antibody arrays to assay for additional perturbations in 10s to 100s of samples and targets. (3) Multidisciplinary: The PI and co-PIs provide expertise in molecular biology, mouse behavioral and pharmacological analysis, and mathematical modeling. The goals of this proposal are to test our hypothesis, to develop new hypotheses by identifying and predicting additional critical pathway perturbations, and to identify potential targets for therapeutics. To fulfill these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Define basal perturbations in candidate pathways. Basal genotype-specific molecular profiles will include 48 protein measurements made in nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, from hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum, from five DS mouse models. 2. Define perturbations, in the same pathways in the same models, after behavioral and pharmacological stimulation by exposure to Contextual Fear Conditioning and treatment with NMDAR and GABRA antagonists. Genotype/stimulation-specific molecular profiles will be correlated with behavior. 3.

"Towards a cognitive framework for understanding cellular behavior Abstract Free-living cells display strong genome-wide transcriptional responses to changes in individual environmental parameters such as oxygen and temperature. Such transcriptional dynamics are thought to be the basis of a homeostatic response that attempts to reverse the immediate intracellular consequences resulting from the specific change in the environment. I present an alternative interpretation where transcriptional responses reflect a multifaceted behavioral program in response to global changes in the environment that are anticipated to follow the perturbation. This results from the fact that native microbial habitats are highly structured, giving rise to strong correlations between environmental parameters. Over geological timescales, such correlations can be internalized through an ""associative learning"" process that shapes the connectivity and dynamics of regulatory networks. Such internal models should allow microbes to predict the future trajectory of the environment based on immediate sensory information. We have seen evidence of this anticipatory behavior in responses of the bacterium Escherichia coli to changes in temperature and oxygen that correspond to transitions between the outside environment and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. These internal representations seem to reflect a true associative learning paradigm, since they show plasticity upon exposure to novel environments. These phenomena increasingly demand that we interpret microbial behaviors from a cognitive perspective, much as we do for understanding animal behaviors. I propose a multi-faceted research program aimed at 1) establishing that these phenomena, indeed, represent cognitive modeling of microbial habitats, 2) revealing the underlying network mechanisms, and 3) exploring associative learning of novel environments through laboratory experimental evolution. The proposed work establishes deep connections between the disparate fields of microbial ecology, regulatory network evolution, and behavior. In so doing, it challenges the dominance of the century-old notion of homeostasis, with fundamental implications for how we understand and control microbial behavior, especially in the context of disease. n/a",Towards a cognitive framework for understanding cellular behavior,7555864,DP1OD003787,"['Acidity', 'Acids', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Aerobic', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Behavior', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Association Learning', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacteroides fragilis', 'Base Pairing', 'Basic Science', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Carbon', 'Cell Respiration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemotaxis', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Coupling', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Cytochromes', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Depth', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Drops', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Employee Strikes', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Figs - dietary', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Global Change', 'Growth', 'Habitats', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Homeostasis', 'Homo', 'Human', 'Hybridization Array', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Physiology', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Detection', 'Natural Selections', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'New York', 'Nitrogen', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oral cavity', 'Organism', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Output', 'Oxidases', 'Oxygen', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Perception', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Photons', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Psychological Manipulation', 'Psychology', 'Pulse taking', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Salts', 'Science', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'abstracting', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'cytochrome c oxidase', 'day', 'density', 'design', 'electron donor', 'enteric pathogen', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'life history', 'microbial', 'microbial disease', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'novel', 'null mutation', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'quorum sensing', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'response', 'second messenger', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",OD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,DP1,2008,805000,0.0067184599327478585
"Higher Throughput Behavioral Screening of Cognitive Enhancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to NIMH research topic J1, neuroscience and basic behavioral science in the SBIR solicitation and PA-04-086, development of high throughput tools for brain and behavior. We aim to alleviate the bottleneck in drug discovery for cognitive dysfunction with CognoCube(tm), an automated high-throughput system of behavioral analysis of cognitive function. CognoCube(tm) will comprise innovative automated testing, computer vision, and machine-learning algorithms to capture and integrate behavioral effects of drugs affecting cognitive function. CognoCube will capture many cognitive domains of high degree of homology between humans and rodents that are relevant in CNS disorders such as schizophrenia, dementia, attention-deficit disorder and ageing. This system will provide rapid and accurate indices of the therapeutic potential of novel cognitive enhancers. Phase I will be focused on proof of concept, namely, capture of behaviors relevant to targeted cognitive domains, sensitivity to pharmacological manipulation and robust bioinformatic analysis. The CognoCube(tm) system will expand its capacity during Phase II of the project to be able to assess a library of 1000 compounds per year. With libraries chosen to provide a high likelihood of CNS activity we expect to be able to detect up to a dozen new compounds per year with CNS activity in the area of cognition. Those compounds will be further assessed with standard tests of cognition and their mechanism of action will be studied through pharmacological means and binding profiling. Commercial value: The population that could benefit from new and improved cognitive enhancers is estimated at more than 30 million in the United States alone. Major challenges for drug discovery in this area include the lack of reliable and efficient in vivo testing systems. Although standardized objective test batteries have been developed for evaluation of human cognition, there is no such standard battery for rodents.

"FINGER COORDINATION IN ELDERLY Impairment of hand function with age is a major disabling factor limiting many activities of daily living.  A decrease in the hand dexterity may lead to a loss of independence and require external care during most everyday activities.  Our present understanding of the functioning of the human hand and changes in its function with age is limited.  This makes it imperative to perform studies directed at improved understanding of the hand function and its deterioration with age. Series of studies on control subjects and preliminary findings in a small group of elderly subjects have allowed us to formulate two major hypotheses: (a) Aging is associated with selective impairment of intrinsic hand muscles; and (b) Aging is associated with an increase in force deficit during multi-finger tasks.  The following research program has been elaborated for an analysis of possible contribution of these age-related changes to the loss of hand dexterity with age: (1) Confirmation of the preliminary conclusions using a larger subject population and a wider spectrum of tasks; (2) Analysis of the effects of these changes on crucial features of multi-finger synergies such as minimization of secondary moments and patterns of variability of individual finger forces (error compensation among fingers); (3) Analysis of possible changes in finger and hand coordination during more common actions such as gripping and bi-manual object handling; and (4) Analysis of correlations between changes in the indices of finger coordination and activities of daily living that involve hand function. Seven experiments on elderly and control subjects are suggested that include force production by sets of fingers in gripping and pressing tasks, self-imposed perturbations, and bi-manual object handling.  The research will combine noninvasive behavioral, biomechanical, electrophysiological, and modeling methods, as well as questionnaires.

"Neural network model of noise-induced hearing loss DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the proposed work is to develop a prediction model using radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) that will predict the auditory consequences of excessive noise exposure in a chinchilla model. The RBFNN model will be fed training data from our existing database (chinchilla) consisting of noise exposure metrics and audiometric/histological/otoacoustic emission data acquired from previously exposed animals. Once trained, the model will be able to predict the auditory consequences of exposure to any noise environment characterized by ten noise metrics and five biological variables of the animals that are input to the model. There are two phases to this research. The first phase is the design of the system structure and implementation software (Year 1). The second phase involves training the system using an extensive database consisting of more than 2500 subjects on which comprehensive exposure and audiometric/histological data are available (Year 2). The training period will be an iterative process in which the RBFNN will be modified as training proceeds. The prediction model can also be used to design experimental conditions from which the model can be experimentally tested. The successful demonstration of the application of a RBFNN to the prediction of noise-induced auditory effects has considerable potential for application to the assessment of industrial and military noise environments for the protection of hearing in humans, and can result in a considerable savings in the amount of work/resources that are needed to develop new and improved noise standards. Specifically, given the many similarities in the response to noise of the chinchilla and the human, the model can be used to identify combinations of parameters of an exposure that are important determinants of damage that would also be applicable to human exposure conditions. The chinchilla model can be used as a template or a guide for developing a human model possibly from some of the existing human data from which current standards were developed. n/a",Neural network model of noise-induced hearing loss,6941215,R03OH008175,"['artificial intelligence', 'chinchilla', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'disease /disorder model', 'environmental exposure', 'model design /development', 'noise biological effect', 'noise induced deafness']",NIOSH,PLATTSBURGH STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2005,71735,0.025916335995141482

"Computational Toxicity Assessment Using Omic Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The application of modern high throughput genomic and metabonomic technologies to the field of toxicology will provide significant breakthroughs and advances. By simultaneously looking at data on gene expression and metabolite concentrations, a more accurate and complete picture of cellular behavior can be determined. Using statistical and mathematical algorithms applied to high throughput data, toxicant exposure characterization will be computed including identification of type of exposure and estimates of dose amount. In the current proposal, we intend to apply the latest multivariate linear and non-linear statistical and mathematical techniques to find subtle and complex patterns in the data that are consistent with validated samples of known toxic exposure. By using supervised machine learning techniques, training data with cross-validated measurements will be used to quantitatively measure the accuracy of the proposed statistical techniques. By applying these techniques to a wide variety of both public and in house data samples consisting of gene expression data and metabolomic NMR concentration data, small correlations and patterns can be measured and used to characterize the type and amount of environmental and toxicant exposure to host organisms. The basic research carried out in this proposal can result in a useful analysis tool that has a broad applications in drug discovery as well as diagnostic applications in monitoring of host organism exposure to harmful substances.         n/a",Computational Toxicity Assessment Using Omic Data,6882458,R43ES013595,"['data management', 'environmental exposure', 'gene expression', 'high throughput technology', 'mathematics', 'metabolomics', 'statistics /biometry', 'technology /technique development', 'toxicology']",NIEHS,"GENOMATICA, INC.",R43,2005,125602,-0.01164936561588648
"FINGER COORDINATION IN ELDERLY Impairment of hand function with age is a major disabling factor limiting many activities of daily living.

"Built Environment Assessment through Computer visiON (BEACON): Applying Deep Learning to Street-Level and Satellite Images to Estimate Built Environment Effects on Cardiovascular Health PROJECT SUMMARY Over 80% of the US population resides in urban areas, and the built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may drive cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain, and by influencing exposures to environmental factors, such as air pollution, extreme temperatures, and noise. Evidence for the built environment and CVD has been dominated by cross-sectional studies with nonspecific exposure assessment. Developing precise, time-varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to establish causal relationships between the built environment and CVD, which are crucial to informing policy-relevant, actionable interventions. It is now possible to estimate such exposure metrics at scale in prospective cohort studies using deep learning computer vision methods, a class of machine learning algorithms that can accurately process images, combined with time-varying nationwide street-level imagery, high resolution satellite data, and novel mobile health technologies. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing built environment exposure measures from deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data in participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (N=500), and to geocoded residential addresses from nationwide Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts (N=288,000). We will create built environment exposure measures by leveraging deep learning algorithms applied to nationwide Google Street View imagery (2007-2020) and high-resolution Landsat satellite data (1986-2020) to create fine-scale, time-varying built environment metrics of the natural environment (e.g., trees), physical environment (e.g., sidewalks), perceptions (e.g., safety), and urban form (e.g., compact high-rise). We will use a mix of innovative analytical approaches to determine the effect of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence across different time horizons. First, we will append these metrics to time-activity patterns of participants who have collected minute-level data on GPS and physical activity from smartphones and consumer wearable devices to quantify how minute-level exposure to the built environment is related to CVD health behaviors. Next, we will apply novel built environment metrics to residential address histories of participants to estimate how self-reported CVD health behaviors change after their residential built environment changes. Last, we will examine the association between long-term cumulative residential exposure to the built environment and CVD incidence over 34 years of follow-up. Our work will enable us to measure built environment exposure from unprecedented perspectives in large prospective cohorts, to elucidate potential causal relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, and to better specify pathways to CVD incidence. Ultimately, our work will yield actionable insights to guide land use policy and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health. PROJECT NARRATIVE The built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain and by shaping exposures to environmental hazards (e.g., air pollution, extreme temperatures, noise); however, developing accurate, time- varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to build causal relationships between the built environment and CVD and to inform policy-relevant, actionable interventions. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing longitudinal built environment exposure measures from street-view and satellite imagery using deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data from a) 500 participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (NHS3) and b) over 34 years of geocoded residential addresses from three large nationwide cohorts of over 288,000 US adult women and men from the Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts.

"SYMPOSIUM ON COGNITIVE AUDITORY NEUROSCIENCE (SCAN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In recent years, human cognitive auditory neuroscience has made rapid strides due to advances in human neuroimaging, the advent of innovative machine learning/big data analytic approaches, and a greater mechanistic understanding of cognitive-sensory interactions in animal models. The dynamic landscape of this emergent field necessitates a highly interdisciplinary, human and translation-centric symposium that brings together expertise across academia and industry. This application requests partial funding for the Symposium on Cognitive Auditory Neuroscience (SCAN) to be hosted in Pittsburgh, PA in July 2020 and 2022, as a joint venture between Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). As a biennial meeting, SCAN aims to become the premiere intellectual and professional venue for current research in the emerging field of human cognitive auditory neuroscience. SCAN will incorporate elements typical to academic conferences (research talks, posters) as well as novel ideas that promote ‘blue sky’ thinking in this rapidly evolving field. SCAN will assiduously and innovatively work towards inclusivity and creating an atmosphere that encourages intellectual and professional engagement from women, underrepresented minorities, and individuals with disabilities. Another critical aim of the SCAN is to foster industry-academic partnerships with an eye towards translation of basic research and fostering career opportunities for trainees. Pittsburgh is uniquely situated to launch SCAN. With an enviable concentration of co-located auditory neuroscience expertise, Pittsburgh is also an intellectual hub for industries/start-ups engaged in in machine learning, natural language processing, and speech recognition. SCAN will leverage these advantages to foster growth and innovation tied to core missions of the National Institutes of Deafness and Communication Disorders.

"Deep Learning of Street View Imagery to assess Urban Green Space Relationships with Mental Health:  A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY The built environment is an important modifiable determinant of human health, yet our ability to understand its effects on human health have been limited by the lack of scalable data on specific components (and exposures) of the built environment. The emergence of ubiquitous geo-referenced imagery in the United States (e.g. Google Street View Imagery), combined with recent advances in image processing using deep learning algorithms, offers unprecedented opportunity for measuring street-level built environment features at scales needed for population-based research. To develop and demonstrate the potential of deep learning algorithms for environmental health research we will: develop methods to assess green space features using street view imagery and deep learning algorithms; create new deep learning algorithms to predict urban green space quality, stress reduction and restorative potential; and apply new street view measures to 9,070 adult Twin Pairs in the Washington Twin Registry to determine associations between green space and mental health. Our proposed study will dramatically move the field of environmental health forward by provided a completely new, transferable and scalable exposure assessment method for assessing built environment exposures relevant to human health and provide robust information on how urban green space influences mental health. Overall, our new approach will provide rich new data sources for environmental epidemiologists, city planners, policy makers and neighborhoods and communities at large.

With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9999949,R00ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'adverse birth outcomes', 'base', 'big-data science', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2020,247463,0.017800453913186128
"Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have well-established risk factors such as physical activity (PA), depression, and hypertension (HTN). These risk factors disproportionately affect racial minority populations, but the mechanisms underlying racial health disparities are not well understood. In this, geographic factors could be key, as PA, depression and HTN are strongly affected by geographic exposures, including green space. However, green space is typically measured with questionnaires, which have substantial error, or satellite-based indexes that are nonspecific and provide no information on the type of vegetation (e.g., tree vs. grass), nor whether the vegetation is within view at the street level. As a result, no study has quantified the contribution of green space to racial disparities in ADRD. And while novel technologies such as Google Street Views (GSV) imaging are promising data sources for capturing unique measures of green space, managing, processing, and analyzing high-dimensional data present significant logistical and analytical challenges, especially when linking these data to existing data from large prospective cohorts. Finally, we need to understand green space in the context of other potentially correlated geographic exposures, or the urban exposome—the totality of life- course geographic exposures (the set of green space, air pollutants, noise, built environment, and social environment)—to estimate which factors drive health. This proposal will address these challenges by using GSV imaging to assess the effect of green space on PA, depression, and HTN, as well as subsequent ADRD risk within the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)—a 10-year longitudinal study of 6,814 men and women without clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline from 4 racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic White, African-American, Chinese, and Hispanic). Aim 1 will quantify the effect of specific aspects of green space (e.g. trees, grass, shrubs, plants) on ADRD and cognitive decline and evaluate whether these associations differ according to race/ethnicity. Aim 2 will determine the indirect effect of green space on ADRD that is mediated through PA, depression, and HTN. Aim 3 will quantify exposome associations with ADRD and cognitive decline using untargeted data-driven approaches in conjunction with dimension reduction techniques and evaluate whether they differ according to race/ethnicity. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) implementing deep learning algorithms to analyze high-resolution geographic data, (2) cognitive function epidemiology, and (3) developing and refining data-driven approaches to perform exposome-informed epidemiological studies. These combined plans will successfully prepare the applicant for an independent research career focused on identifying modifiable geographic determinants of ADRD in diverse populations using innovative measures of geographic context. Project Narrative Green space or trees and natural vegetation can provide mental health benefits and possibly lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); however, green space is often measured poorly in epidemiologic research. I propose to integrate high-resolution images from Google Street Views to derive ground-level objective measurements of green space into a diverse prospective cohort study using deep learning algorithms, mediation analysis and geographic mixtures. This research will enable unprecedented perspectives on exposures that drive ADRD and related cognitive decline risk, and will provide translational insights into potential interventions to optimize opportunities for ADRD prevention and reduce racial disparities in ADRD.",Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment,9952648,K99AG066949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air Pollutants', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Baltimore', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chicago', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Green space', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Los Angeles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Plants', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Social Environment', 'Social Impacts', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'built environment', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'economic impact', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'healthy aging', 'high resolution imaging', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'men', 'multidimensional data', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial disparity', 'racial health disparity', 'racial minority', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'urban public health']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2020,129600,-0.005876205836863378
"Systems Immunology in Aging and Chronic Diseases of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The funds requested in this R13 application are for partial support of “Systems Immunology in Aging and Chronic Diseases of Aging” annual meetings to be offered each September from 2020 through 2022 at The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine (JAX-GM) in Farmington, Connecticut. This meeting builds on its very successful first instance in 2019 and will bring together up to 150 interdisciplinary scientists including molecular biologists, immunologists, computational biologists, and geriatricians, who share a common interest in understanding aging and aging-associated disease at the systems level. Many aging-associated diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, are influenced by dysfunctions in the immune system. Recent advances in genomic profiling techniques (e.g., single cell transcriptomics) provide an opportunity to uncover aging-related changes in human cells/tissues and to link these changes to health and lifespan. The wealth and complexity of data produced using these technologies is ever increasing, as is the need to develop advanced computational methods to mine and integrate these data. Despite this need, there are currently no formal venues at which scientists, specifically those in the aging field, can be trained in the basics and application of data mining techniques (i.e., machine learning algorithms). Furthermore, current conferences on aging are not aimed at specifically bringing together computational biologists, immunologists and basic and clinical aging researchers. Therefore, the objectives of this meeting are: (1) to recognize and emphasize the highly interdisciplinary nature of the aging field and to promote and accelerate collaborations and cross-pollination of ideas across the three disciplines: aging, immunology, and computational biology; (2) to provide trainees (students and postdoctoral fellows) an opportunity to closely interact with, and gain feedback from, more senior investigators to advance their projects and establish connections to help build their careers; and (3) to provide an opportunity for researchers in the field of aging to learn the basics of machine learning techniques, which they will be able to immediately apply to their own research upon return to their home institutions. We will reach these objectives through carrying out the following Aims. In Aim 1, we will organize an interdisciplinary meeting and hands-on workshop focused on aging and aging-related diseases. The meeting will include a 2-day seminar session featuring talks by leading scientists, followed by a 1-day hands-on workshop on the basics of machine learning. In Aim 2, we will promote interactions to foster collaborative research and career advancement, including through a poster session. In Aim 3, we will recruit diverse attendees. Our proposed speaker list features several female scientists, and we will use our partnership networks to specifically recruit attendees from nationally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. The ultimate goal of the meeting is to advance the aging research field through expediting collaborations and the understanding of aging-related genomic data via application of advanced data mining approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Aging and aging-associated diseases, such as Alzheimer's, cancer and cardiovascular disease, represent a significant and growing health and economic burden, with the elderly population of the US projected to double by 2030. Herein, we propose to organize an interdisciplinary conference with a hands-on computational training component that will bring together scientists from the fields of aging, immunology, and computational biology, which will enable creative collaborations and train early career scientists in the aging research field on the basics of advanced computational techniques to mine aging-related genomic data. This is ultimately expected to lead to a better molecular understanding of the aging process and to novel approaches for the improvement of human healthspan and/or lifespan.",Systems Immunology in Aging and Chronic Diseases of Aging,10070754,R13AG069519,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Career Mobility', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scholarship', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shock', 'Societies', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'cancer type', 'career', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically significant', 'data mining', 'deep learning algorithm', 'epigenomics', 'frailty', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'graduate student', 'health economics', 'healthspan', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'posters', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'senescence', 'single cell technology', 'skills', 'symposium', 'technology development', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIA,JACKSON LABORATORY,R13,2020,34380,0.014765045471837483
"BRINGING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS TO BEAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress.

"Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology OVERALL : ABSTRACT This is the third competing continuation for an accomplished Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS CC), The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The Director is Trevor M. Penning, PhD (The Thelma Brown and Henry Charles Molinoff Professor of Pharmacology) and the Deputy Director is Rebecca A. Simmons, MD (The Hallam Hurt Endowed Professor in Pediatrics). The Center is comprised of 71 members from 18 Departments and 5 Schools, with almost equal representation of basic and clinician-scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The CEET has built an institutional, regional and national identity in environmental health sciences (EHS) in the absence of a School of Public Health and Department of EHS at Penn. The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists within the CEET promotes translational environmental health research that addresses fundamental questions and translates knowledge into action to have a major impact on human health and disease consistent with the NIEHS Strategic Plan. The CEET mission is to “elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease, and translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national, and global communities”. This mission is accomplished through five aims. In Aim 1: We use a flexible thematic area structure to conduct translational environmental health research to improve precision public health. Our current themes are in Air Pollution & Lung Health; Environmental Exposures & Cancer; Windows-of- Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience. Each thematic area integrates the pillars or exposure science, adverse outcome constructs (pathways and networks) to explain the phenome with translation to communities and human subjects. In Aim 2: We conduct bi-directional communication with communities in S.E and N.E. Pennsylvania and use community engagement to set the research agenda for the CEET. In Aim 3: We provide a facility core structure to promote precision public health. Our Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core is adept in human subject study design and in conducting population exposure services, using cartographic modeling, GIS tools and biosensors. Biomarkers of exposure and effect are measured in our Translational Biomarker Core which conducts mass spectrometric assays at a level of precision and accuracy difficult to emulate elsewhere. The Exposure Biology Informatics Core brings to bear the power of computation, machine learning and AI to predict the toxicity of unknowns and integrate Big-data sets to recognize patterns in “omics” data and predict adverse outcomes. In Aim 4: We build capacity in environmental health sciences by funding pilot projects to Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and to senior investigators conducting environmental health research for the first time. In Aim 5: We cultivate the careers of ESI through a transformative Environmental Health Scientist Support Program that provides mentoring, grant proposal review, environmental health and Facility Core workshops. OVERALL : NARRATIVE The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) conducts research that links environmental exposures, to adverse outcomes and translates its findings to human subjects and communities to identify the most vulnerable and improve prevention, intervention and treatment through precision public health.

"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed.

"The Impact of Temperature and Pollution on Mortality, Morbidity, and Health Care Cost Among the Elderly OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Determinants of Vulnerability to Environmental Stress Among the Elderly ADRD Population As individuals live longer, healthier lives, the number of people living with, and dying from, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has risen. AD prevalence and mortality are expected to continue to rise in the future. However, while AD is fatal and individuals living with AD have high mortality rates, their immediate cause of death is usually respiratory disease or ischemic heart disease rather than dementia. Consequently, improving the health and quality of life of people living with ADRD depends on understanding their vulnerability to these diseases, and how these conditions interact with their dementia. Our proposed study focuses on the determinants of health and mortality among those in the Medicare population who have been identified as living with ADRD. Because cardiovascular and respiratory diseases have been identified as frequent causes of death among the ADRD population, we focus on an environmental stressor that increases the likelihood of death due to cardiovascular and respiratory causes: acute exposure to air pollution. Using a large dataset of Medicare beneficiaries and machine-learning techniques applied to quasi-random variation in pollution exposure generated by changes in local wind direction, we find that acute exposure to air pollution increases mortality risk for only about one quarter of the elderly. While individuals living with ADRD are much more likely to be in this vulnerable group than the typical Medicare beneficiary, we find that acute air pollution exposure does not increase mortality risk for a large fraction (44%) of Medicare beneficiaries living with ADRD. In this study, we will apply machine learning and “big data” techniques to Medicare administrative data, local characteristics, and atmospheric variables in order to understand why some individuals living with ADRD suffer harm from the increased cardiovascular and respiratory stress induced by air pollution exposure while others do not. These factors, once identified and verified in continuing research, will provide guidance that can improve the health and quality of life of individuals living with ADRD by better directing resources to those most in need and guiding interventions aimed at reducing vulnerability to these and other hazards. As part of the project, we will develop a publicly available database that provides the following data at the ZIP code level: ADRD prevalence, vulnerability to air pollution exposure among the ADRD population, and ZIP code level characteristics that have been shown to affect vulnerability. Other researchers can then use this data for any other study seeking to understand the effects of geographically defined factors or policies on the ADRD population. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative While Alzheimer’s disease is a fatal form of dementia, the top two immediate causes of death for people with Alzheimer’s disease are respiratory illness (55.5%) and ischemic heart disease (23.1%), which are both exacerbated by exposure to environmental hazards such as air pollution. In this study, we will apply machine learning and “big data” techniques to Medicare administrative data in order to identify risk factors that predict vulnerability to the harmful effects of pollution exposure for individuals living with ADRD, allowing for better targeting of resources to those most in need and contributing to the improvement of interventions aimed at reducing vulnerability to these and other hazards.","The Impact of Temperature and Pollution on Mortality, Morbidity, and Health Care Cost Among the Elderly",10123225,R01AG053350,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Big Data', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Environmental Wind', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Policies', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'beneficiary', 'environmental stressor', 'hazard', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'respiratory']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,R01,2020,376508,-0.04574496968974376
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. The proposed program will apply a novel dental biomarker of exposure to multiple chemicals and cutting-edge statistical methods to identify specific life stages including perinatal periods that correspond to increased susceptibility to neurodevelopmental effects of metal toxicant mixtures.",Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture,10005934,R01ES026033,"['8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Arsenic', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cadmium', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Manganese', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Nutrient', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deciduous tooth', 'developmental neurotoxicity', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'perinatal period', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'synergism', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,604973,0.05230906149547909
"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development award will: a) Lead to the development and validation of a pediatric-specific Environmental Enteropathy (EE) Deep Learning Net for small intestinal structure which is urgently needed to standardize the diagnosis, care, and research of EE worldwide; b) Employ computational methods to correlate Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing morphological EE features with multiomic data to provide comprehensive diagnostic and predictive criteria for EE, and c) Validation of promising circulating biomarkers against intestinal biopsies, the diagnostic gold standard for enteropathies. Successful completion of this work will channel our improved understanding of the gut's critical role in childhood stunting pathways towards effective interventions to improve nutrition and health in at risk populations.",Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy,9928452,K23DK117061,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Asia', 'Bangladeshi', 'Bile Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Celiac Disease', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Duodenum', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gluten', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human Pathology', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lactulose', 'Lamina Propria', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lymphocytosis', 'MS4A1 gene', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurocognitive', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Small Intestines', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Virginia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'enteric pathogen', 'epithelium regeneration', 'imaging approach', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'intraepithelial', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrition', 'oral vaccine', 'patient oriented', 'socioeconomics', 'tissue injury', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,K23,2020,192552,0.011629192431943358
"Interdisciplinary Infrastructure for Aging Research: Rochester Epidemiology Project PROJECT SUMMARY The National Institutes on Aging (NIA) has recommended strengthening research infrastructures to address future aging research questions (2016 Data Infrastructure Review Committee Report and PAR-16-367). In particular, they recommend: 1) integrating biological data into larger population-based studies; 2) increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) data and linking to medical care claims data; and 3) developing new approaches to collecting data to answer important scientific questions about mechanisms of aging. The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP; NIA R01 AG034676) is a unique infrastructure for studies of aging, because the REP collects longitudinal EHR data on all health conditions that come to medical attention for a large, Midwestern population. Therefore, the REP allows investigators to study all age-related diseases and outcomes. However, the REP has three significant gaps. First, the REP does not include biospecimens. Second, the REP is missing health care delivered outside of the health care institutions that partner with the REP, and it does not include information on filled prescriptions. Third, a significant proportion of EHR data is difficult to access due to two factors: 1) the full text of the EHRs includes extensive clinical notes about aging outcomes and geriatric syndromes, but these notes are not routinely coded for billing, and can only be accessed through laborious manual review; and 2) the REP health care partners use three different EHR systems, making it difficult to apply electronic data extraction tools across all partners. To address these three gaps, we will develop an interdisciplinary collaboration across experts in aging research, epidemiologic methods, biobanking, and medical informatics to create a new, comprehensive research infrastructure (“Bio-REP”) to support aging research. In the R21 phase, we will develop a comprehensive research infrastructure that combines the REP data with Mayo Clinic Biobank biospecimens, medical claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; Aim 1), and geriatric syndrome data that are included in the unstructured EHR clinical notes using Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP; Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will deploy NLP algorithms developed in Aim 2 in the clinical notes from two additional EHR systems (Aim 3), and we will conduct two demonstration projects. First, we will measure associations between novel aging-related biomarkers and aging-related outcomes (Aim 4). Second, we will determine whether two common medications that are hypothesized to impact aging (metformin and angiotensin receptor blockers) modify associations between aging biomarkers and aging outcomes (Aim 5). The new, robust Bio-REP infrastructure will support a wide range of efficient, cost-effective observational studies to characterize associations between aging-related biomarkers and specific diseases, geriatric syndromes, and drug utilization. Such studies are urgently needed to design effective clinical trials to improve the health span of the aging population.

"Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses As the population continues to age and rates of late-life cognitive impairment rise, early detection of cognitive impairment is increasingly important for the timely implementation of interventions and safety initiatives. This may be particularly important in individuals found to have high brain amyloid burden, putting them at particular risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) of the brain. Performance changes in challenging, complex, high-stakes daily activities, such as driving, and accompanying physiological responses may together provide an inexpensive avenue for early detection. This may serve the dual purpose of alerting individuals or health care providers to early cognitive impairment, as well as to potential safety issues. Sophisticated in-car technology that is increasingly becoming standard in new vehicles may provide the means to unobtrusively capture sensitive information about naturalistic driving behaviors and potentially assist with early detection of cognitive impairment. The proposed study will apply a novel approach to unobtrusively monitor older drivers in (a) naturalistic, (b) fixed course, and (c) simulator driving situations. Machine learning approaches will be used to select key features of driving behaviors and physiological measures of arousal in all driving scenarios and eye tracking measures from fixed and simulator drives to predict drivers’ clinical diagnosis: young adult drivers, healthy older drivers with and without high amyloid burden, and drivers with mild cognitive impairment with evident amyloid burden. The participants will be followed longitudinally in the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) with annual cognitive and neurological evaluations, as well as repeat driving and physiological testing at two years from baseline. Understanding and identifying changes in driving behaviors and how these predict who will develop clinically identifiable cognitive impairment will lead to the development of a model for early detection of cognitive decline and ADRD. This study will examine everyday driving behaviors and physiological measures obtained by in-car monitors during common driving situations (e.g., intersections, freeway ramps). The goal is to build a model that uses features from these in-car measures to detect small driving changes that may be the earliest indicators of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. Utilizing data gathered unobtrusively from vehicles is cost effective, readily available, and may alert individuals and health care providers of early cognitive concerns, as well as potential safety issues.",Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses,10044799,R01AG068338,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Arousal', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language Development', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Ramp', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Skin Temperature', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'driving behavior', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel strategies', 'older driver', 'programs', 'psychological aspect of aging', 'rate of change', 'recruit', 'response', 'smart watch', 'social', 'visual tracking', 'young adult', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,1506851,-0.016686758300991214
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia,9850564,R01DC013063,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cathodes', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Love', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug discovery', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'forgetting', 'frontal lobe', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'gaze', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sound', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'supervised learning', 'treatment services', 'voltage']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2020,466715,-0.05530442375609099
"Exploring the neural substrates of age-related cognitive decline in patients with knee osteoarthritis Abstract Both aging and chronic pain have a pronounced impact on the brain. Thus, the interplay of chronic pain, aging, and the brain may provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline and dementia. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disorder among the elderly population. Two recent studies with large sample sizes found that that knee OA was associated with a significantly increased risk for dementia. Nevertheless, why knee OA is associated with high dementia risk remains unknown. Taking advantage of the NCCIH / NIH funded project (R33 AT009310) on brain mechanisms of acupuncture and imagined acupuncture treatment of knee OA, this ancillary application will allow us to expand our research on cognitive decline in patients with knee OA. Specifically, with the support of new funding, we will 1) add a cohort of heathy controls (50 age- and gender-matched controls without knee OA), 2) collect blood samples to assess inflammation markers, and 3) add cognitive measurements, such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), to assess the cognitive function of both knee OA patients and controls. With newly collected data, we will combine machine learning methods and multimodality neuroimaging techniques to 1) calculate neuroimaging-based ‘brain age’ and compare the predicted age difference (PAD, difference between brain age and chronological age) between the knee OA patients and matched controls; 2) investigate the inflammation markers and brain structure and function (on cognition-related brain areas/networks) differences between the knee OA patients and controls; and 3) explore the association between inflammation markers, PAD, brain function and structure, and cognitive function as determined by MoCA score, as well as the modulation effect of alternative treatments on the above measurements. Relevance to Alzheimer’s disease and/or its Related to Dementia and  Narrative The aim of this ancillary application is to collect additional data to investigate the interplay between knee osteoarthritis, cognitive decline, and the brain.

"Role of the gut microbiome in pesticide-induced effects on child neurodevelopment SUMMARY Pesticides are pervasive in our environment, and have accumulated in drinking water reserves serving millions of people worldwide, causing growing concern since the potential adverse health effects are not fully understood. In 2017 alone, the world used about 6.8 million tons of pesticides, of which the world's largest usage is in China and the United States. More recently it has been discovered that pesticides have strong effects on microbial communities, extinguishing entire clades while promoting growth in others. Shifts in microbial composition have been associated with brain development, mood and behavior suggesting a strong link between the gut and the brain. We hypothesize that there may exist an unappreciated microbiome component to the adverse health effects of pesticide exposure. In this proposal, we will use a comprehensive approach to identify the microbial components of pesticide susceptibility to neurodevelopmental delay. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to 11 targeted pesticides on child neurodevelopment in a large well-defined human Mother and Child Microbiome Cohort (MCMC) consisting of 3000 mother and child pairs. Study participants are currently followed up regularly until the children reach 4 years of age. Comprehensive artificial intelligence analysis of pesticide exposure and children's early neurodevelopment data will identify key pesticides that negatively impact child development. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that prenatal exposure to pesticides can shift the composition of the GM and subsequently lead to abnormal neurodevelopment. We will integrate the child gut microbiome data with maternal pesticide exposure during pregnancy and child neurodevelopment data to investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to targeted pesticides on child gut microbiome and development. This Aim will identify specific gut bacteria or clades associated with child neurodevelopment. In Aim 3, we will use conventional and germ-free mouse models to elucidate mechanisms by which pesticide exposure can affect the gut microbiome and behavior. Conventionally housed pregnant mice will be exposed to pesticides and the gut microbiome and behavior (anxiety, memory, motor performance, social interaction) will be analyzed in their offspring. Also, germ-free mice will be colonized with specific bacteria or bacterial clades to study the causality of the impact of the GM on behavior. The long-term implications for human health are significant – it may be possible to increase tolerance/robustness to pesticide exposure by providing sensitive individuals with probiotics that have select degradation pathways. Moreover, this understanding is important in order to formulate novel preventive strategies including educating health practitioners, families, and public health providers and organizations regarding the potential risks of environmental exposures. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chemical and toxic substances, such as herbicides and pesticides pose some of the most common threats to environmental and human health. Our studies are designed to identify effects of prenatal pesticide exposure on child neurodevelopment and the role of the gut microbiome in mediating pesticide-induced adverse health effects.

"Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging PROJECT SUMMARY Progressive aging-related cognitive declines are associated with limitations in self-care and functional independence, deteriorating physical health, and impending dementia and mortality, even among the otherwise healthy. Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie cognitive aging is key to developing interventions to prevent or ameliorate cognitive decline. Disconnection theories of aging specifically implicate weakening of structural brain connectivity as a key mechanism of cognitive decline, but until recently, diffusion MRI data and connectomic methods needed to rigorously test such theories have been lacking. To expedite understanding how aging-related changes in the human structural connectome relate to aging-related cognitive declines, we will apply the latest connectomic and multivariate data analysis methods to existing data from two highly unique datasets: (1) The UK Biobank, a cross-sectional sample of ~10,000 40-75 year old adults, who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information; and (2) The Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936, a narrow-age cohort of older adults (baseline age = 73 years; N = 731) who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information on each of three separate occasions, each separated by three years. Using recently developed graph-theoretic models, we will construct structural brain connectome networks for each participant's diffusion MRI data at each wave and extract indices reflective of network topology within several specific networks of interest (NOIs) identified ex ante. We will also identify topologically central hub regions that disproportionately govern efficiency within each individual's connectome network. We will apply cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models to examine aging-related transformations in network indices, examine concurrent and longitudinal coupling between network indices and cognitive abilities, and test predictors of levels and changes in network indices and cognitive abilities. This will allow us to contrast the predictive utility of the selected NOIs for cognitive aging and to identify specific features of network architecture involved in cognitive aging and mediate the effects of demographic, medical, and lifestyle risk factors for cognitive aging. We additionally implement machine- learning methods to estimate an upper bound of prediction of cognitive aging from network indices, and identify novel features of network topology as candidate mechanisms of cognitive decline. The availability of two uniquely large and well-characterized datasets will allow us to ensure that findings are rigorous and reproducible using within sample (holdout) and between sample cross-validation. For all aims, we will place considerable emphasis on testing for incremental validity of network indices relative to both conventional structural neuroanatomical measures and topologically naïve summary indices of network integrity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie aging-related cognitive declines is key to developing interventions to improve both health and quality of life. This project will examine how changes in the structural connections between brain regions relate to changes in cognitive abilities over time and test hypothesized health, sociodemographic, and genetic predictors of such changes.",Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging,9925718,R01AG054628,"['3 year old', '3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Genetic', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Self Care', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'aged', 'biobank', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'feature selection', 'functional independence', 'genetic predictors', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'social', 'sociodemographic predictors', 'sociodemographics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2020,470535,0.024992028332895117
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Exploiting Voice Assistant Systems for Early Detection of Cognitive Decline Early detection of the cognitive decline involved in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD)  in older adults living alone is essential for developing, planning, and initiating interventions and support  systems to improve patients' everyday function and quality of life. Conventional, clinic-based methods for  early diagnosis are expensive, time-consuming, and impractical for large-scale screening. This project aims to develop a low-cost, passive, and practical home-based assessment method using Voice Assistant  Systems (VAS) for early detection of cognitive decline, including a set of novel data mining techniques for  sparse time-series speech. The project has three specific aims: 1. Using a recurrent neural network  (RNN) and a softmax regression model, we will develop a transfer learning technique to investigate the  link between the speech from in-lab VAS tasks and cognitive decline. The Pitt corpus from the  DementiaBank database will be used to optimize the RNN parameters and thereby overcome the limited  data problem of VAS. The softmax regression model will allow us to align the feature distributions from the  previous speech data and in-lab VAS speech. 2. We will develop a novel ""many-to-difference"" prediction  model with a symmetric RNN structure to predict the cognitive difference at two ends of a time period from  the sparse time-series data. The proposed model is different from previous ones as the learning focus is  shifted from the short-term pattern differences across users to the pattern difference over time for an  individual user. The proposed model accommodates well for the highly dynamic nature of the inputs and  maximally removes individual characteristics from the prediction result. To analyze the sparse time-series  speech, a new data sampling technique will be used to address the imbalanced data problem, and a data  quality metric will be developed for the proposed model. 3. The team will conduct an 18-month in-lab  evaluation and a 28-month in-home evaluation with a focus on whether the VAS tasks and features from  the in-lab evaluation and the repetition features of the in-home VAS data can measure and predict  cognitive decline in the in-home participants over time. The proposed methods will be integrated into an  interactive system to enable efficient communication on cognitive decline among patients, caregivers, and  clinicians. If successful, the outcomes of this project will provide an opportunity to provide supportive  evidence to clinicians for the early detection of cognitive impairment outside of a clinic-based setting. This project aims to develop a low-cost, passive, and practical cognitive assessment method using Voice  Assistant Systems (VAS) for early detection of cognitive decline. If successful, the proposed system may  be widely disseminated for the early diagnosis of cognitive impairment to complement existing diagnostic  modalities that could ultimately enable long-term patient and caregiver planning to maintain individual's  independence at home.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Exploiting Voice Assistant Systems for Early Detection of Cognitive Decline,10019452,R01AG067416,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'improved', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'recurrent neural network', 'screening']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS BOSTON,R01,2020,296138,-0.06913063496382736
"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood. This research will provide early life biomarkers that reconstruct prenatal exposures and predict childhood neurocognitive performance with the goal of developing novel and early-life interventions to protect children.",Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers,9882859,R01ES031259,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood specimen', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Neurotoxicity', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Consequentialism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expenditure', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Folic Acid', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vitamin B 12', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biomarker development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'early childhood', 'exposed human population', 'genome-wide', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'learning ability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'methylation biomarker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'routine screening', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,438331,-0.010712590304799614
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development,9893708,F31ES030263,"['Address', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Flame Retardants', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenols', 'Placenta', 'Plastics', 'Policy Maker', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'consumer product', 'data management', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fundamental research', 'health of the mother', 'high dimensionality', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple datasets', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'pollutant', 'polybrominated diphenyl ether', 'prenatal exposure', 'public health intervention', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2020,32095,0.07144809769537891
"The Impact of Air Pollution Exposure on COVID-19 Severity and Mortality PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently the most emergent public health disaster of the entire world. COVID-19 disproportionately affects older adults, people having history of smoking and comorbidities like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. There is no vaccine and treatment for COVID-19, therefore, public health interventions have been taken to control disease transmission. Also, searching modifiable environmental factors that can help reduce the COVID-19 severity and mortality is crucial. Air pollution exposure has been shown to have a systemic effect on the human body including lung function impairment and immune alterations. Recent two ecologic studies from Europe and the United States have suggested that higher long-term ambient air pollution exposure (PM2.5 and NO2) significantly contributes to the COVID-19 mortality. These findings from aggregated data of air pollution exposure and total number of deaths in large geographic areas need to be further verified by cohort study with individual data of air pollution exposure and COVID-19 case progression and mortality. Also, susceptibility factors such as low social economic status (SES), race/ethnicity, smoking exposures and comorbidities need to be accounted for in the analysis. To address the urgent public health question about the role of air pollution exposure in COVID-19 progression, we propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study based on the existing EMR data of all COVID- 19 cases (n>7000) diagnosed at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) medical centers. Specific aims of this proposal have been expanded from our ongoing NIEHS-supported R01 study investigating prenatal air pollution exposure and children's autism risk among 440,000 KPSC mother-child pairs (APAR study, 1R01ES029963). In this proposal, the main outcomes of interest are COVID-19 severity assessed by hospitalization, ICU admission and ventilator use, as well as death. Details dates will be available through EMR. Natural language processing technologies will be applied to identify the date of first COVID-19 symptom onset for each case. Thereafter, the earliest date among COVID-19 symptom onset and clinical diagnosis will be used as the study entry date. Then short- and long-term air pollution exposure will be estimated for each case by averaging air pollution exposure levels during one-month and one-year before the study entry date. Both ambient (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3) and traffic-related (line dispersion model estimated NOx) air pollution exposure will be assessed based on individual residential addresses. Detailed residential history of all KPSC members have been well-maintained by the KPSC system. Key covariates including age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking exposure, body mass index, comorbidities, medication use, and meteorological data will be extracted to control for confounding and identify susceptible high risk subgroups. With the unique cohort data resource and world-renowned epidemiologists and exposure scientists, this one-year study will greatly enhance our knowledge about the effect of air pollution exposure on COVID-19 progression and death. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study is proposed in response to the urgent need of large cohort studies investigating the contributions of environment such as air pollution exposure to the COVID-19 epidemic and mortality.

"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9981740,R01ES027747,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cadmium', 'Carbon', 'Carbon Black', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Membrane', 'Mercury', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Nitrates', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'RNA marker', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suggestion', 'Sulfate', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Trace Elements', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vesicle', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'ambient air pollution', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'extracellular vesicles', 'follow-up', 'inflammatory marker', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'modifiable risk', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'toxic metal']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2020,757233,0.01493177327539365
"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,9925813,K01HL141637,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perceived quality of life', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Professional Organizations', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'career', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health data', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'patient expectation', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'survivorship', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'working group']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,170750,0.00809193266084417
"Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study ABSTRACT When life stresses are especially intense, chronic, or overwhelming, deleterious health effects can occur, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, disability, depression, low quality of life, and dementia. In this context, resilience can be defined as the ability to maintain a healthy aging trajectory despite adverse conditions of stress. American Indians (AI) have a unique history and ongoing experience of trauma and disparities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions, which amplify daily stresses and contribute to health risks. Despite these adverse circumstances, remarkable resilience has been described in AI populations. Recent work by our group suggests that social support and alignment with Native culture correlate with lower levels of stress, negativity, anger, hostility, depression, mortality, and cardiovascular disease. However, our findings on cultural alignment are limited, and none has yet explored associations of resilience and social support. It remains an open question whether neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) can result from chronic stress, or whether individual psychosocial characteristics such as resilience can mediate such risk. We propose to address these knowledge gaps by efficiently leveraging an existing effort funded by the NHLBI in the Strong Heart Study, a longitudinal cohort of AI adults from 13 tribal communities across the US. The existing contract covers recruitment, consenting, and basic clinical examination of 3,000 eligible participants in 2022-2024; we propose to augment the limited protocol by administering additional psychosocial and neuropsychological instruments on resilience, social support, cultural identity and alignment, and cognition. Our Specific Aims are to: describe associations of individual resilience among AI adults with identity and self-regard, social support, and cultural alignment, by age and sex; evaluate resilience, social support, and cultural features in relation to ADRD; and use machine learning to develop explanatory models of resilience and dementia. Our study has the potential to advance epidemiologic knowledge of modifiable psychosocial conditions in a vulnerable, underserved population, and consequently to offer a clearer picture of the relative contributions of psychosocial, behavioral, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors related to ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic stress can result in negative health effects, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); American Indian (AI) populations have endured excess stresses and traumas, but have also shown remarkable psychosocial resilience, which may be related to robust social support, community environment, cultural identity. It is unclear which of these psychosocial features may be most predictive of psychosocial resilience in AI adults, or whether any is protective against neurodegeneration and ADRD. A search on NIH Reporter uncovered many projects focused on cognitive reserve—sometimes also called resilience—but none on psychosocial resilience or its related features as protective health characteristics in adult AIs. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap with novel data collection and analysis on trait-based psychosocial resilience, related features, cognitive function, and ADRD in 3000 adult AIs as part of the ongoing Strong Heart Study.","Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study",10126397,R01AG070822,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American Indians', 'Anger', 'Anthropology', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hostility', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Navajo', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Persons', 'Philosophy', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Spirituality', 'Stress', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Tribes', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'base', 'bullying', 'clinical examination', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohort', 'disability', 'eligible participant', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'instrument', 'intergenerational', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimism', 'practical application', 'psychosocial', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'trait', 'tribal community']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,521320,-0.016260299618120096
"Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study Project Summary Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the primary cause of death and a major cause of years of life lost in the US and in the world. Cohort studies conducted in North America and Europe have provided crucial information in identifying exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as a cause of increased CVD risks. They have also pointed out important directions for future research, including the differential toxicity of PM2.5 chemical constituents to CVD incidence, the shape of concentration-response (C-R) functions, impact of exposure time windows and indoor air pollution exposure. The objectives of our study are to assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and incident CVD, and investigate the impact of exposure time window and indoor air pollution on these associations. Approach. We will conduct a retrospective multi-cohort study in China using personal health records from five national cohorts with adjudicated CVD endpoints maintained by the Fuwai Hospital. To provide individual-level exposure trajectories for ~120,000 cohort participants during their follow-up period, we will develop an ensemble machine learning model using ground air quality measurements, satellite data, and air quality model simulations to generate 1 km resolution national PM2.5 mass and major constituent (sulfates, nitrates, elemental carbon, organic carbon, lead, and nickel) exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 1). Using cohort data from 2007 to 2020 for our main analyses, we will use Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the associations of long-term exposures to PM2.5 constituents and adverse cardiovascular outcomes including total CVD, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke (Aim 2). Variations of this model will be used to investigate the shape of the C-R functions (linear vs. non-linear) as well as the impact of exposure errors using exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 2a). We will also examine windows of susceptibility for CVD endpoints using both time-variant and time- invariant exposure metrics (Aim 2b). Finally, we will evaluate the confounding effect of indoor air pollution on the C-R functions using a sub-cohort with estimated personal PM2.5 exposure estimates based on Fuwai Hospital's ongoing Multi-Region Panel Study (Aim 2c). Expected Results. Given the tremendous variability in PM2.5 constituent concentrations in China over time and space, our findings will contribute new PM2.5 constituent-specific C-R functions in CVD burden calculation in both the US and the world. Our study will also expand our knowledge on important factors affecting these associations such as exposure window and indoor air pollution. Narrative This study will assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in a retrospective multi-cohort study. Usinig five national cohorts and multi-city indoor air pollution measurements in China, we will investigate the shape of the CVD concentration-response functions and the impacts of indoor air pollution and exposure windows. The findings of this study will provide additional scientific support for designing effective policy and public health actions to lower the CVD burden in both the US and China.",Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study,10034502,R01ES032140,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Caliber', 'Carbon', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Concentration measurement', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Outcome', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Heavy Metals', 'Hospitals', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meteorology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nickel', 'Nitrates', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Particulate Matter', 'Personal Health Records', 'Policies', 'Pollution', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Sulfate', 'Supercomputing', 'Tennessee', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urbanization', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'ambient air pollution', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'fine particles', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'land use', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'particle', 'response', 'study population', 'years of life lost']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,615182,0.04838275768876925
"Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status Abstract Exposures to extreme events are increasingly common in many parts of the globe as a function of changes in weather patterns combined with rising sea levels, but there is a paucity of data to support scientific research on the implications of such exposures for population health and well-being over the long-term. STAR, the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, is a unique exception. We have interviewed respondents from 10 months before the December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami for 10 years. This project will follow up the same respondents 15 years after the tsunami. The pre-tsunami baseline is a population-representative survey of 27,000 individuals who were living along the coast of Aceh and North Sumatra, Indonesia. The tsunami constitutes a large-scale, unanticipated natural disaster in an area that was not thought to be prone to tsunamis. Moreover, its impacts were spatially idiosyncratic across the study area. Whether a particular community was inundated by the waves depended on a combination of the wave direction, seabed and shoreline topography. Of 368 baseline communities, about a fifth were devastated, a third were somewhat damaged and the rest were not directly affected. These features of the natural experiment provide the basis for identifying causal impacts of this major natural disaster which killed 170,000 people in the study area. The baseline and six post-tsunami waves collected during the prior phase of this project provide detailed information about exposure to and experience of the disaster and the evolution of health and wellbeing, broadly defined, for baseline respondents who survived the tsunami plus new household members. In each follow-up, we have interviewed 95% of all baseline survivors. In this continuation we will re-interview all baseline survivors and their household members fifteen years after the tsunami. We will place these data in the public domain, adding to prior waves of STAR already in the public domain to create an unparalleled data resource for the scientific community. Focusing on those who were exposed to the tsunami as children (age <12y and in utero at the time), we will investigate the impacts of tsunami exposure on the evolution of health, education and cognitive performance, linking outcomes to changes in material and psycho-social resources at the family level as well as community level resources. The latter will be measured combining administrative data and information extracted from satellite imagery using machine learning. Longer-term impacts, fifteen years after the tsunami, will exploit innovative human capital measures including biomarkers, executive function and emotional reactivity. Loss of one or both parents is among the most extreme exposures. We will explore the causal effects of orphanhood by comparing children who lost parents in the tsunami with those in the same community who did not. Project Narrative This project will field the fifteen year follow up of the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery (STAR), a large-scale longitudinal study of individuals differentially exposed to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The data provide unique information on the evolution of population health of a group of 27,000 individuals first interviewed before the tsunami, including biomarker measurements and integrated information on environmental change.",Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status,10052164,R01HD052762,"['Adolescence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Child Welfare', 'Cicatrix', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Data', 'Disasters', 'Documentation', 'Earthquakes', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Health education', 'Height', 'Heterogeneity', 'Household', 'Imagery', 'Indian Ocean', 'Individual', 'Indonesia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Natural Disasters', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Public Domains', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Rest', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Shock', 'Siblings', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'Sumatra', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Time', 'Tsunami', 'Variant', 'Water', 'acetone hydrazone', 'adverse childhood events', 'behavioral response', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'environmental change', 'executive function', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health economics', 'human capital', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'member', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'reconstruction', 'resilience', 'sea level rise', 'success', 'tool', 'weather patterns', 'young adult']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,544239,0.004455996924003695
"Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL—PROJECT SUMMARY Healthspan is a complex trait, influenced by many interacting polymorphic alleles and environmental factors that may accelerate or delay aging, reduce or increase disease risk, and/or promote extended lifespan. Thus, assessing the role of genetic variation in aging requires an experimental strategy capable of modeling the genetic and biological complexity of human populations while allowing for efficient identification and validation of candidate genes. With this proposal, the JAX NSC seeks support to further develop and disseminate the next generation of genetic, phenotyping, and information resources necessary to enable a systems-wide approach to understanding healthy aging. Over the past 15 years, The JAX NSC has transformed aging research both at JAX and across the geroscience community, providing central resources to support investigators that have resulted in 26 peer-reviewed publications in the last funding period. The Center has developed nascent regional and national resources for aging research, including aging mouse resources and tissues that support our numerous collaborations and external researchers. All JAX NSC data and tools are publicly disseminated on the Mouse Phenome Database and the JAX NSC website, thus ensuring that the resources generated and expertise acquired through the Center is readily available to the aging research community. In this renewal, we will advance towards our goal by providing unique resources, tools, and support to geroscience investigators while leveraging JAX's unparalleled expertise in the large-scale identification and functional validation of complex polygenic traits in mice. We will do this by providing effective Center administration and enhancing the utility of JAX NSC resources throughout the aging community (Aim 1); expanding the research focus on aging, healthspan and age-related diseases through a robust Research Development Core (Aim 2); increasing the diversity of mouse resources available for aging research, including a new study to, for the first time, investigate the effect of genetic variation on cellular senescence and treatment with senolytic drugs (Aim 3); strengthening the data and computational and support available to the aging community (Aim 4); expanding the use of machine learning technologies in interpretation of aging pathologies (Aim 5). The Center will be led by a highly experienced team of Principal Investigators and Core Leaders who, with oversight from an External Advisory Board, will provide effective management to facilitate the goals and objectives of the Center. The Center will leverage unparalleled institutional resources, facilities and expertise of The Jackson Laboratory, a globally renowned institution for mouse genetics research, to enhance its goals and the utility of the resources it generates for the aging research community. OVERALL—PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Human aging is influenced by genetic factors, whereby differences in longevity as well as changes in health and disease risk with time are linked to variation in individuals' genetic codes. The Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center will develop resources to encourage the use of a wider range of mouse models in aging research. Resources—including aged mouse models that mirror human genetic variation, metabolic and microbiome data, and methods to reveal genetic factors tied to human aging—will be available to the scientific community, accelerating research to understand and ultimately prolong healthy human aging.",Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging,10045024,P30AG038070,"['Advisory Committees', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biology of Aging', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Aging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Variation', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Image Analysis', 'Inbred Strain', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Pathology', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shock', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'age related', 'aged', 'animal tissue', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'candidate validation', 'career development', 'data dissemination', 'data management', 'data tools', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'healthspan', 'healthy aging', 'insight', 'microbiome', 'mouse genetics', 'mouse model', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'response', 'senescence', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIA,JACKSON LABORATORY,P30,2020,1069526,0.017568888717596258
"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,10238415,R00ES028743,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Wind', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'indexing', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R00,2020,248998,0.03510239468074982
"Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater Project Summary / Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a naturally-occurring metal contaminant found in water supplies throughout the world. Although research using small samples (< 400 observations) from Bangladesh, China and Canada suggests that excessive consumption of Mn is neurotoxic in infants and young children, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) classifies Mn only as a secondary contaminant. Thus, Mn is not subject to mandatory monitoring in public water systems, let alone private wells, which serve over 2 million Californians while remaining unregulated and untreated. To reconcile the gap between epidemiological evidence and regulatory action, we propose this timely research. Our project, which takes California’s private wells as a focal point for its investigation, has three specific aims: to identify (1) areas at high risk of exposure to Mn in drinking water (2) the socioeconomic characteristics of communities at high-risk of Mn exposure, and (3) the degree of association between Mn exposure and the health outcomes of infants and young children. While treatment for Mn-contaminated water is technologically straightforward, access may depend on a community’s socioeconomic and political status; thus, there is danger of Mn silently amplifying health inequalities. The ​broader, long-term objectives of this research are (I) to encourage further analyses of Mn exposure in California by developing a statewide publicly-available dataset from groundwater Mn data, and (II) to develop a ​causal ​framework for a primary-sample study of Mn effects on infant and child health. California enforces the US EPA’s secondary contaminant standard of 50 µg L​-1 but only in community water systems. Non-transient, non-community water systems (e.g. schools and hospitals) and private wells are exempt. In recent years, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has found Mn concentrations above the health-based target of 300 µg L​-1 in California’s wells. ​The proposed research will indicate whether and to what extent Mn affects child health and contributes to health disparities. As such, it is aligned with the NIEHS mission to determine how environmental exposures affect humans in order to promote healthier lives. To achieve the first aim of identifying areas at high risk of exposure to unsafe concentrations of Mn, we will use a machine learning model on subsurface flow and groundwater chemistry to predict Mn concentrations in the Central Valley, Los Angeles, Central Coast and West Coast Basins; then, we will overlay the Mn prediction grid with ZIP code and school district polygons to identify the areas that emerge with more than a 50% chance of exposure to Mn at the secondary standard as high-risk. For the second aim, we will determine if high-risk areas are distinguished from low-risk areas by their socioeconomic status and demographics using two-sample t-tests. For the third aim, we will run least squares regressions of birth weight, grade-by-school test scores and chronic absenteeism rates on predicted Mn exposure with controls for chemical confounds, socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics. Project Narrative The impact of manganese (Mn) on population health is an under-investigated problem in the United States relative to the wide prevalence and frequent detections of the chemical above safe concentrations in groundwater basins throughout the country. In line with NIEHS priorities to better understand environmental health disparities and to aid in securing environmental justice, we propose to correct this knowledge gap by undertaking a substantial investigation into the prevalence of Mn in California’s private wells, and examining the shared characteristics of communities most likely to be exposed to unsafe levels of manganese in drinking water. By also performing a preliminary investigation of the relationship between Mn exposure and child cognitive health, our study will provide an initial assessment of the public health threat from Mn, highlight the most vulnerable communities, and inform regulatory agencies seeking to review drinking water standards for Mn.",Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater,9978510,R21ES030807,"['Absenteeism', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Bangladesh', 'Birth Weight', 'California', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'China', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disadvantaged', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Esthetics', 'Exposure to', 'Geological Survey', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impaired health', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Micronutrients', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Vital Statistics', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'base', 'contaminated water', 'demographics', 'drinking water', 'econometrics', 'elementary school', 'environmental justice', 'ethnic minority population', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'ground water', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'infant outcome', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'school district', 'socioeconomics', 'web site']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,R21,2020,224680,0.028334605287822983
"CHABMAP (Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom Mapping and Analyses Platform) technology automates the quantification of toxic CyanoHABs exposure epochs for any waterbody. Specific Aim #1: Operationalize spatio-temporal CyanoHAB exposure epoch metrics  • Fuse multi-scale and disparate satellite remote sensing platforms and automate retrievals over  space and time to derive CyanoHAB exposure metrics. We will build enterprise software to fully  automate the harmonization and fusion of NASA’s Landsat-8 OLI and ESA’s Sentinel-2 and  Sentinel-3 satellite platforms to provide long-term (1984-present) moderate spatial resolution  (30meter pixels) and high temporal frequency CyanoHAB exposure metrics (Cyanobacteria  Intensity, Color Dissolved Organic Matter, Total Suspended Solids, Floating Algae Index,  Chlorophyll-a Concentration, & toxins). The decision support tool automates epoch synthesis to  understand incubation periods and exposure triggers for neurodegenerative diseases. Specific Aim #2: Scale on-demand CHABMAP commercial product services  • Scale and implement CHABMAP data services for infinite scalability using BigData cloud  technologies. This Aim involves three main development efforts: adapting our proprietary  Geospatial Image and Processing System (GIPS) capabilities to an AWS-deployable auto-scaling  cluster, creation of user interfaces and application programming interfaces (APIs) to interact with  these services, and enhancements to the base GIPS framework to facilitate intercommunication  between remote GIPS-enabled archives and the cloud processing streams. This includes the  creation of deployable compute instances, optimization of computation and parallelization  specific to AWS deployment, optimization of temporary and long-term storage of intermediate  products, and optimization of communication and data transfer with end users. Ultimately, this  Aim will allow for the assessment and monitoring of CyanoHAB conditions for any waterbody or  region (i.e., North America) on the planet. Specific Aim #3: Execute risk assessment frameworks with public health partners  • We will work in partnership with Cleveland Clinic, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center,  University of Miami, Macquarie University, NIH’s Neuromuscular Diseases Research Section and  CDC’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (National ALS Registry) to assess the role  of CyanoHABs exposure as a risk factor for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using patients,  clinic-, and population-based controls across diverse settings and geographies. Each application  end user has ongoing risk assessment frameworks (i.e., Gene-Environment, Residential History  Machine Learning, eco-epidemiological, molecular biology) which our CHABMAP technology will  integrate exposure epoch metrics to understand the etiology or ALS and support drug discovery. Proposed Innovation CHABMAP technology automates the quantification of toxic Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom (CHAB) exposure epochs for any waterbody or catchment in the world for the past four decades using multi-scale harmonized satellites.

"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychopathology arising from a disruption of emotional function affects over 400 million people globally, yet we lack a neurobiological model to guide classification and treatment.

"Concussion and Driving Skills in the Young Driver PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research Objectives. This prospective cohort study rigorously examines the neurocognitive impact of concussion on simulated and real-world driving performance among young drivers aged 16-24 years. Importance. Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving. Unlike new “Return to Learn” guidelines, there are no evidence-based “Return to Drive” guidelines for when individuals with concussion may be safe to return to driving. Objectives. Conduct a prospective matched cohort study to explore the risk of concussion in simulated and real-world driving conditions. We propose three specific aims and a fourth exploratory aim:  (i) Examine whether concussion negatively impacts simulated driving performance among young  drivers, relative to a cohort of young drivers without concussion.  (ii) Determine whether simulated driving task performance correlates with recovery from  concussion symptoms and signs in the month following concussion, relative to young drivers  without recent concussion.  (iii) Measure the impact of concussion and recovery on real-world driving exposure and performance.  (iv) [Exploratory] Examine whether concussion symptoms and neuropsychometric impairment are  associated with higher rates of driving citations or reported crashes. Study design. Prospective controlled matched cohort study. Setting/participants. 50 drivers with recent concussion; 50 age/gender matched controls aged 16-25 years. Study protocol. Concussion participants will be recruited within two weeks of concussion. Case and control participants will complete 1) driving risk survey; 2) neuropsychological testing an 3) simulated driving tasks at baseline and 1 month. Commercially available monitoring technology will record risky driving for 3 months Outcome measures. (i) simulated driving risk scores; (ii) real world driving risk scores (rapid braking, rapid acceleration, speeding); (iii) reported citations and crash rates. Impact. This study will have a significant population health impact in elucidating the neurocognitive sequelae of recent concussion on driving. Results will inform return to safe driving among young drivers with concussion. PROJECT NARRATIVE Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving.

"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention,9991720,R01AG063887,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrophic', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'black/white disparity', 'brain health', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcification', 'critical period', 'dementia risk', 'early life exposure', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fasting glucose', 'heart function', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'treatment strategy', 'trend', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2020,755657,0.0039763170691683464
"Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) PROJECT SUMMARY Evidence suggests that exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), including preterm birth (PTB). Rates of PTB and infant mortality in Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest of all US states and territories. There are 18 Superfund sites in PR, and evidence of contamination of the drinking water is extensive. Moreover, extreme weather events (hurricanes, flooding) may result in elevated exposures to Superfund chemicals. The PROTECT center has brought together researchers from Northeastern University, the University of Puerto Rico, University of Georgia, and the University of Michigan to provide much needed understanding of the relationship and the mechanisms by which exposure to suspect chemicals contribute to APOs, and to develop new methods to reduce risk of exposure in PR and beyond. To do this, PROTECT uses a source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological (Project 1), toxicological (Project 2), fate and transport (Project 3), and remediation (Project 4) studies, a unified sampling infrastructure, a centralized indexed data repository, and a sophisticated data management system. Since its inception in 2010, PROTECT has built detailed and extensive data sets on environmental conditions and prenatal conditions of 1457 pregnant mothers (exposure, socioeconomic and health data–close to 3000 data points per participant), yielding a cohort of 1210 live births in northern PR. In the renewal, PROTECT will recruit and follow an additional 1000 study participants, yielding a cohort of 800+ live births for an ultimate total cohort of 2000+ completed live births. PROTECT has documented significant contamination of northern PR drinking water and has found compelling preliminary epidemiologic and mechanistic toxicology associations between Superfund chemicals and APOs. PROTECT research has focused on chlorinated volatile organic compounds and phthalates and their role in PTB. The PROTECT renewal will broaden its scope, employing a data-driven approach to study and reduce the impact of exposure to mixtures of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites in karst regions on APOs in Puerto Rico’s underserved, highly-exposed population. Target chemicals will be expanded to include metals, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We will investigate the impacts of extreme weather events on contaminant transport and exposure, and new water treatment technologies will be developed for portable and robust water treatment systems. The PROTECT renewal will also focus on oxidative stress as an underlying biological pathway by which contaminant exposure can lead to APOs. New statistical methods and data mining, machine learning, and visualization tools will be developed to allow PROTECT researchers to analyze our datasets. PROTECT will employ innovative approaches to engage and educate the community, involve study participants, report- back data, and communicate with stakeholders. A broad suite of training and professional activities will be provided to trainees, individually tailored to the trainees’ needs and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Reproductive health has been at the forefront of Puerto Ricans’ health concerns as rates of preterm birth and infant mortality in Puerto Rico are among the highest of all U.S. states and territories. The PROTECT SRC is exploring the link between exposure to a mixture of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Puerto Rico, and is working to reduce that exposure. Improved understanding of the link between adverse pregnancy outcomes and contamination, together with developing sustainable technologies to reduce risk, will help improve health outcomes in Puerto Rico (a disadvantaged population) and beyond.",Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT),9839906,P42ES017198,"['Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Floods', 'Geographic state', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Hurricane', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infrastructure', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxidative Stress Pathway', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pesticides', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Public Health Practice', 'Puerto Rican', 'Puerto Rico', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Superfund', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Water', 'Water Purification', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'community involvement', 'contaminant transport', 'contaminated drinking water', 'contaminated water', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'disadvantaged population', 'drinking water', 'experience', 'extreme weather', 'ground water', 'health data', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'new technology', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'portability', 'prenatal', 'recruit', 'remediation', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'sound', 'superfund chemical', 'superfund site', 'tissue culture', 'toxicant', 'volatile organic compound', 'water treatment']",NIEHS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,P42,2020,2414074,0.032820968658156494
"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes. This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction learning.",Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory,9904774,K23MH113708,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Dorsal', 'Exposure to', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Severities', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'statistics', 'theories', 'treatment of anxiety disorders']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,186408,0.031133457403039674
"Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) Project Abstract  Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of over 5000 man-made chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment, due to their chemical stability and bioaccumulative properties. Many of these “forever chemicals” have been linked with health concerns, including strong evidence of developmental health and harm to hormone-sensitive tissues. Manufacturers continue to substitute new PFAS for which exposure- based health risks are unknown. There is an urgent public health need to determine the effects of PFAS in use on both mammary gland development and increased breast cancer incidence. Current exposure studies use rodent models that require cumbersome end-point analyses as well as large monetary and time investments.  Our proposal is aimed at developing an in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) pipeline of mammary gland development and maintenance to identify and prioritize potentially toxic PFAS, to ultimately mitigate number of animals needed for environmental exposure studies. Our approach is to develop in vitro models of the mammary gland of increasing complexity but decreasing throughput, identifying links between high-throughput and high- complexity model endpoint readouts to best prioritize large chemical libraries. A key technology to establish links across multiple in vitro culture platforms is optical coherence tomography-based structural-functional imaging (OCT-SFI), developed by MPI Oldenburg, which non-invasively visualizes label-free cells, their intracellular motility, and morphology of formed spheroids, within optically turbid tissue models.  Our first specific aim advances a high-throughput paper-based culture system, developed by MPI Lockett, to study mammary epithelial cell invasion in physiologically relevant tissue microenvironments. The platform will evaluate 96 different exposure conditions in parallel. Our second specific aim employs 3D co-culture models that include fibroblasts to model stromal signaling known to affect mammary gland development. OCT-SFI will provide cellular motility and morphology of the organotypic spheroids that form in these cultures. Finally, our third aim will screen a library of 40 PFAS, with a particular focus on the perfluoroethercarboxylic acids (PFECAs) currently used in industrial coatings. In addition, 12 PFAS will be screened for which there is existing in vivo rodent model data available, and comparisons between in vitro assay outputs and in vivo gland remodeling will be used to refine the assay models and establish initial thresholds for screening.  The models developed as part of this proposal will thus be predictive of biology, enabling the high-throughput capability needed for future screening of all PFAS as well as other emerging endocrine disruptors. The project’s risk is balanced by the known imaging capabilities of OCT-SFI to probe responses in 3D spheroid and paper- based co-cultures. The high-throughput nature of this IVIVE pipeline makes it ideal for screening libraries of potential toxicants, providing information-rich datasets of spatially and temporally resolved morphological and molecular changes across the tissue-like structures. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a pipeline to screen and prioritize libraries of potentially toxic man-made chemicals found in the environment for further analyses, with particular emphasis on per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) of which there are over 5000 currently known. Current environmental exposure testing methods evaluate mammary gland development in live mice because the mammary gland is highly susceptible to chemical exposure; yet, such methods are slow and expensive. Our proposal uses mammary cell culture models in increasingly complex, tissue-like environments, in combination with high-speed 3D optical imaging techniques, and ultimately compare the platform with a few candidate PFAS against existing data in live mice, setting the stage for future high-throughput screening of potential environmental toxicants.",Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),10152786,R01ES032730,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Breast Cancer Epidemiology', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Fibroblasts', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gland', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hormones', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Investments', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary gland', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mesenchymal', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nature', 'North Carolina', 'Odds Ratio', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Physiological', 'Poly-fluoroalkyl substances', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Scanning', 'Scoring Method', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'carcinogenicity', 'cell motility', 'chemical stability', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging capabilities', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'intercellular communication', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant phenotype', 'mammary epithelium', 'mammary gland development', 'man', 'model design', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'premalignant', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,559511,0.012690860383201998
"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,9906155,R01AG059729,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caucasians', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Diet', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Freedom', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature aging syndrome', 'Preparation', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'ST14 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'biracial', 'caucasian American', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'disability', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fitness', 'healthy aging', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'male', 'mental state', 'microbial', 'middle age', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sarcopenia', 'walking speed', 'young adult']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,611864,-0.02034090068024027
"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework,9894798,R00ES027511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'African American', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Future', 'GALA', 'Genetic', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Puerto Rican', 'Randomized', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'analog', 'base', 'career', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'exposure pathway', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'minority children', 'pollutant', 'public health intervention', 'pulmonary function', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social disparities', 'social epidemiology', 'social factors', 'social vulnerability', 'tool']",NIEHS,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,249000,-0.0200289904069434
"Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders Project Summary: Early life psychosocial adversity and stress are well-established as the most powerful environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes in children. Impairments in developing emotion regulation and cognitive control and associated alterations in brain development have been shown to mediate the effects of adversity on risk for the development of psychopathology. Early psychosocial adversity impacts the epigenetic and inflammation-mediated processes that contribute to these negative outcomes, a process known as “biological embedding of stress.” While this risk trajectory has been clearly linked to increased rates of psychopathology, the mechanisms of this process, its targetable mediators and how early in development they operate are yet to be determined. Here we focus on the effects of early life adversity on brain, emotion regulation and cognitive control outcomes relevant to risk for mental disorders, beginning antenatally and extending to age 3. We will examine the role of pre- and postnatal adversity/stress, the maternal and child perinatal gut microbiome and early caregiver support on these key neurodevelopmental outcomes utilizing state-of-the-art neuroimaging. Our unifying hypothesis is that these factors modulate systemic inflammatory responses, induce neuronal effects through this and other processes that adversely impact brain development in limbic and cortical regions, and mediate the effects of early adversity on child emotion regulation, cognitive control and mental health outcomes. These factors will be studied in a unique, prospectively ascertained cohort of 370 mothers and their offspring at high psychosocial risk being recruited as part of an already funded March of Dimes project at Washington University. The cohort will include both term- and prematurely-born infants and toddlers given the increased risk of psychosocial adversity and aberrant gut microbiome in preterm children. The offspring will be intensively prospectively studied from the 1st trimester to age 3, providing a unique dataset in which to examine the interrelationships among pre- and postnatal adversity, biomarkers of inflammation, the gut microbiome and developmental and mental health outcomes. The perinatal and early childhood periods are critical times to study these exposures as adverse neurodevelopment associated with adversity begins in utero through fetal programming. Likewise, the perinatal period is a critical developmental window for microbial influences, when gut microbial colonization has its most enduring effects. The proposed study merges established research groups in these areas in a center with advanced infant and childhood neuroimaging and extensive microbiome expertise, and offers an unprecedented opportunity to understand the mechanisms of the biological embedding of adversity on brain, cognitive and emotional trajectories in a high-risk cohort. We will also apply innovative computational methods, using Deep Learning, to extend understanding of these data. Findings will provide critical and novel insights to inform early preventive interventions relevant to emotional, cognitive and mental health outcomes for children at greatest risk. Project Narrative This study will investigate the mechanisms by which psychosocial adversity experienced in utero and early in life impact the child’s brain, cognitive and emotional development, testing the hypothesis that stress and adversity during pregnancy adversely affect early brain development through inflammatory mechanisms. Another important focus of this project is to examine how the maternal perinatal microbiome and infant’s gut microbiome during early childhood impact brain development, either through the infant’s inflammatory response or other effects. A third focus is to explore the effects of caregiver support on this risk trajectory, testing the idea that high caregiver support reduces the negative influences of early adversity, altered immune biomarkers and disruptions in the gut microbiome.","Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders",9929031,R01MH113883,"['3 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caregiver support', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Funding', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informal Social Control', 'Instruction', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mothers', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Poverty', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'antenatal', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'gray matter', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiome', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal period', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,2343175,-0.005704441230057973
"Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging. Age-related cognitive decline is a problem of growing importance given the trend toward increased lifespan and the importance of cognitive function in determining risk for neurodegenerative disease. Despite the importance of this problem, the cognitive and molecular changes that mediate it are still poorly understood. While there are competing theories for the mediators of cognitive aging at both psychological and molecular levels, theories on aging and the research supporting them have typically focused on a single level of analysis. As our understanding of the biological basis for behavior grows, this divide becomes less sensible. Instead, psychological theory should be constrained according to its known biology, and biology should in turn inform psychological theory. Here I propose to learn neural network modeling and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in order to bridge human psychological theory that has been the focus of my recent work to the molecular level theory that was the focus of my post-baccalaureate training at the NIA. I will build from my recent work that highlights a key statistical problem faced by the brain: how to selectively pool information across relevant sources but partition information across irrelevant ones. I will closely examine the cognitive and molecular mechanisms that allow for efficient pooling and partitioning to test the overarching theory that, due to impaired glutamate and dopamine signaling, older adults develop a selective deficit in pooling relevant sources of information. I will test this theory in two separate paradigms: visual working memory (K99) and learning and perceptual inference (R00). During the K99 phase of the award I will examine how pooling information from visual targets with similar features can 1) improve effective memory capacity, 2) be achieved by a neural network model, and 3) be impaired by simulated molecular deficiencies (glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine). This bridge between cognitive and molecular levels of analysis will be used to test whether age-related memory deficits are due to inefficient pooling and mediated by molecular deficits in glutamate and dopamine (as measured through MRS and behavioral proxy, respectively). During the R00 phase of the award I will use the training in neural networks and MRS provided in the K99 phase to examine how 1) pooling sequential pieces of information affects learning and perceptual bias, 2) efficient pooling and partitioning can be achieved by a neural network model and 3) these processes are disrupted by specific molecular deficiencies. The established relationships between statistical properties (sequential pooling and partitioning), psychological measurements (learning and perceptual bias) and molecular factors (glutamate, dopamine, and norepinephrine signaling levels) will be used to test whether age-related differences in learning and perceptual bias reflect deficient pooling mediated by local glutamate deficiency (as measured through MRS). Overall, this work will contribute a deeper and more detailed understanding of the psychological and molecular factors that interact to mediate age-related cognitive decline. In addition, the K99 training will provide me the tools necessary to link psychological and molecular levels of analysis and the R00 phase will build the foundations of my independent research laboratory allowing me to develop a successful scientific career driven by experiments that build and refine a unified understanding of cognitive aging. Project Narrative This project will explore how changes to basic information processing in the brain occurring over the course of healthy aging may contribute to age-related deficits in learning and memory. The work will also examine the biological underpinnings of these changes and may inform future research into interventions that could slow the cognitive aging process.",Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging.,10005106,R00AG054732,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Arousal', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Comparative Study', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Dopamine', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Foundations', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Norepinephrine', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Psychological Theory', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'comparative', 'emerging adult', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'information processing', 'lens', 'neural network', 'psychobiology', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'visual information', 'young adult']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,248038,0.005520518927943531
"A preconception cohort study of environmental chemicals, fertility, and miscarriage ABSTRACT Infertility and spontaneous abortion (SAB) are significant public health problems, affecting up to 25% of reproductive age couples in the United States. Health care costs attributable to infertility and SAB exceed $5 billion per year, and several studies have shown an association between infertility treatments and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors for subfertility and SAB is an important public health goal. The potential effects of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on risk of subfertility and SAB are understudied. The few existing human studies have limitations including small sample size, enrollment after conception, retrospective study design, suboptimal assessment of exposure and outcome, inadequate control for potential confounding variables, and limited generalizability. The proposed study will prospectively assess the relation of exposure to selected EDCs, including phenols, phthalates, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), to risk of subfertility and SAB in a preconception subcohort of 950 pregnancy planners. We will use data from two NICHD-supported prospective cohorts of pregnancy planners in North America and Denmark. With web-based recruitment and data collection, we have enrolled over 17,000 women attempting pregnancy into these cohorts. In a subset of 200 participants, we have successfully pilot tested in-person collection of urine and blood specimens during the preconception and early pregnancy periods. In this application, we propose to expand in-person biospecimen collection, increasing the number of women with preconception and early pregnancy urine and blood samples from 200 to 950. At each of our three biospecimen collection sites (Boston, Detroit, and Aarhus), we will enroll 250 women and collect three urine samples and one blood sample (in preconception) and three urine samples and one blood sample (in early pregnancy). We will ship the samples to the CDC for the analysis of urinary phthalates, urinary phenols, and serum PFAS. To increase cost efficiency, we will pool three urine samples in each exposure window before assaying for phthalates and phenols; and we will assay one preconception blood specimen for PFAS, a persistent chemical, in analyses of subfertility and SAB. Finally, we will conduct a pilot study among 100 U.S. participants to assess the feasibility of collecting urine by mail, which would allow us to take advantage of our full geographically-diverse cohort in the future. Strengths of this application include the prospective design, preconception enrollment of pregnancy planners, repeated measurement of exposure during preconception and early pregnancy, excellent control for confounding via bimonthly prospective data collection on a wide range of covariates, and use of the latest analytic methods for mixtures modeling. We have generated compelling preliminary data to support our aims. The present grant is cost-effective in leveraging already-established cohort studies with data collection and follow-up supported by other grants. The results generated will be translatable by directly informing future regulatory decisions about EDC standards in a manner that could reduce rates of infertility and SAB. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nearly 15% of all couples have difficulty becoming pregnant and up to 25% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. Infertility and miscarriage can cause profound psychological and financial hardship for those affected, and they account for more than 5 billion dollars in U.S. health care costs each year.

"A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research Summary/Abstract This project will construct a Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (IPUMS-MLP) of unprecedented scale and scope. Using cutting-edge automatic record linkage technology and drawing on complete count U.S. census data available from IPUMS for the period 1850 to 1940, the project will construct millions of individual life histories and trace millions of families over multiple generations. This infrastructure will provide the most comprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will transform our understanding of processes of population aging. The work will require significant innovation and new technical infrastructure to accommodate the massive scale of the database. These data will allow investigators to directly observe changes in aging processes and life-course transitions during the period in which U.S. society was being transformed by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, demographic transition, and economic collapse. Investigators will be able to follow individuals over time to evaluate the impact of early-life conditions on later outcomes, trace life-course transitions into adulthood and old age, and observe family change over multiple generations. IPUMS-MLP will enrich existing aging surveys by providing data on multiple generations of forebears of survey respondents; likewise, it will enrich existing historical databases by enabling them to connect with descendants across multiple generations. Leveraging billions of dollars of federal investments in census data and transactional records from a variety of administrative sources, this project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. Project Narrative The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in health and well-being of the older population and will support research on the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. For example, the data will enable examinations of the impact of lead exposure to late onset Alzheimer’s disease, the socioeconomic and health effects of early-life income support, intergenerational transmission of health and wellbeing over multiple generations, and the impact of early-life cognitive capacity on later-life health and economic outcomes.",A Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel for Aging Research,9984216,R01AG057679,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Big Data', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Demographic Transitions', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Genealogy', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immigration', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Mission', 'Names', 'Neighborhoods', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Process', 'Process', 'Public Policy', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Social Processes', 'Social Security', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Urbanization', 'War', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive capacity', 'cost effective', 'data curation', 'data integration', 'data quality', 'economic outcome', 'experience', 'health economics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'lead exposure', 'life history', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'structured data', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,675029,0.0226389177247147
"Guiding next steps for SPRINT-MIND implementation: Identifying high-benefit subgroups and comparative effects of ARB- vs. ACEI-based regimens PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are the leading cause of dependence and disability in the elderly population worldwide, costing the US healthcare system over $200 billion annually. Because ADRD represents a continuous irreversible physical and cognitive decline, identifying effective approaches for its prevention is imperative. Hypertension, particularly in midlife, is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and ADRD. Recent data from the randomized Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) Intervention Trial (SPRINT) Memory and cognition IN Decreased hypertension (SPRINT MIND) demonstrated that intensive SBP control (<120 mmHg) reduced the combined incidence of adjudicated mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and probable dementia, as well as abnormal white matter lesion (WML) volume compared to standard BP control (<140 mmHg) over five years follow up. To maximize public health impact, it is critical to identify which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive SBP treatment and if cognitive benefits were due to direct effects of specific antihypertensive medications on cognition independent of, or in addition to, their BP-lowering effect. Prior animal and human studies, as well as our preliminary data, suggest that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) have greater effects on cognition than angiotensin-converting- enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). If verified, this finding would be significant since ARBs and ACEIs are currently among the medications most commonly prescribed to older adults and are thought to be equivalent in benefit and safety. Our objective is to answer remaining questions of how to safely implement SPRINT in older patients most likely to derive cognitive benefits from intensive SBP treatment. With its large sample size, 5 years follow-up, and high-quality repeated measures of rigorously adjudicated cognitive outcomes, brain imaging, and antihypertensive medication use, SPRINT MIND provides a unique, cost-efficient, and ideal setting to answer these questions. We aim to: (1) develop and validate a prediction tool that quantifies patients’ expected cognitive benefits and net (overall) benefit incorporating cognitive and cardiovascular benefit and risk of SAEs under intensive SBP treatment, and (2) determine comparative effects, including dose-response, of ARB- vs. ACEI-based antihypertensive medication regimens on cognitive and brain structure outcomes independent of SBP-lowering effects. Though SPRINT MIND is among the first randomized trials to demonstrate a beneficial preventive effect on cognition, it is uncertain how SPRINT-MIND should be implemented and in which patients. Successful completion of this project will guide next steps for implementation by determining: (1) which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive SBP treatment and (2) if ARBs have greater beneficial effects on cognitive outcomes and WML volume than ACEIs, independent of their similar SBP lowering effects.

"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Many older adults experience declines in cognitive ability that can be substantial, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Population aging, coupled with age-related cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, represents an unprecedented challenge. Early detection of cognitive impairment is a crucial goal. This would allow individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment and/or AD/ADRD to adopt lifestyle changes to minimize decrements and the risk for acquired cognitive impairment. However, the massive potential of cognitive training and longitudinal assessment to detect and prevent age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are unlikely to be realized unless individuals are willing and able to engage with these protocols for an extended period of time. Adherence to cognitive assessment and training is often poor. Addressing the gap between potential and realized benefits of early detection and prevention of cognitive impairment is an urgent goal as the population ages. The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia by 1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols, 2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence, and 3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures. Projects aim to investigate these issues within samples of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials will test an adaptive, tailored, and integrated technology support system predicted to boost adherence to cognitive protocols, over and above a simpler scheduling and reminder system over 6 months. Studies will provide valuable and generalizable insight into not only the benefits of adherence support, but also the individual difference factors that shape protocol adherence (e.g., attitudes, cognitive ability, dementia status, health status, personality, technology proficiency). Data will inform the process of identifying individuals who would benefit from additional support, and predicting and preventing extended adherence failures before they happen. By increasing adherence, these studies will help improve early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, which will ultimately extend older adults' functional independence, improving their lives and the lives of their families, and reducing care and support resources needed to address lost independence like that associated with Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Further, intervention studies for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can be made more efficient through tools for identifying individuals likely to experience decline before substantial cognitive impairment has occurred. Results have implications that extend far beyond cognitive impairment; the methods and mechanisms uncovered have broad implications for technology-mediated assessment and protocols to enhance health and well-being in general. The project consists of two large randomized controlled trials and smaller needs assessment and usability studies that will guide their development and deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia. This project will develop Artificial Intelligence-based reminder systems to help ensure long-term engagement to home-based cognitive assessment and cognitive training protocols to be able to detect and treat cognitive impairment as soon as possible.",The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline,9986599,R01AG064529,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Life Style', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Weight', 'aging population', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cognitive training', 'design', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile computing', 'next generation', 'person centered', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,692873,-0.034782259808522335
"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions. Our proposed work will be significant as it will provide epidemiologists with a novel and robust tool to assess exposure to environmental pollutant mixtures. Project Narrative We are constantly exposed to a mixture of environmental pollutants at once, but current epidemiologic methods either assess each pollutant separately, not capturing reality, or have severe limitations. With this study we propose to adapt a wildly popular method used in computer vision applications, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), and develop flexible extensions for many epidemiologic settings. We propose to assess the performance of this method, compare with existing methods and employ in real-life applications, as well as develop and share software so other research can also use this novel, robust and flexible tool.",Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies,9843133,R01ES028805,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational workshop', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Poison', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Work', 'cardiovascular emergency', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'policy implication', 'pollutant', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,569866,0.0643844599903189
"San Diego Nathan Shock Center PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Since aging is the biggest risk factor of most human diseases and the overall functional decline in individuals, there is great interest in understanding its biological underpinnings, with the ultimate goal of increasing the number of healthy and productive years of human life (i.e., healthspan). Conserved mechanisms of aging and longevity have been identified via investigations into the basic biology of aging. These include studies in model organisms that have also shown that aging is pliable, opening the door for healthspan-promoting interventions. However, a major complicating factor that impedes our understanding of aging and our ability to intervene is the intrinsic and induced heterogeneity of the process. Distinct cell types have intrinsically different aging modalities, and even identical cell types age at different rates depending on physiological context or environmental exposures. These and other cellular heterogeneities (e.g., altered epigenetic states and gene expression) can drive tissue dysfunction and age-related pathology that ultimately impact healthspan and lifespan. Unravelling this complexity experimentally requires application of robust single-cell and imaging approaches to address the heterogeneity of cellular aging head-on, as well as computational and mathematical modelling approaches to illuminate aging networks and pathway interactions that involve known hallmarks of aging. Another major gap in aging research is the need for new and better human cell and tissue models to allow basic research directly relevant to human aging. Thus, the overarching premise of the proposed San Diego Nathan Shock Center (SD-NSC) is to create the requisite infrastructure to facilitate and promote the systematic study of cellular heterogeneity in aging and to provide novel cell and tissue models for basic human aging studies. The SD-NSC will establish cutting-edge Research Resource Cores focused on: 1) novel human cell and organoid models of aging, including from a unique human aging cohort that is annotated for physical and functional measures of biological age, 2) single-cell and high resolution -omics and imaging techniques, and 3) computational modelling of aging networks. The SD-NSC Research Resource Cores will provide scientific services to the NSC Network and the aging research community, and disseminate samples, datasets protocols, and computational tools. These resources will be complemented by a Research Development Core and Center outreach activities that will provide: 1) pilot grants and customized mentoring programs to encourage and support early-stage and established investigators new to aging research, 2) innovative in- person and virtual training in advanced methods and technologies to address cellular heterogeneity, and 3) intellectual leadership through novel programming to encourage collaboration and the dissemination of knowledge related to the basic biology of aging. The SD-NSC will bring together complementary expertise and resources from three renowned San Diego research Institutions with the common goal of understanding the role of cellular heterogeneity in aging to ultimately enable interventions to extend human healthspan. PROJECT NARRATIVE The cells and tissues of the human body age at different rates depending on their precise anatomical location and environment. We currently do not have a full understanding of this “heterogeneity” and how it contributes to overall human aging or the enhanced risk of diseases with age.

"Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce ABSTRACT The overarching goal of the “Alcoa Study” remains the development of increasingly rich models to explain the disparate health and work-capacity trajectories demonstrated in this universally insured, geographically, socially and economically diverse cohort of 200,000+ men and women as they progress from work-life into retirement. Outcomes of focus remain incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to 1) early life social context via Census data; 2) personal and family work experience and income across the life span via IRS and SSA; 3) post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI) and 4) contextual social environment from lifetime residential geocoding. Consequently, we propose in the next cycle to embrace a life course approach to study the social, environmental and behavioral determinants of the outcomes listed above The specific aims of this grant are: Aim 1: Link Alcoa workers to individual census records to examine how early life environment influences later life health outcomes; Aim 2: Assess the impact on health and function of adverse working environment as it accrues during work-life, with an emphasis on ubiquitous physical hazards; Aim 3: Identify antecedents of short-term and long-term disability across working life as candidates for subsequent hypothesis testing; Aim 4: Assess the impact disability benefits have on employee work function and health; Aim 5: Examine how injuries and health shocks affect retirement savings and subsequent health trajectories; Aim 6: To address generalizability across studies and populations, compare the Alcoa population to relevant complementary datasets, administrative and survey. Viewed altogether, continuation of the Alcoa study with the assembled team of investigators provides an unparalleled opportunity to address a host of critical empiric and methodologic issues previously unapproachable. In addition to understanding better which occupational exposures contribute to chronic disease and disability, these data will allow us to control for economic and other contextual factors to an extraordinary degree. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Alcoa research infrastructure—linking quantitative exposure measures to myriad hazards of active workers whose behavior, social environment and health status from pre-employment through retirement to death are fully observed—provides a unique opportunity to extend our work on the outcomes of focus including incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to early life social context, personal and family work experience and income and post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI).","Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce",9965695,R01AG026291,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Disability Insurance', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Occupational Health', 'Outcome', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Price', 'Privatization', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Shock', 'Social Environment', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Veterans', 'Vietnam', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disability impact', 'experience', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'mortality', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'uptake']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,691831,0.020844228383042958
"MUFA-SIRT1 signaling as a central node regulating healthspan PROJECT SUMMARY Macronutrients serve a multitude of roles beyond provision of energy, with numerous nutrients and/or their downstream metabolites acting as signaling molecules to coordinate cellular metabolism and function. Indeed, numerous nutrient sensing pathways (e.g. mTOR, AMPK and sirtuins) have evolved allowing us to respond to specific nutrients/metabolites, which in turn impacts healthspan. Sirtuins are largely thought to be driven by redox, whereby high levels of NAD, a cofactor in the sirtuin reaction and indicator of low energy charge, drives sirtuin-catalyzed deacylation of target proteins. SIRT1, the most-studied sirtuin, is a key nutrient sensing node that regulates a plethora of cellular functions to promote lifespan extension and healthy aging. As a result, there is immense interest in the use of SIRT1 activating compounds (STACs) to prevent or treat a wide range of aging-related disease. The links between dietary macronutrients, nutrient sensing and healthspan have historically focused upon caloric or protein restriction with limited attention given to dietary lipids. However, a small and growing body of literature has linked monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) to improved healthspan. In addition to positive effects on lifespan and healthy aging in model organisms, dietary MUFAs have been linked to wide-ranging health benefits in epidemiological studies and, since they are a primary constituent of olive oil, thought to contribute to the benefits of the Mediterranean Diet. Despite these studies, little is known about the biological underpinnings through which MUFAs elicit their beneficial health effects. We have previously shown that lipid droplet catabolism (i.e. lipolysis) increases SIRT1 and downstream PGC-1a/PPAR- a signaling as a means to increase mitochondrial biogenesis and function during times of nutrient deprivation. Our preliminary data show for the first time that MUFAs released specifically from lipolysis are trafficked to the nucleus where they allosterically activate SIRT1 towards select acetylated peptide substrates. This discovery makes MUFAs the first-known endogenous allosteric activators of SIRT1. Moreover, we show that MUFAs activate SIRT1 through a similar mechanism to resveratrol suggesting that MUFA signaling may modulate the response to exogenous SIRT1 activators. Based on these preliminary data, the objective of this application is to further characterize the role of MUFAs as endogenous SIRT1 activators. We hypothesize that MUFAs selectively activate SIRT1 to modulate the response to numerous dietary interventions known to impact healthspan. To test our objective, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: To define how MUFAs modulate SIRT1 substrate selectivity. Aim 2: To characterize the SIRT1-dependent effects of MUFAs/olive oil on healthspan. Aim 3: To determine the contribution of MUFAs in mediating the response to STACs or caloric restriction.

"Integrating epidemiologic and environmental approaches to understand and predict Coccidioides exposure and coccidioidomycosis emergence Project Summary Coccidioidomycosis is an infection caused by inhalation of spores from the soil-dwelling fungi Coccidioides immitis or C. posadasii, and can lead to chronic lung infection, meningitis, or death. Southwestern states are currently experiencing among the highest incidence rates of coccidioidomycosis ever recorded. The disease has levied a substantial human and economic burden throughout the southwest, totaling an estimated $2.2 billion in charges in California alone for coccidioidomycosis-associated hospitalizations from 2000-2011. Critical gaps in understanding have hindered the public health response, including how dust, pathogen, and individual risk factors interact to determine disease incidence, as well as how environmental factors influence the distribution of the pathogen and dust. To address these gaps, this project investigates the impacts of dust exposure, environmental variability, and sociodemographic change on Coccidioides spp. proliferation, dispersion, and coccidioidomycosis infection rates in California. The research focuses on three main aims: 1) investigate the influence of climate variation and dust exposure on the spatiotemporal distribution of cocci incidence using >65,000 geolocated surveillance records from 2000 to 2018 and a case-crossover design; 2) identify environmental sources of C. immitis at high spatial and temporal resolution in disturbed and undisturbed soil, and determine how wind, rainfall, soil disturbance and other factors influence spore dispersion through longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil; and 3) predict changes in pathogen density over space and time and estimate the exposure-response relationship between pathogen density and risk of infection using a case-crossover approach with prospective surveillance for incident cases. In pursuit of these aims, the research will combine georeferenced coccidioidomycosis case data across California since 2000 at an unprecedented spatial resolution with fine-scale dust concentration estimates and environmental data from a combination of remote sensing, modeling and ground monitors. We will use novel field and laboratory methods to conduct longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil, determining how microenvironmental conditions and cyclical patterns of rainfall and drought determine pathogen source dynamics, and identifying conditions that support pathogen dispersion through the air. Through these activities, we will identify the specific dust conditions that pose the greatest risk for infection, estimate pathogen exposure and the dose- response relationship, and evaluate heterogeneity in this relationship across risk groups and regions. The results will elucidate drivers of the current epidemic, enhance understanding of the distribution and dispersion of Coccidioides spp. in the environment, and identify high risk regions and subpopulations. The knowledge gained will support decision-makers in targeting, designing and implementing protective measures for vulnerable populations. Project Narrative This project addresses gaps in our understanding of the kinds of dust exposures, and the environmental and social conditions, that increase the incidence of coccidioidomycosis in the southwest. The findings will have wide-ranging benefits for public health, including a better understanding of how people are exposed to the pathogen, the identification of areas and people that are at the highest risk, and predictions of future coccidioidomycosis that can be used to prevent infection in vulnerable groups.",Integrating epidemiologic and environmental approaches to understand and predict Coccidioides exposure and coccidioidomycosis emergence,9865174,R01AI148336,"['Address', 'Air', 'Area', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Climatology', 'Coccidioides', 'Coccidioides immitis', 'Coccidioides posadasii', 'Coccidioidomycosis', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Droughts', 'Dust', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Environmental Wind', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'High temperature of physical object', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Influenza', 'Inhalation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung infections', 'Measures', 'Meningitis', 'Meteorology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproduction spores', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Social Conditions', 'Soil', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'burden of illness', 'density', 'design', 'environmental intervention', 'experience', 'fungus', 'high risk', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen exposure', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'remote sensing', 'response', 'sociodemographics', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'temporal measurement', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,774446,0.013227929579700726
"Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis Project Summary: Brain networks linking the cortex to thalamus are critical for cognitive, sensory, and motor functioning. Dysruption of thalamocortical networks has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including psychosis, and mechanisms of clinical phenotypes, especially cognitive impairment. This view is supported by neuroimaging, including a series of studies by the Co-PIs, which consistently find a combination of reduced thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor-thalamic hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While significant progress has been made, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the normal developmental trajectory of thalamocortical networks and onset of connectivity disturbances in psychosis; relationship between cognitive functions supported by thalamocortical circuits and thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers; and clinical utility of imaging thalamocortical networks. The availability of several large-scale cross-sectional datasets containing multi-modal neuroimaging data and extensive phenotypic data on healthy and at-risk individuals has created an unprecedented opportunity to address these critical knowledge gaps. They include the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN: n=656, ages 18-88); Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI- RS: n=932, ages 6-85); Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics dataset (PING: N=1239, ages 3-20); Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC: n=1601, ages 8-21), which includes psychosis spectrum (PS) youth; and the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS: n=397). Building on our prior work in clinical populations and leveraging the considerable resources of these datasets, we propose to chart the development of thalamocortical networks in healthy subjects (Aim 1) and youth with PS symptoms (Aim 2), characterize the associations between thalamocortical biomarkers and cognition (Aim 3), and investigate the clinical utility of thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers at identifying atypical brain development in individual subjects across the psychosis continuum and predicting conversion to psychosis in clinical high risk individuals (Aim 4). The proposed Aims will: 1) establish critical normative lifespan development data for refining and testing etiological models of not just psychosis, but other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as aging- related disorders; 2) inform the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders and contribute to dimensional models of psychosis; 3) help define the neural basis of executive cognitive abilities thereby providing the necessary foundation for mechanistic models of normal cognitive function and cognitive impairment in psychosis; and 4) potentially provide risk biomarkers and intervention targets for youth at risk for developing a psychotic disorder. Public Health Relevance: Many psychiatric disorders emerge between childhood and early adulthood, a period when the brain is undergoing significant developmental changes, and are associated with cognitive impairment which leads to lifelong limitations in psychosocial functioning. Determining how and when premorbid brain development goes awry, clarifying the neural basis of cognitive impairment, and establishing the clinical utility of brain-based biomarkers at predicting illness onset in individuals at high risk for neuropsychiatric illness are essential to developing targeted interventions that prevent the onset of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.",Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis,9893033,R01MH115000,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age effect', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'symptomatology', 'young adult']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,392508,-0.015518820825008753
"Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population Project Summary This project will enhance and develop the only source of data that provides core information about work, education, income, and migration for the entire U.S. population. This unique resource allows us to observe today's late-life population when they were young. This allows a prospective view of the impact of early-life environments and socioeconomic status on health and well-being in later life. The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3. Apply new technologies to democratize access to the data through new data access tools and a virtual data  enclave for a restricted version of the data that contains names. This project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. Narrative This project will develop data for prospective analysis of the impact of early-life circumstances and environment on health outcomes in late life, including Alzheimer's disease. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years.

"Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity PROJECT SUMMARY  Wildfire occurrence, duration, and intensity have heightened in recent decades and continue to impact the health of millions of individuals worldwide. Smoke that is emitted from wildfires consists of a complex mixture of particulate matter and toxic gases. The chemical composition of wildfire smoke is dependent upon the type of biomass burn conditions and fuel type, which are heavily influenced by geographical region. The chemical mixtures within wildfire smoke that humans are exposed to can consequently cause variable health outcomes through potentially different biological mechanisms. Human exposure to wildfire smoke represents a growing concern in public health, and adequately characterizing health risks associated with biomass smoke across varying burn conditions and geographic areas is not possible with the data currently available.  The variabilities in toxicological responses across wildfire smoke exposure conditions have yet to be fully established and evaluated in the context of chemical composition. The growing threat of wildfires necessitates the elucidation of individual and/or co-occurring components of wildfire smoke that act as the primary drivers of toxicity. To address this important research issue, we expand upon a foundational study that has previously characterized the chemical constituents in various biomass burn scenarios and evaluated, in part, toxicological responses to these exposures in the mouse lung. Here, we leverage this extensive database and banked samples to: 1. characterize in vivo transcriptomic responses and pathway alterations associated with biomass smoke in the mouse lung; 2. integrate chemical-toxicity profiles using computational approaches to prioritize chemicals that are likely driving toxicity responses; and 3. further evaluate chemical drivers of biomass smoke toxicity responses using in vitro approaches.  This research will be carried out through a collaboration with laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, allowing for a unique combination of expertise for studying the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity. This expertise includes skills in computational toxicology, exposure science, and molecular biology, coupled with experience studying adverse health effects and immune responses induced by exposure to air pollutants. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exposure to wildfire smoke continues to be a growing threat to public health, yet the primary drivers of toxicity and disease are not completely understood. This proposal represents an innovative approach to increase understanding on the health effects of wildfires by leveraging a robust dataset of chemical-biological profiles from mice exposed to biomass smoke condensate samples derived from variable conditions. New data will also be generated alongside additional in vitro testing to more comprehensively examine mechanisms of toxicity and identify the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity, resulting in improved abilities to predict region- specific health risks attributable to wildfires.",Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity,9956440,R21ES031740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemically Induced Toxicity', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gases', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inhalation', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mus', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Smoke', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Wildfire', 'asthma exacerbation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'biomass smoke', 'computational toxicology', 'data integration', 'data reduction', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'exposed human population', 'genotoxicity', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'male', 'novel', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'smoke inhalation', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,227277,0.007853434567791874
"Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Extensive progress was made in the previous funding period of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We 1) elucidated the neuropathologic basis of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD), 2) discovered genomic, experiential, psychological, and medical risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits including numerous risk factors for Alzheimer’s dementia with little to no relationship with ADRD brain pathologies, and 3) identified numerous potential novel therapeutic targets for cognitive decline, especially targets for cognitive decline not explained by common brain pathologies i.e., resilience. Here, the average person has average resilience and individuals can be more or less resilient. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target because if druggable it would offset the effects of any combination of brain pathologies. In this funding cycle, we propose to continue to follow MAP participants and conduct autopsies, and in this cycle, to obtain skin biopsies at autopsy to support a powerful new drug discovery program that integrates existing brain omics data with a new human cellular model of disease, i.e., skin derived fibroblast cultures induced into neuronal lines from persons with more or less resilience. We propose to: 1) define a robust and specific molecular signature of resilience in the human brain; 2) identify gene targets of resilience and establish human low-resilience cell models derived from MAP participants of known resilience; and 3) conduct drug discovery screens in the low-resilience models to identify compounds that increase resilience. These aims are supported by compelling preliminary work. An Exploratory Aim will continue to identify risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits leveraging the rich resource generated from the exposure data, repeated measures, and neuropathologic traits . All aims will examine sex as a biologic variable. A Secondary Aim will continue to share the unique and valuable resources generated by MAP including the to-be-generated fibroblast cell lines with the scientific community. Harnessing mechanisms of resilience to ADRD can slow down or prevent cognitive decline regardless of the presence and complexity of common brain pathologies. Therefore, the genes and compounds identified from our study will provide new therapeutic remedies to boost brain reserve in combating ADRD-related dementia. We believe that the proposed continuation will have a high and sustained impact on the field of aging and dementia research. POJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The identification of novel therapeutics to prevent of cognitive decline, MCI and Alzheimer’s dementia is a major public health priority. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target with the potential to maintain cognition regardless of the type and number of brain pathologies. The proposed continuation of MAP will identify genes and compounds that affect a molecular signature of resilience in a novel human cell model of disease from autopsied MAP partic ipants .",Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging,10018624,R01AG017917,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Funding', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Persons', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-3', 'base', 'combat', 'data hub', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'human model', 'in silico', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'sex', 'therapeutic target', 'trait']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,3035766,-0.013470611732783843
"Role of Epigenetically Active  Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), are increasingly recognized as originating from dysregulation of early brain development, which represents a window of vulnerability to environmental compounds. Environmental compounds may alter neurodevelopment via epigenetic mechanisms, which may not induce massive cell death, but change the brain function through their epigenetic effect on stem cell fate and lineage development. However, tools to systematically examine the epigenetic impact of environment on neurodevelopment are lacking. Here we employ Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape (MIEL) to screen ToxCast Phase III chemical library (4700 compounds) and to characterize hits that alter epigenetic landscape of human neural precursors without inducing cytotoxicity. Recognizing environmental insults and understanding their mechanism of action will enable the development of regulations and guidelines aimed at avoiding such insults and the development of antidotes and protective agents when exposure is unavoidable. PROJECT NARRATIVE We developed a novel technique rooted in analysis of the epigenome topography at the single-cell level.

"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9942495,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,173441,0.032208616402735424
"Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the developed world; no cure exists and prevalence is rising rapidly. Because only primates have a macula and since no model of AMD exists in non-human primates, the disease course can only be elucidated through in-depth study of humans. Blindness in AMD is caused by progressive and irreversible death of rod and cone photoreceptors secondary to degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that is essential for their health and function. Clinical imaging and histology have informed us greatly about the later stages of disease but fundamental knowledge to understand how AMD diverges from normal aging at onset is lacking. With advanced adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy (AOO) imaging methods, combined with clinical imaging and visual function testing, we will characterize healthy human retinal aging in cross-sectional study, by defining the in vivo RPE-photoreceptor cellular organization and microscopic autofluorescence variation with age and wavelength. This will produce the largest quantitative in vivo normative dataset of AOO cell-based metrics to date and we will use this data to generate new quantitative analysis tools needed to evaluate emerging therapies designed to prevent or slow vision loss in AMD (Aim 1). In a case-control study, we will then compare normal photoreceptor topography and RPE cell morphometry to clinically defined early AMD to quantitatively define the earliest cellular changes in AMD that can be detected in vivo. This work will identify the cellular alterations and phenotypes that differentiate normal aging from early AMD to facilitate early onset detection. These results will be contextualized by comparison to tissue-level alterations seen with aging and early AMD in clinical imaging, specifically choriocapillaris decline and drusen (Aim 2). The results of this study will result in a paradigm shift from the use of clinical diagnosis and classification systems for AMD that rely solely on tissue- level biomarkers or traditional funduscopic clinical signs to those that rely on rigorous quantitative in vivo cell- based metrics. Together, this knowledge and these tools will lay the foundation needed to develop and evaluate new preventative therapies that are needed to limit or prevent vision loss in AMD. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the US and is a significant public health issue that is projected to worsen due to the rapidly aging population. Here we aim to understand how retinal cells change in normal aging and how these normal age-related changes differ from the changes that lead to age-related macular degeneration. This project will allow us to detect age-related macular degeneration earlier and will produce new tools to monitor retinal cells that will facilitate the development and testing of preventative therapies to slow or prevent vision loss in age-related macular degeneration.",Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye,9973645,R01EY030517,"['Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Choroid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lipofuscin', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Melanins', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Primate Diseases', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Retina', 'Retinal Cone', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Photoreceptors', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Evaluation', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vertebrate Photoreceptors', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adaptive optics', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'fluorophore', 'healthy aging', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'macula', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neurovascular unit', 'nonhuman primate', 'normal aging', 'prevent', 'restorative treatment', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal rods', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,527040,-0.007074608006834205
"Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality ABSTRACT  Some of the most important open questions in aging relate to the impact of longitudinal and intergenerational factors. But documenting the role of early-life and intergenerational determinants of health and aging is limited by the dearth of large-scale micro-data containing this information. This is especially true for understudied populations such as women and minority groups.  Our research objective is to add critical information on cause of death to the new large-scale data resource, the Longitudinal, Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-database (LIFE-M). Funded by the National Science Foundation, LIFE-M links millions of vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates) to decennial censuses over four generations and 120 years for five states. LIFE-M is a representative sample of cohorts aging and dying in the last 25 years of the 20th century and includes crucial early-life and intergenerational information. Enhancing the LIFE-M with cause of death will facilitate path-breaking research on the relationship of longevity and cause of death with demographic, socio-economic, and early-life environmental factors for family networks across four generations.  We will achieve this objective by pursuing the following specific aims:  (1) We will use new “Smart Indexing” technology to digitize and cross-validate hand-written cause-of-death information;  (2) We will link digitized causes of death to the LIFE-M infrastructure and create extensive documentation for  this new variable for public use; and  (3) We will publicly release the cause-of-death variable and documentation with the LIFE-M dataset, meta-  data, and supporting documentation on ICPSR in 2020.  The proposed project will also have broader impacts. In addition to contributing a significant new data resource that can be added to Minnesota Population Center's historical linked censuses and the Census Longitudinal Infrastructure Project (CLIP), this project's methodological innovations in script digitization will enhance on-going and future data infrastructure initiatives. Both contributions promise to transform the research frontier in population health and aging in the United States. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by adding cause-of-death information to a new intergenerational and longitudinal dataset (LIFE-M). These data will allow much more research on the long- term determinants of health and aging, including a deeper understanding the intergenerational and early-life origins of later-life diseases and mortality in today's aging population.",Longitudinal and Intergenerational Determinants of Aging and Mortality,9829517,R01AG057704,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Biogenesis', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Complement', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Certificates', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hand', 'Handwriting', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Resources', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immigrant', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Maiden Name', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Michigan', 'Minnesota', 'Minority Groups', 'Names', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Price', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Science', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Toxin', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data infrastructure', 'data resource', 'early-life nutrition', 'ethnic minority population', 'frontier', 'health knowledge', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'large scale data', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'population health', 'population survey', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'suicide rate']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,307227,0.02108573503001349
"Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT The overarching goals of this R01 proposal are to improve scientific understanding of potential mechanisms by which ophthalmic diseases lead to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will leverage modern ophthalmic data with state-of-the-art imaging and extensive archived clinical data from a well-characterized cohort of older adults. The investigators propose to examine the effect of structural and functional changes in retina and longitudinal severity of ophthalmic diseases on Alzheimer’s disease and related neuropathology. The proposal builds on the resources of the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, a prospective longitudinal, population-based, dementia-free cohort of over 5,500 people to date established in 1994 which has detected >1,014 research quality diagnoses of Alzheimer’s disease and >1,254 dementia to date. ACT follows consenting participants to autopsy and has performed state-of-the arts autopsy on >781 decedents to date. In this extremely well-characterized cohort, the investigators found that several ophthalmic diseases (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration) are significantly associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The investigators will use three advanced ophthalmic imaging modalities at both home and clinical research study visits: fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and OCT angiography (OCTA), to obtain quantitative data relevant to these ophthalmic diseases. The study team will establish the distribution (Aim 1a) and 2- and 4-year evolution of ophthalmic imaging characteristics found in older adults in the community and determine associations with change in cognition (Aim 1 b, c). Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI angiography (MRA) will be obtained in a subset of participants to investigate the contribution of small (retinal) and large (cerebral) vascular disease towards cognitive changes (Aim 1d). The study team will continue ACT study’s strong commitment for meaningful data sharing. In collaboration with the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging at University of Southern California, the study team will promulgate these ophthalmic data in addition to neuroimaging data to the research community (Aim 1e). In Aim 2, the investigators will use extensive clinical ophthalmology data captured over many decades and incorporate them in novel longitudinal models of eye disease severity. The investigators will analyze eye disease severity along with extensive neuropathology data from the ACT study, including both standard (Aim 2a) and novel quantitative (Aim 2b) neuropathology data, to further scientific understanding of neuropathological mechanisms underlying associations between eye conditions and Alzheimer’s disease risk. The brain is not amenable to direct observations during life. In contrast, the eye is an anterior extension of the central nervous system and may provide a valuable window to illuminate neurodegenerative processes in the aging brain. Proposed investigations will substantially enhance scientific understanding of the role of modern ophthalmic evaluations in delineating risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of neuropathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using a large, well-characterized, longitudinal, prospective, cohort study, the study team previously found that diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration were significantly associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk. The team proposes to use three cutting edge ophthalmic imaging modalities to obtain quantitative data at both home and clinic research study visits in addition to MRI and MRA in a subset of participants to evaluate their associations with change in cognition over time (Aim 1). The team will leverage extensive ophthalmic clinical and neuropathological data already available for 781 study participants to date as well as new state-of-the-art quantitative measures of beta amyloid (Aβ1-42) and phosphorylated tau to elucidate mechanisms underlying associations between ophthalmic conditions and Alzheimer’s disease (Aim 2).",Aging eyes and aging brains in studying alzheimer's disease: Modern ophthalmic data collection in the adult changes in thought (ACT) study,10005108,R01AG060942,"['Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Angiography', 'Anterior', 'Archives', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neuraxis', 'Occipital lobe', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Selection Bias', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'area striata', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis quality', 'epidemiology study', 'fiber cell', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'paired helical filament', 'population based', 'prospective', 'public repository', 'research study', 'resilience', 'tau Proteins', 'tau-1', 'vascular contributions']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,3349913,-0.05605200681086525
"Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys 7. Abstract.  The ability to identify and follow-up neurobiological changes that occur during brain maturation and aging is not only fundamental to our understanding of cognition, but is also crucial for clinical studies that focus on either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, including clinical trials. While post-mortem studies provide data that are well characterized in terms of localized histological changes, these data can be limited due to their cross sectional nature and small samples sizes. In contrast, non-invasive in vivo imaging allows for the collection of longitudinal data in much larger populations, and is a more powerful tool to investigate life span trajectories of brain maturation and aging. Recent developments in neuroimaging have provided evidence for the relationship between imaging changes and cognitive aging in monkeys, and humans. Unfortunately, the cellular underpinnings of cognitive age are a subject of debate and hence the biological specificity of available imaging measures is not well established. More alarming, while older imaging measures still lack thorough validation, newer “more specific” measures that are being constantly introduced into clinical research are even further from validation. Over the past funding period, we have worked with a large repository of histological, cognitive and imaging legacy data from cognitively aging rhesus monkeys, testing the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and myelin degeneration play crucial roles in cognitive aging, and that neuroimaging biomarkers can reflect those biological processes. We propose to further our work in this direction, by proposing translational experiments that will include 1). acquiring new, high resolution “Human Connectome Project (HCP)” compatible imaging data, 2). Expand our neuroimaging by adding neuroinflammation- and myelin-specific PET radioligands, 3). Develop neuroimaging white matter-specific biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment- a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and 4). Investigate biological underpinnings of sex differences in aging. This is enabled by a collaboration of three PIs, with unique and complementary expertise in MRI imaging, morphometry, neuroanatomy, immunohistochemistry and cognitive aging, and will be further facilitated by acquiring and analyzing behavioral, imaging, blood and post mortem data from a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys of both sexes, 8 young adults (4 males and 4 females) and 16 old adults (8 males and 8 females, half diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. 8. Project Narrative. The three PIs and their co-investigators propose a multidisciplinary study of cognitive aging in rhesus monkeys. We plan to acquire new, state of the art imaging data, and combine it with cognitive assessments, blood measures, and postmortem brain tissue to explore the biological underpinnings and establish the specificity of the imaging biomarkers to neurobiology of cognitive aging. The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many other clinical populations including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases of central nervous system.",Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys,9988322,R01AG042512,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Astrocytes', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cell Aging', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Ligands', 'Longevity', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuroglia', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Specificity', 'Spin Labels', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Work', 'age related', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'juvenile animal', 'male', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'myelin degeneration', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuroinflammation', 'radioligand', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change', 'young adult']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,832266,0.02387060231731467
"A Cognitive Risk Calculator and Screening tool for Primary Care Settings PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The number of people with Alzheimer’s disease is expected to exceed 88 million by 2050. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders symptoms are imperative for efforts to develop disease modifying therapies or interventions, and are important for optimal patient care. The objective of this proposal is to provide an accurate, feasible, and low-cost process to facilitate cognitive screening in population health. The aims of the R61 project are to develop and validate two complementary, automated tools to identify and screen patients at high risk for cognitive decline. The first is a risk calculator that uses routine clinical data to estimate patients’ risk for cognitive decline. Patients 60 years and older will undergo formal cognitive testing, and five prior years of routinely-collected electronic health record data will be used to model cognitive status. The Cognitive Risk Calculator will be validated in two historical samples and integrated into the electronic medical record to help providers identify vulnerable patients. The second tool is a validated iPad-based screening tool, the Brief Assessment of Cognitive Health (BACH) that patients can complete independently before, during, or after their doctor appointment. Patients will complete the BACH, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (a paper-and-pencil screening tool), and formal neuropsychological testing at two time points. We hypothesize the BACH will be more sensitive to cognitive change over time than the established screening tool. The BACH is already integrated into the Epic electronic medical record platform; cognitive score and screening results for depression, stress, and sleep disruption are automatically recorded in the patient’s medical record for providers to document and act upon. The R33 project is a Phase IV pragmatic clinical trial to gauge the uptake and utility of these tools in primary care practices. Six internal medicine clinics will be randomized over time to the active study arm (Risk Calculator and BACH). This will permit comparisons of standard of care screening practices with screening activities following introduction of the Cognitive Risk Calculator and BACH. We will use a mixed-methods approach to determine optimal implementation strategies across a variety of practice models. Impact: The EHR risk-calculator and BACH have the capacity to improve detection of cognitive decline on a population health scale. The project also examines how regional differences in socioeconomic advantage relate to health disparities measured in terms of cognitive risk as well as screening attitudes and behaviors on the part of both providers and patients.

"Planning for a Cohort Study on Neurocognitive Complication of Type 1 Diabetes in Children Project Summary. Children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) suffer from subtle cognitive impairments and structural alterations in the brain. These impairments progress with age and may eventually lead to increased difficulty managing the disease, resulting in worsening glycemic control, potentially life-threatening complications, and reductions in quality of life. Causes of cognitive decline in T1D are not well understood. Episodes of hypoglycemia, chronic hyperglycemia, glycemic variability and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) have all been suggested to play roles. Increased understanding of factors linked to cognitive decline in T1D, and the mechanisms responsible for these associations, is essential such that interventions to preserve cognition could be proposed. Recent data suggest that neuroinflammation resulting from hyperglycemia and episodes of DKA may be play a prominent role in causing cognitive decline. There is also evidence that modifiable factors such as nutrition, exercise, and sleep quality might modulate effects of chronic neuroinflammation and influence cognitive outcomes. In this project, we will engage in efforts to plan a comprehensive study of factors associated with cognition in children with T1D. At the completion of the proposed planning project, we will be prepared to conduct a longitudinal cohort study of children with newly diagnosed T1D. This study will determine how glycemic control and DKA exposure predict altered brain structure and cognition and establish whether markers of neuronal injury and inflammatory processes explain these longitudinal relations. Proposed assessments will include T1D-related factors (glycemic control, glycemic variability, hypoglycemia, DKA), brain structure and cognitive function (attention, memory and IQ). In addition, we will plan measurements of inflammatory mediators and markers of neuroinflammation using blood assays (cytokine measurements, exosome analyses, RNA microarrays), and evaluate factors that might modify inflammation such as diet (nutrient content), sleep quality and exercise. To optimize the study design, we will utilize the expertise of a multidisciplinary team to develop the study protocol, including experts in pediatric diabetes, cognitive development, neural and systemic inflammation, MR imaging, nutrition, sleep medicine, and data science. The team will work together to finalizing the protocol, work-flow and outcome measures, and identify the necessary computational infrastructure and data analysis strategies. The team will also assess study feasibility (factors affecting enrollment success and tolerance of the protocol) and determine necessary sample size by evaluating variability in biochemical and imaging measures. Alternative approaches to increase participant retention, such as remote (online) versus in person cognitive testing, will be explored. At the conclusion of this planning project, we will have developed and optimized a protocol to explore factors associated with cognitive decline in children with T1D, laying a foundation for future studies aimed at preserving cognitive function. Narrative. Individuals with type 1 diabetes often have declines in cognitive function over time, with a high risk of cognitive impairments and dementia as older adults. The physiological events responsible for cognitive damage in T1D are not understood, and it is unclear how cognitive decline might be prevented. In the proposed project, we will plan a comprehensive, multi-center study to investigate factors associated with declines in cognition in children with T1D at onset of the disease and over time.",Planning for a Cohort Study on Neurocognitive Complication of Type 1 Diabetes in Children,10020976,U34DK123894,"['10 year old', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Antibodies', 'Attention', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Brain Injuries', 'Child', 'Childhood diabetes', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Diet', 'Disease Management', 'Elderly', 'Encephalitis', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family dynamics', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nutrient', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'RNA', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'computer infrastructure', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'dementia risk', 'diet and exercise', 'exosome', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'inflammatory marker', 'insulin dependent diabetes mellitus onset', 'long term memory', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuron loss', 'non-diabetic', 'nutrition', 'participant retention', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'secondary outcome', 'sleep quality', 'success']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U34,2020,352245,0.00923590213174753
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,9928464,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell proliferation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,653362,0.027579930948992387
