"MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions Project Summary The objective of ‘MegaPredict’ is to enable scientists to generate predictions for a natural product (or any molecule) and identify targets for efficacy assessment as well as identify any potential liabilities. We are building on our previous work which has compiled a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and other properties, in a form ready for model building. All of these models utilize the many sources of curated open data, including ChEMBL, ToxCast etc. We have developed a prototype of MegaPredict that utilizes Bayesian algorithm and ECFP6 fingerprints to output a list of prioritized ‘targets’. We realize that neither the algorithm or the descriptors may be optimal therefore we propose to address this as we validate MegaPredict and develop a product over this proposal. Our team is suitably qualified to develop the software needed and we will leverage our large collaborator network to assist us in validating the activity of compounds. We will initially create a script to take a natural product and score it against many thousands of machine learning models then rank the outputs to propose efficacy targets. We will use over 12,000 ChEMBL derived target-assay / bioactivity groups extracted from the ChEMBL v24 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements and other public datasets, using methodology that we have already partially developed. We can repeat this process for over 200 published compounds and access the outputs versus what is known. We intend to compare how the approach performs with synthetic drugs or drug-like compounds as well as natural products. We will assess whether other machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors can improve predictions. As we generate machine learning models such as Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth we will assess the predictions for natural products and compare with the Bayesian approach. We will compare ECFP6 with other 2D, 3D descriptors and physicochemical properties in order to identify the optimal combination for generating predictions for natural products and compare how this differs for synthetic compounds. We will validate our predictions for natural product efficacy assessment. We will work closely with multiple academic groups to generate predictions for at least 20 natural products of interest against over 20 different targets or diseases. Our goal will be to identify potential targets that were previously unknown and then generate in vitro data inhouse or with academic collaborators. Develop a prototype user interface for input of a structure, processing an input molecule and output of prioritized targets and liabilities. We have developed multiple software prototypes (e. Assay Central, MegaTox, etc.) previously and will ensure a user-friendly interface and develop new visualization methods and algorithms for prioritizing potential predicted targets based on the outputs of thousands of machine learning models. In Phase I, we will use the software internally with collaborators to rapidly prototype it. In Phase II we will develop a commercial product, and greatly expand our validation by building a larger network of academic and industry partners that would help to prioritize features of most relevance. Using the machine learning models which we have for natural products is limited because ECFP6 fingerprints cannot distinguish between these very different classes of molecules. But this provides us with an opportunity by going for a ""pharmacophore"" style approach (ideally without using 3D conformations directly). We will therefore focus on developing a ‘3D shape-based fingerprint’ or developing a novel ‘2D fingerprint’ that captures the ‘3D shape’ for natural- and druglike molecules. Currently, the public datasets in ChEMBL and PubChem etc. are made up of mostly druglike molecules, but if we have fingerprints that can compare drug-like and natural product-like molecules then we can likely reliably use our MegaPredict models for natural products as well. We can also attempt to rank natural products with our ChEMBL models or we can look through catalogs of druglike compounds using models derived from natural products. That would be an important innovation. Additionally, in Phase II it would be important to see if we could find uses for natural products with any of the 7000 rare diseases. Developing software that predicts potential natural product drug interactions with various targets could be useful to regulatory organizations as well as the pharmaceutical industry and may broaden utility of being able to more effectively mix natural product and druglike compounds in models will have a profound effect on the value of cheminformatics in this arena. Project Narrative Natural products have long been a source of therapeutics for human healthcare. Yet, some of the challenges with developing natural product treatments are identifying potential human disease related targets and avoiding others that might lead to undesirable natural product-drug interactions. Now there is considerable data in the public domain for millions of molecules with thousands of targets and ADME/T related properties that it is possible to use a suite of machine learning models for prospective prediction and profiling of a molecule’s properties from structure alone. We aim to build on our preliminary efforts to date to create a prototype for MegaPredict using various machine learning models which will enable academic and industrial scientists to generate predictions for a natural product or any molecule of interest and identify potential targets for efficacy and toxicity liability assessment. We will experimentally validate these predictions in-house or through our network of collaborators.",MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions,9846761,R43AT010585,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemistry', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Fingerprint', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'commercial application', 'deep neural network', 'drug discovery', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model building', 'novel', 'open data', 'pharmacophore', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'process repeatability', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'software development', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'synthetic drug', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-based tool']",NCCIH,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2019,68862,-0.008569213124018036
"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) “rule learning”, which abstracts the underlying “rules” by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas. Deep learning as an emerging machine-learning method has a great potential in utilizing these data in biomedical research. This project will develop and apply cutting-edge deep- learning methods to deliver various sequence-based computational tools for gaining new knowledge, accelerating drug development, and improving personalized diagnosis and treatment.",Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction,9691995,R35GM126985,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Plug-in', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'drug development', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'online resource', 'open source', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'software systems', 'supervised learning', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2019,378183,-0.04676846132759413
"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well. In contrast our mathematical methods will directly produce new antibody designs by learning from large-scale experiments that test antibodies for function against disease targets. !",Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences,9664620,R01CA218094,"['Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Fc Receptor', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunize', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Machines', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phage Display', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical methods', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive test', 'receptor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,573396,0.00774745683278893
"Development of a novel photocatalytic system for direct deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols involving machine learning Project Summary Development of general and efficient methods for functionalization of alcohols is highly warranted due to the ubiquity and prominence of this functional group in natural products. Such methods would allow for late-stage diversification of complex molecules and, consequently, could have a broad impact in natural product synthesis and preparation of relevant pharmaceutical materials. However, owing to the chemical inertness of alcohols, most methods typically require installation of activating groups for functionalization, making them unattractive from an atom- and step-economical perspective. Nonetheless, many advances have been made. In particular, the Barton-McCombie reaction has become an indispensable tool for reductive functionalization of alcohols. Unfortunately, this transformation requires pre- functionalization of the alcohol substrate, employs highly toxic tin reagents, and invokes the use high reaction temperatures or harmful UV light for initiation of radical intermediates. Furthermore, the overall transformation is limited to H-atom incorporation or reductive coupling with alkenes. Lastly, only a few deoxygenation methods exist that are amenable for late-stage and site-selective deoxygenation in complex systems. Moreover, physical organic chemistry tools available to facilitate the selection of a set of conditions or parameters to afford site-selectivity are limited. In this proposal, we will develop a mild and practical photocatalytic deoxygenation of alcohols. Our strategy will focus on solving the inherent limitation of the Barton McCombie reaction by 1) avoiding the use of toxic tin reagents, 2) obviating the need for pre-functionalization of the alcohol substrate, and 3) allowing for modular coupling of formed alkyl radicals via Ni-catalysis. Specific aim 1 explores the development of a novel photoredox-catalyzed deoxygenation of alcohols. In addition, we outline a general protocol for deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols via inception of the alkyl radical intermediate, formed via β-scission, with various radical electrophiles. Moreover, we highlight an innovative method for the direct cross-coupling of alcohols via metallophotoredox catalysis in both racemic and enantioselective fashion. Specific aim 2 addresses the design strategy for implementing physical chemistry techniques such as Machine Learning in order to facilitate optimization and prediction of reaction performance in multi-dimensional chemical space. Also, we outline applying this strategy to identify a set of optimal conditions to confer site-selective functionalization in complex polyols. Project Narrative Mild and site-controlled deoxygenation of alcohols could significantly accelerate the late-stage synthesis/diversification of important organic molecules; however, current methods often employ toxic tin reagents, harsh reaction conditions, and require prefunctionalization of the alcohols employed. The strategy proposed would allow for a mild photocatalytic deoxygenation, as well as deoxyfunctionalization, of alcohols that solves the aforementioned limitations of prior art. Moreover, the proposed strategy outlines implementation of physical organic chemistry tools Machine Learning in order to facilitate optimization and prediction of reaction performance in multi-dimensional chemical space.",Development of a novel photocatalytic system for direct deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols involving machine learning,9759306,F32GM129910,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Alkenes', 'Arts', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Development', 'Employment', 'Intercept', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Natural Products', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Organic Synthesis', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phosphines', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Preparation', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Tin', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Visible Radiation', 'alcohol involvement', 'catalyst', 'design', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'novel', 'polyol', 'predictive tools', 'tool']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,61226,-0.020186272377812106
"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards. Two detailed case studies on the intestinal microbiota will allow us to further validate our tools. Microbiota-derived metabolites have been detected in circulation and shown to engage host cellular pathways in organs and tissues beyond the digestive system. Identifying these metabolites is thus critical for understanding the metabolic function of the microbiota and elucidating their mechanisms. The complex test cases will challenge our techniques, provide feedback during development, and allow us to further disseminate our techniques. We will work closely with early adopters of our tools, as proposed in supporting letters, to further validate our tools and encourage wide adoption. All proposed tools will be open source and made accessible through the web. Our tools promise to change current practices in interpreting metabolomics data beyond what is currently possible with databases, current annotation tools, statistical and overrepresentation analysis, or combinations thereof. The use of machine learning and large data sets as proposed herein defines the most promising research direction in metabolomics analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Untargeted Metabolomics is a recently developed technique that allows the measurement of thousands of molecules in a biological sample. This work proposes several novel computational techniques that address limitations of current metabolomics analysis tools. We anticipate that this work will advance discoveries in biomedical research and have direct benefits to human health.",Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis,9886611,R01GM132391,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Circulation', 'Case Study', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Intestines', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nutritional', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'PubMed', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Subject Headings', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'chemical standard', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'gastrointestinal system', 'gut microbiota', 'interest', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'neural network', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'open source', 'physical property', 'small molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2019,379614,-0.010542241926662078
"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data.

"Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY The research interests of my group are rooted in explorations of new and useful conceptual models to improve the control and prediction of noncovalent interactions. Our research involves the use of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools, applications of density functional theory (DFT), cheminformatics, and machine-learning methods. A premise of our research is that aromaticity may be used to modulate many types of noncovalent interactions (such as hydrogen bonding, π-stacking, anion-π interactions). The reciprocal relationship we find, between “aromaticity” in molecules and the strengths of “noncovalent interactions,” is surprising especially since they are typically considered as largely separate ideas in chemistry. The innovation of this research is that it will enable use of intuitive “back-of-the-envelope” electron-counting rules (such as the 4n+2πe Hückel rule for aromaticity) to make predictions of experimental outcomes regarding the impact of noncovalent interactions. A five-year goal is to realize the use of our conceptual models in real synthetic examples prepared by our experimental collaborators. My research vision is to bridge discoveries of innovative concepts to their practical impacts for biomedical and biomolecular research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research proposal includes four projects that are jointly motivated by the challenge to control and predict noncovalent interactions in organic and biomolecular systems. The proposed work involves applications of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools and synergistic investigations with experimental collaborators.

"Image-guided robot for high-throughput microinjection of Drosophila embryos PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is submitted in response to the NIH Development of Animal Models and Related Biological Materials for Research (R21) program. The proposal develops an image-guided robotic platform that performs the automated delivery of molecular genetic tools and non-genetically encoded reagents such as chemical libraries, fluorescent dyes to monitor cellular processes, functionalized magnetic beads, or nanoparticles into thousands of Drosophila embryos in a single experimental session. The proposed work builds on recent engineering innovations in our collaborative group which has developed image-guided robotic systems that can precisely interface with single cells in intact tissue. The two Specific Aims provide for a systematic development of the proposed technologies. AIM 1 first engineers a robotic platform (‘Autoinjector’) that can scan and image Drosophila embryos in arrays of egg laying plates. We will utilize machine learning algorithms for automated detection of embryos, followed by thresholding and morphology analysis to detect embryo centroids and annotate injection sites. In AIM 2, we will utilize microprocessor-controlled fluidic circuits for programmatic delivery of femtoliter to nanoliter volumes of reagents into individual embryos. We will quantify the efficacy of the Autoinjector by comparing the survival, fertility, and transformation rates of transposon or PhiC31-mediated transgenesis to manual microinjection datasets. Finally, we will demonstrate the efficient delivery of sgRNAs and mutagenesis in the presence of Cas9. This project fits very well within the goals of the program by engineering a novel tool for producing and improving animal models. The Autoinjector will accelerate Drosophila research and empower scientists to perform novel experiments and genome-scale functional genomics screens that are currently too inefficient or labor intensive to be conducted on a large scale and may additionally enable other novel future applications.

"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,9705993,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,314000,-0.004703863834579617
"Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria Project Summary/Abstract Fungal and bacterial pathogens are a major threat to human health. Few therapeutics exist to treat fungal infections while bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to existing therapeutics. Humans have been using natural products to treat infections for thousands of years, long before the causal agents of infection were understood. Natural products have continued to be used as therapeutics in the modern age of medicine. Rates of rediscovery of known natural products have increased in traditional sources of natural products, such as soil bacteria. Recently, symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems have been recognized as a promising source of bioactive compounds, especially antifungal agents. These bacteria often produce natural products that defend an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use chemical biology approaches such as phenotypic interaction screens, genomics, and a new bioinformatics approach to systematically search for bioactive natural products produced by Actinobacteria symbionts and other organisms in insect agricultural systems. The first part of this proposal focuses on using existing techniques to identify new bioactive natural products. Phenotypic interaction screens can identify bioactive natural products by determining if a symbiotic bacteria produces a natural product that inhibits the growth of a fungal pathogen and vice-versa. We will then use genomic sequencing, bioinformatics, and heterologous expression to identify and characterize biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are not expressed in the phenotypic interaction screens. The second part of the proposed work involves the use of a new bioinformatics technique to identify interesting bioactive natural products. Existing bioinformatics techniques identify BGCs and predict the most likely chemical structure of the corresponding natural product. However, they do not conclude anything concerning the functional role that the natural product plays. The technique developed here will use machine learning to predict the function that the natural product fulfills in the ecological context of the organism. This algorithm will facilitate the identification of bioactive natural products with therapeutically relevant functions. Project Narrative Fungal infections are an underappreciated threat to human health with high mortality rates and few effective therapeutic agents for treatment. Symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems are a promising source of antifungal agents since they often produce natural products with antifungal activity protecting an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use phenotypic interaction screens, genome sequencing, and the development of a novel bioinformatics method to systematically mine Actinobacteria for antifungal and antibacterial products – leading to the discovery of new bioactive small molecules along with a deeper understanding of how natural products mediate the interaction between species in insect agricultural systems.",Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria,9716392,F32GM128267,"['Actinobacteria class', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Ants', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Breathing', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Insecta', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mycoses', 'Natural Products', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Soil', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bioactive natural products', 'drug discovery', 'fungus', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'post-doctoral training', 'prediction algorithm', 'small molecule', 'symbiont']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F32,2019,61226,0.0059051090885112005
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers.

"Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We have recently developed novel framework for next-generation quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) designed to meet the challenges of biomolecular simulations and drug discovery applications. QMFFs have tremendous computational advantages relative to their fully QM counterparts, being inherently parallelizable and linearly scaling, offering tremendous computational speedup, and promising quantitative accuracy potentially superior to full QM methods. QMFFs accurately model multipolar electrostatics, charge penetration effects, and non-linear polarization response. QMFFs thus offer a transformative technology for drug discovery applications, in particular, for advancing the predictive capability of free energy simulations in lead reﬁnement. These are critically important for the diverse chemical space of drug molecules, including halogen bonding, cation-  and metal-ligand interactions. Further, QMFFs offer a mechanism for modeling covalent inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, we propose to: I. Develop new QMFFs for drug discovery. QMFFs will be developed based on both semiempirical and ab initio density-functional methods in the following stages: 1) determination of multipolar mapping parameters enhancing the DFTB electrostatic potential to reach greater accuracy, 2) augmentation of electronic response terms using chemical potential equalization (CPE) corrections using an orthogonal perturbation-response approach to solve the under-polarization problem of DFTB methods, 3) parameterization of non-electrostatic non-bonded interac- tion parameters using realistic potentials that capture many-body exchange and dispersion interactions, and 4) exploration of statistical potentials, using machine learning approaches applied to quantum data sets, to correct internal conformational energies and short-range interactions. II. Develop new free energy methods to enable protein-ligand binding predictions using QMFFs. We will develop a novel integrated free energy pipeline to pre- dict alchemical binding free energies for ligands and inhibitors. This will include new GPU-accelerated methods for  -space self-adaptive mixture sampling ( -SAMS) and 2D-vFEP analysis, coupled with conformational space enhanced sampling methods for alchemical steps of the thermodynamic cycle, and advancements in free en- ergy “book-ending” methods (BBQm) to efﬁciently connect molecular mechanical force ﬁeld and QMFF model representations. III. Test and validate QMFFs and free energy methods, and apply to MIF inhibitor binding. The methods will be broadly tested against established data sets for solvation free energies, and a drug discovery data set. More in-depth validation studies will be conducted by examining the relative binding free energies of inhibitors of the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). Finally, exploratory applications will examine mechanisms, characterize transition states and predict rates for covalent inhibition for a series of MIF inhibitors. Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Laboratory for Biomolecular Simulation Research, Rutgers University, Piscat- away, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We propose a novel strategy to develop a class of integrated quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) that create highly accurate physical models for complex biomolecular simulations. Com- bined with recently developed high-precision free energy simulation and analysis tools, the pro- posed QMFFs will overcome current critical barriers to progress for drug discovery and deliver accurate and precise predictions for drug binding afﬁnity to enhance lead optimization. The pro- posed work will be applied to understand ligand-protein binding in the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF), and provide insight that may guide the design of new non-covalent and targeted covalent inhibitors to MIF and other systems.",Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications,9817829,R01GM107485,"['Affinity', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Books', 'Cations', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Free Energy', 'Halogens', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Penetration', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lead optimization', 'macrophage', 'mechanical force', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'programs', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2019,326559,-0.04464683217575926
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems.

"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease.

"An automated pipeline for macromolecular structure discovery in cellular  electron cryo-tomography SUMMARY – OVERALL Cellular cryo-tomography has emerged as a critical tool for the visualization and structural study of the molecular nanomachines at the heart of cellular function. Although the basic electron cryo-tomography technique has been used for several decades, the technology is being revolutionized by recent advances in sample preparation, electron cryo-microscopy hardware, improved capabilities for automatic data collection, direct electron detection imaging devices, and phase plate technologies. Combined, these advances led to the ability to generate extraordinarily large numbers of cellular cryo-tomograms of exquisite quality. In principle, such large data sets offer insights into cellular variation in disease states as well as better insights into basic cellular function, opening new possibilities for studying the underpinnings of health and disease at the finest possible level, potentially leading to completely new diagnostics for cancer and other cell-altering diseases. However, collection of cellular data is now at a far faster rate than can currently be analyzed with existing methods, producing a serious barrier to progress: to match the data production rates of a single laboratory, at least 50 experienced scientists would need to handle the data analysis. The primary goal of this Program Project is to establish quantitative and highly automated tools for the reconstruction and interpretation of highly complex cellular tomographic data. We have assembled a highly synergistic team of PIs with complimentary expertise in cutting-edge computational and experimental electron microscopy techniques to achieve this goal through collaborative efforts. Project 1 (Hanein & Penczek) focuses on development and implementation of tomogram quality assessment and validation techniques and on experimentally guided optimization of data collection strategies. Project 2 focuses on automatic tomographic reconstruction technology, extraction of various features from the tomograms, and the analysis of distribution patterns derived from the extracted features. Project 3 focuses on development of quantitative tools for tomogram annotation through deep learning and sub-tomogram alignment as well as interactive visualization tools. The set of highly automated tools developed in this Program Project will permit us to interpret 5–10x as much data as is possible using existing methods, greatly expanding the types of cellular variations we can effectively study. NARRATIVE Cellular cryo-tomography has emerged as a critical tool for the visualization and structural study of the molecular nanomachines at the heart of cellular function and—with recent instrumental advances—it is now possible to image hundreds of cells per months, enabling collection of cellular data at a far faster rate than can currently be analyzed.

This Program Project brings together an accomplished team of investigators to develop new strategies for effectively processing and interpreting this massive influx of data, developing a set of highly automated tools to permit us to interpret 5–10x as much data as is possible using existing methods, greatly expanding the types of cellular variations we can effectively study.",An automated pipeline for macromolecular structure discovery in cellular  electron cryo-tomography,9769773,P01GM121203,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cryo-electron tomography', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Environment', 'Floods', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Morphology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tomogram', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'computer framework', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'electron tomography', 'experience', 'imaging detection', 'improved', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'nanomachine', 'novel diagnostics', 'particle', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tomography', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIGMS,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,P01,2019,928444,-0.01688784076326589
"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology. This proposal specifically focuses on addressing the following knowledge gaps: 1) Despite the technological advances in harnessing RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas9 and Cas13 for research and clinical applications, we still do not understand the principles of gRNA selection for efficient and tunable RNA-targeting. This problem precludes the facile development of a number of RNA-targeting applications and underscores the need for a thorough interrogation of gRNA selection. Our goal here is to develop a model to predict highly-active gRNAs for Cas9/Cas13 RNA- targeting in human cells. We will use a combination of high-throughput RNA:protein interactome methods, flow- cytometry based gRNA screens and machine learning to precisely define features of highly active RNA-targeting gRNAs for RNA-binding and knockdown for Cas9 and Cas13. 2) The vast majority of human RNAs are alternatively spliced, and RNA splicing defects are common in cancers and neurological diseases. However, our understanding of the downstream functional effects of splicing in a majority of cases is rudimentary. To address this issue, we will develop a toolbox of robust, multiplexable Cas-based splicing factors to offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional consequences of alternative splicing. that can determine in a single step both the identity of proteins bound to a And 3) There is a paucity of methods specific RNA and their location on that RNA. The development of such an approach will enable us to determine the spatial arrangement of proteins on specific RNAs to dissect their dynamic deposition in range of RNA processes such as transcription, 3ʹ-end and micro-RNA processing, and lncRNA function. To address this issue, we propose to develop a genetically encodable Cas-based RNA proximity-labeling strategy to precisely identify proteins that bind in close proximity to a specific RNA sequence. We will then use this approach to identify protein factors involved in regulating microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8) activity at specific primary micro-RNA loci. These research goals fully align with the NIGMS 5 Year Strategic Plan, through the development of essential research tools to study and RNA function for biomedical research. Project Narrative RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas proteins offer an unprecedented opportunity to precisely manipulate RNA biology in ways not currently possible. We propose several innovative approaches to address critical knowledge gaps in CRISPR-Cas tool development and chart a path to use these tools to interrogate several fundamental questions in RNA biology. Our approaches will help us define the gRNA design rules for RNA-targeting Cas proteins, and develop robust new RNA-targeting Cas tools to manipulate RNA splicing and dissect protein- RNA interaction networks, and ultimately, the tools developed here will transform the way we study RNA and will broadly impact the fields of molecular and cell biology.",Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology,9796943,R35GM133462,"['Address', 'Alternative Splicing', 'BCAR1 gene', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Floods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microprocessor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Transcript', 'base', 'clinical application', 'design', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'single cell analysis', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R35,2019,385000,0.06624967078982516
"Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling PROJECT SUMMARY The human body comprises of trillion of cells, which are the building blocks of life. Each cell is highly organized, with various constituents within localizing to specific regions. Location within a cell is a cardinal organizing principle of gene control and function, especially for RNAs that code for proteins or serve regulatory roles as non-coding RNAs. Each cell type has its distinct RNA-species profile, and where these RNAs are located within the cell can dictate their folding, editing, splicing, translation, degradation, binding partners, catalytic activity, and even the fate of the proteins that they encode. Unsurprisingly, perturbations in RNA localization result in disease conditions including cancers and neuropathologies. In spite of the vital importance of subcellular RNA localization in gene expression, investigating such phenomena simultaneously for many RNA species has been challenging. To address these long-standing issues, Dr. Furqan Fazal and others have recently developed a technique called APEX-seq that can track the location of thousands of RNAs in living human cells with high-temporal and nanometer-spatial resolution. APEX-seq has the transformative potential to provide high-resolution snapshots of tens of thousands of endogenous cellular RNA species, free from artifacts of overexpression, cell fixation or recombinant tagging. This proposal outlines a five-year career program for Dr. Fazal as he investigates principles of RNA subcellular localization, and reaches milestone goals that will transition him into an independent investigator. By improving the APEX-seq technique and amalgamating it with a number of cutting-edge tools including massively-parallel reporter assays and deep-learning-based approaches, Dr. Fazal will dissect how sequences within RNAs direct them to different locations, and how cells actively control RNA subcellular localization to regulate gene function. This work will be carried out at Stanford University, where Dr. Fazal will be mentored by Dr. Howard Chang, a pioneer in developing new genomics tools, and Dr. Joanna Wysocka, a leading authority in vertebrate development and non-coding genomic regulatory elements. Both mentors have highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions around the nation and world. Additional support will be available through collaboration with Drs. Shen, Boettiger and Kundaje who will provide training and expertise in genetics, imaging, statistics and computation. An advisory committee comprising of world-leading investigators Drs. Ting, Kool, Li, Bryant and Bassik will also monitor progress and provide expertise. Further acquisition of scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the educational resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Stanford provides an outstanding intellectually-stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success, and all proposed training will complement Dr. Fazal’s previous knowledge in genomics and biophysics and facilitate his transition into a multidisciplinary RNA biologist in the field of spatial transcriptomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many RNA species within a cell are spatially localized and locally translated into proteins, and previous studies in embryos, neurons and highly-dynamic tissues have demonstrated the vital importance of RNA subcellular location in development and cellular function. However, it has been challenging to study localization transcriptome-wide, which has hampered understanding of the extent and role of such processes in normal and diseased tissues. The proposed work will improve a newly-developed tool for the RNA community to investigate spatial transcriptomics, and use it to provide new insights into RNA biology by determining the regulatory sequences (i.e. the grammar) controlling localization, as well as identifying the associated cellular mechanisms.",Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling,9870316,K99HG010910,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Biological Transport', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterochromatin', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Motors', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Envelope', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Nuclear Pore', 'Organelles', 'Outer Mitochondrial Membrane', 'Pattern', 'Peroxidases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Transport', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'active control', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'cell fixation', 'cell type', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education resources', 'experience', 'gene function', 'genomic tools', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanometer', 'neuropathology', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'ribosome profiling', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2019,137214,0.008789320098158629
"The next generation of RNA-Seq simulators for benchmarking analyses Abstract: RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has established itself as the primary method for studying transcription in basic research, with an emerging role in the clinic – currently upwards of 5,000 publications using the technology are indexed in PubMed. However, the interpretation of RNA-Seq requires several complex operations including alignment, quantification, normalization and statistical analyses of various types. Since its inception a large number of algorithms have appeared for each step, creating a very confusing landscape for investigators. In order to determine the best analysis practices, numerous benchmarking studies have emerged which leverage real RNA-Seq data made from well-studied RNA samples, such as the Genetic European Variation in Health and Disease (GEUVADIS) consortium data. These valuable RNA-Seq datasets contain the biases and errors introduced by sequencing biochemistry—factors that any analysis method must account for and overcome. However, the utility of such datasets for benchmarking analysis methods is limited by the fact that we do not know the underlying truth (e.g. the true number of RNA molecules from each transcript in the original sample). Therefore researchers tend to rely heavily on simulated data, since we know everything about the true composition of these samples. There are dozens of DNA simulators aimed at benchmarking applications such as variant calling. And while the need for simulators is just as strong in RNA analysis, there are only a scant few RNA-Seq simulators available. Furthermore, the available RNA- Seq simulators are based on simplifying assumptions that greatly restrict their utility for benchmarking anything but the most upstream steps in the analysis pipeline (e.g. alignment). The further downstream the analysis method is, the more accurately the true nature of real data and its technical biases need to be modeled in order to draw meaningful conclusions. For example, no simulator generates data from a diploid genome, which would be necessary to evaluate allele specific quantification. Given our extensive experience with RNA-Seq analysis and transcriptomics in general, and our success at building the BEERS simulator, and our track record of authorship on all comprehensive RNA-Seq aligner benchmarking studies published to date, we are ideally situated to develop the next generation of open-source RNA-Seq simulator which aims to model all sources of technical variability. Furthermore, the simulator will model biological variability with an empirical approach based on using real data to configure the simulator’s parameters, which is a natural problem for machine learning. There are eleven steps in RNA-Seq library preparation which introduce bias, all of which will be modeled by the software in an object-oriented modular framework. Project Narrative: There have been many algorithms developed for every step of the RNA-Seq analysis pipeline with no easy way to compare between them. Simulated data are useful for this purpose, but to date there are very few RNA-Seq simulators available and all make too many simplifying assumptions to be used for anything but the most upstream steps in the pipeline, e.g. alignment. We propose to develop the next generation of open-source RNA-Seq simulator, which will capture all of the biochemical processes in a modular fashion and model all of the sources of technical variation.",The next generation of RNA-Seq simulators for benchmarking analyses,9730605,R21LM012763,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Authorship', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'European', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequencing Biochemistry', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'indexing', 'next generation', 'open source', 'operation', 'power analysis', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,181125,0.05891873092299387
"Computer Simulations of Enzymes Computer simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) and the combined quantum  mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach are capable of describing structures and dynamics  of proteins and chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. An accurate and  computationally efficient energy function is necessary. However, challenges remain: the  accuracy of QM method, the compatibility between the electron density of the QM subsystem and  classical force fields for the MM subsystem, and the cost of ab initio QM/MM methods capitalizing  on the accuracy and reliability of the associated QM approaches. To address these challenges, we  have developed a series of ab initio QM/MM approaches on reaction path optimizations and free  energy calculations, the QM/MM minimum free-energy path (QM/MM-MFEP) and the QM/MM neural  network (QM/MM-NN) methods. This proposal aims to develop further the ab initio QM/MM methodology  and its applications to the studies of redox processes in important enzymes, and the construction  of ab initio force fields combined with neural network representations. Our long-term goals are to develop and establish accurate first-principles based and density  functional theory (DFT) based MD and QM/MM simulation as an equal partner with experiments for the  study of enzymes and proteins and to provide insight into chemical and redox processes in  biological systems. Our aims are as follows: (1) We aim to make ab initio QM/MM models for much  more accurate QM/MM energies, for the QM description and for the electrostatic and vdW interactions   between the QM and MM subsystems. (2) We aim to develop a combined computational  model to explore the key molecular determinants of the reduction potential variability in  metalloproteins. We will provide detailed insight into chemical and redox reaction mechanisms in  biological systems, in particular laccases. (3) We aim at the development of accurate  force fields of water, and proteins for simulations in biological applications, going beyond the  traditional force field forms and limitation in accuracy. The proposed developments will capitalize on the theoretical developments in quantum  electronic theory, such as the linear response theory and accurate many-electron approach for  non-covalent interactions, and leverage machine-learning methods in data science for biological  system simulations. The proposed work will lead to the major advancement of the ab initio QM/MM  method and force fields, and insights into the structure-function paradigm for proteins  and important redox process and reaction mechanisms in enzymes. In addition, it will also lead to  methodology development for design of new drugs and enzyme inhibitors. Understanding chemical reactions and redox processes in solution and in enzymes is of critical  importance, because the structure-function relationship and the catalytic role of enzymes  are fundamental insights in biochemical research, and they are essential for the development of  new or better inhibitors and enzymes. Quantitative tools such as simulations make key contributions  to the investigation of the structure-function relationship, complementing experimental studies.  This proposal aims at developing methods for simulating structures and dynamics in proteins, and  chemical and redox processes catalyzed by enzymes, and investigating the mechanisms of  important enzymes-copper protein laccases, leading to significant advances in research tools for  studying enzymes and contributing to the understanding of life processes, as well as aiding in the  design of inhibitors and drugs.",Computer Simulations of Enzymes,9818963,R01GM061870,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Biophysical Process', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copper', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Electrons', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Laccase', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metalloproteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Potential Energy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical reaction', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'electron density', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'intermolecular interaction', 'learning strategy', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'neural network', 'novel therapeutics', 'perturbation theory', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,341716,-0.012983730691187466
"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9761970,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2019,1212566,0.000885478368607483
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems.

Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,9965046,R01GM053148,"['ATP Synthesis Pathway', 'Achievement', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amino Acids', 'Anions', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Entropy', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Inorganic Phosphate Transporter', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proton Pump', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Water', 'Wisconsin', 'anti-influenza drug', 'antiporter', 'chemical bond', 'chemical reaction', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'multi drug transporter', 'novel', 'pH gradient', 'protonation', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'symporter', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2019,109700,-0.005574085356217669
"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating information about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commercial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to formalizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to become the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  CDD will first develop the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. The most innovative part of the project and the bulk of the effort will be to develop a sophisticated automated translation tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that MInChI can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxicology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicology of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,9826639,R43TR002528,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Government', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shorthand', 'Solvents', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'consumer product', 'data structure', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R43,2019,54833,-0.004868826437620909
"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes Project Summary RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection.

"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in drug discovery rely on the development of novel effective computational methodologies. This proposal advances an efficient and robust computational workflow for structure-based virtual screening of very large chemical libraries.

"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9759968,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'engineered T cells', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'immunoglobulin structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2019,321795,-0.03713673584886653
"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,9740714,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,312660,-0.014814832471888006
"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,9732293,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kidney fibrosis', 'kinase inhibitor', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,31648,-0.04413848632079397
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9774233,R01GM123314,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'K-562', 'K562 Cells', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Location', 'MALAT1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Recognition Motif', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Running', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'deep sequencing', 'differential expression', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive tools', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2019,303137,-0.019508454242437422
"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9634985,R01GM108340,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'lead optimization', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,313000,-0.035214657235587477
"Computational Methods to Characterize Alternative Splicing from Massive Collections of RNA-seq Data SUMMARY Alternative splicing (AS) is a gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human biology and disease. High throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) is making it possible to survey the expressed genes and their alternative splicing variations in a wide variety of cellular conditions. However, the short reads are challenging to analyze, demanding highly sophisticated computational methods that can extract meaningful AS information efficiently, accurately, and in a comprehensive way. While there has been great progress so far, current methods based on assembling the short reads into transcript annotations have reached a plateau. We propose two innovations that can help overcome the limits. The first is one-step simultaneous analyses of multiple samples in an RNA-seq collection, in contrast with the current two-step approach that analyzes each sample separately and then merges the results. The second is to create and interrogate assembly-free representations of AS. The project will design a suite of tools that will leverage the latent information in large collections of samples and from heterogeneous data types to build complete and accurate AS signatures of tissues and cell types, and to elucidate the regulatory circuitry of AS and its functional implications. Aim 1 will develop a high- performance multi-sample transcript assembly tool, combining subexon graph representations of genes and AS variations, statistical methods for improved feature detection, and search space reduction techniques for efficient sample processing. Aim 2 will build highly efficient and accurate feature selection tools to detect and characterize assembly-free AS variations (subexons and introns), simultaneously from collections of RNA-seq samples. It will combine novel regularized programs with complex models of intronic `noise' and other RNA-seq confounders, and enable analyses of differential splicing and to identify individual and group-specific variations. Lastly, Aim 3 will develop a system to comprehensively model the regulatory and functional circuitry of AS and the effects of mutations, starting from deep learning models of sequences and alignments and integrating expression, sequence, epigenetic and mutation data across tissues, cell types and conditions. We will rigorously test and evaluate all tools in simulations and on large public data sets, as well as on thyroid and head and neck cancer data provided by our collaborators, and we will experimentally validate random subsets of predictions with capillary electrophoresis and qRT-PCR. Collectively, the concepts, methods and tools will establish a new framework for analyzing RNA-seq data that can efficiently tackle the `big data' challenges, leading to more complete discovery and annotation of AS structure and function in human health and disease.   NARRATIVE Alternative splicing is a fundamental gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human physiology and disease. Next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is making it possible to characterize alternative splicing in great detail, however, current bioinformatics analysis tools miss important variations. The project will design a suite of innovative tools that criss-cross information across multiple RNA-seq samples, and across heterogeneous sequence, epigenetic and expression data, to more comprehensively and more accurately determine the structure, function and regulation of alternative splicing in human biology and disease.",Computational Methods to Characterize Alternative Splicing from Massive Collections of RNA-seq Data,9817658,R01GM129085,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Bypass', 'Capillary Electrophoresis', 'Charge', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Farming environment', 'Follicular thyroid carcinoma', 'Galaxy', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Graph', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'International', 'Introns', 'Learning Module', 'Length', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spliced Genes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Thyroid carcinoma', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'data reduction', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feature detection', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'prototype', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'simulation', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,363164,0.009143251876179571
"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Mapping the Secondary Metabolomes of Marine Cyanobacteria Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways. However, the complete structure elucidation of natural products is often the most time consuming and costly endeavor in natural product drug discovery programs. Compounding this, advancements in genome sequencing have accelerated the identification of unique modular biosynthetic gene clusters in prokaryotes and revealed a wealth of new compounds yet to be isolated and biologically and chemically characterized. Resultantly, there is an urgent and continuing need in this field to connect biosynthetic gene clusters to their respective MS fragmentation signatures in the MS2 molecular networks. The capacity to make such connections will accelerate new compound discovery as well as create associations between gene cluster and biosynthetic pathway, and aid in fast and accurate structure elucidations. Combined with this informatics approach, this proposed continuation project explores innovative methods by which to solve complex molecular structures by enhanced MS and NMR experiments, as well as the development of new algorithms by which to accelerate their analysis. Thus, the overarching goal of this grant is to develop efficient methods that facilitate automated structural classification, structural feature discovery and ultimately efficient structure elucidation of natural products (or any small molecule) and to build an infrastructure that interacts with data input from the community. We will achieve this with the following four specific aims: Aim 1. Integration of MS2 molecular networking with gene cluster networking to rapidly and efficiently locate natural products that have unique molecular architectures; Aim 2. To develop a suite of high sensitivity pulse sequences for natural product structure elucidation; Aim 3. To develop NMR based molecular networking strategies using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to facilitate the categorization and structure elucidation of organic compounds; Aim 4. To integrate NMR molecular networking and MS2-based molecular networking as an efficient structure characterization and elucidation strategy. By achieving these aims we will develop an innovative workflow for finding new compounds and for determining their structures, both quickly and accurately. The connection between gene cluster and molecule will shed light on stereochemistry and potential halogenations and methylations. This information can then be used in combination with more efficient NMR and MS methods to accurately determine structures. These tools will be widely shared, such as through the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Network, to enhance the overall capacity of the natural products and organic chemistry communities to solve complex molecular structures.   Natural products are compounds produced by natural sources and about 50 % of FDA approved drugs can trace their origin back to natural products. This proposal aims to use our data set of natural products produced by cyanobacteria for development of analytical tools that will speed- up and stream-line the discovery and structure elucidation of new compounds.  ",Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products,9690083,R01GM107550,"['Algae', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Light', 'Marines', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'analog', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'genome sequencing', 'halogenation', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'small molecule', 'social', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,530377,-0.006796157378288696
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy, and are sensitive both to the functional groups that are present and to their detailed geometries and chemical environment. As such these NMR measurements could be used to develop protein structures with a quality equivalent to high resolution X-ray crystallography but in their native aqueous environments. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this proposal, we will develop a new, first principles quantum mechanical (QM) based approach to simulation of NMR spectral observables for condensed phase biomolecules and bio-organics. Rapid prototyping of new QM methods will be enabled by the development of a distinctive in-silico NMR laboratory that applies finite magnetic fields and nuclear spins. From this capability, new methods for chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings will emerge that offer improved accuracy versus cost tradeoffs, and will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein relevant and energetically accessible environments. With such data, both artificial neural networks and Bayesian supervised learning approaches will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting eQMCalculator will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and creation of structural ensembles for IDPs. Project Title: High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments. This proposal aims to significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or IDP ensemble of structures, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,9633923,U01GM121667,"['Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Magnetism', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Phase', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantum Theory', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Solvents', 'Statistical Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'aqueous', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cost', 'database structure', 'drug structure', 'experimental study', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic field', 'personalized approach', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'response', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vibration']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2019,294912,-0.04981488421842223
"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) “rule learning”, which abstracts the underlying “rules” by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas.

"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well. In contrast our mathematical methods will directly produce new antibody designs by learning from large-scale experiments that test antibodies for function against disease targets. !",Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences,9520706,R01CA218094,"['Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Fc Receptor', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunize', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Machines', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phage Display', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical methods', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive test', 'receptor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,591130,0.00774745683278893
"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data.

"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data.

"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9406318,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,356625,-0.00988209307944598
"Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria Project Summary/Abstract Fungal and bacterial pathogens are a major threat to human health. Few therapeutics exist to treat fungal infections while bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to existing therapeutics. Humans have been using natural products to treat infections for thousands of years, long before the causal agents of infection were understood. Natural products have continued to be used as therapeutics in the modern age of medicine. Rates of rediscovery of known natural products have increased in traditional sources of natural products, such as soil bacteria. Recently, symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems have been recognized as a promising source of bioactive compounds, especially antifungal agents. These bacteria often produce natural products that defend an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use chemical biology approaches such as phenotypic interaction screens, genomics, and a new bioinformatics approach to systematically search for bioactive natural products produced by Actinobacteria symbionts and other organisms in insect agricultural systems. The first part of this proposal focuses on using existing techniques to identify new bioactive natural products. Phenotypic interaction screens can identify bioactive natural products by determining if a symbiotic bacteria produces a natural product that inhibits the growth of a fungal pathogen and vice-versa. We will then use genomic sequencing, bioinformatics, and heterologous expression to identify and characterize biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are not expressed in the phenotypic interaction screens. The second part of the proposed work involves the use of a new bioinformatics technique to identify interesting bioactive natural products. Existing bioinformatics techniques identify BGCs and predict the most likely chemical structure of the corresponding natural product. However, they do not conclude anything concerning the functional role that the natural product plays. The technique developed here will use machine learning to predict the function that the natural product fulfills in the ecological context of the organism. This algorithm will facilitate the identification of bioactive natural products with therapeutically relevant functions. Project Narrative Fungal infections are an underappreciated threat to human health with high mortality rates and few effective therapeutic agents for treatment. Symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems are a promising source of antifungal agents since they often produce natural products with antifungal activity protecting an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use phenotypic interaction screens, genome sequencing, and the development of a novel bioinformatics method to systematically mine Actinobacteria for antifungal and antibacterial products – leading to the discovery of new bioactive small molecules along with a deeper understanding of how natural products mediate the interaction between species in insect agricultural systems.",Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria,9540546,F32GM128267,"['Actinobacteria class', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Ants', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Breathing', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Insecta', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mycoses', 'Natural Products', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Soil', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bioactive natural products', 'drug discovery', 'fungus', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'post-doctoral training', 'prediction algorithm', 'small molecule', 'symbiont']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F32,2018,58282,0.0059051090885112005
"Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a novel approach based on deep learning neural networks to encode molecules into chemically rich vectors. We will first apply this representation to build more powerful computational models that can more accurately predict properties such as bioactivity, ADME/ Tox, and pharmacokinetics across libraries of molecular structures. The ultimate goal is to leverage this repre- sentation to generate novel compounds with better combinations of properties. Both of these capabilities will help scientists to accelerate discovery of new drugs broadly across many therapeutic areas.  Scientists engaged in drug discovery research from academic laboratories to large pharmaceutical companies rely on computational QSAR models to predict pharmacologically relevant properties and obviate the need to perform expensive, time-consuming assays (many of which require animal studies) for every molecule of interest. Some properties (e.g. logP) can now be modeled with such high confidence that the models have replaced the need to perform the assays, but many other critical properties (e.g. solubility, ADME, PK, hERG) remain far from this goal. We expect that our proposed chemically rich vectors will significantly advance the state of the art beyond what can be achieved with conventional descriptors and fingerprints. Improved models will enable researchers to select lead candidate series more effectively, explore chemical space around leads to generate novel IP more efficiently, reduce failure rates for compounds advancing through the drug discovery pipeline, and accelerate the entire drug discovery process. These benefits will be realized broadly across most therapeutic areas.  Our central innovation is a novel computational strategy: first develop a deep learning (DL) model optimized to best capture the essential structural and chemical features of molecules, starting from the most natural structural representation; then validate the DL model by applying it to improve QSAR modeling of pharmacological properties; and finally extend it to generate previously unknown molecules that have superior properties – the so-called “inverse QSAR” problem, which is the Holy Grail of computational medicinal chemistry. Others have unsuccessfully tried to leap directly to solve the inverse QSAR problem. We propose a more patient and methodical approach that will allow the neural network to perform self-supervised training to learn about chemical structures and properties from readily available, extremely large datasets, then transfer this learning to improve modeling; only after establishing this solid foundation do we intend to apply the models to attempt inverse QSAR. Prior attempts in this area have also relied on neural network architectures designed originally for language processing. We will design a new architecture, more akin to neural network architectures that have proven most successful at image classification, and optimize it to directly process the “molecular graph” that represents the relationship of atoms and bonds in molecules. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to understand whether potential new drugs are likely to be both safe and effective, and identify similar compounds that are likely to be safer and more effective against the same target. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. !",Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts,9612249,R43TR002527,"['Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Bank', 'Molecular Structure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Solubility', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'computational chemistry', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'learning strategy', 'molecular vector', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'vector', 'voice recognition']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R43,2018,149830,-0.019815099197269977
"Assay Classifier Engine (ACE) for enhancing splice sensor assay performance SUMMARY:  The goal of this proposal is to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the Spinach-based splice sensor platform by developing a novel multiprobe (MP) assay design and a companion machine learning-based classification algorithm called assay classifier engine (ACE). Improvement in sensitivity and specificity of the splice sensor platform enables its application to detect endogenous RNA isoforms with low copy number and distinguish alternative RNA isoforms that share high degree of sequence similarities.  The aim of any assay development effort is to achieve excellent assay specificity and sensitivity. However, this is often a futile endeavor since specificity and sensitivity are two inversely correlated factors. The underlying reason for poor sensitivity or specificity is due to the off-target signals generated by competing molecules present in the sample. In the field of diagnostics, one of the ways these issues are addressed is to perform multiple single probe testing instead of one single probe testing. While individual singe probe assays might have poor specificity and sensitivity, when combined, these assays synergistically improve the sensitivity and specificity of the ultimate diagnostic determination. In the field of research and drug discovery, researchers have employed a multitude of strategies (e.g. signal amplification, reaction cascades, or sample enrichment) to improve sensitivity and MP design or strand displacement strategies to improve specificity. Some of the PCR- based methods have combined both enzyme-based signal amplification and MP strategies to improve assay determination. However, when it comes to detecting targets that are highly similar to their competitors, such as detecting single nucleotide polymorphism, DNA methylation, RNA modification and alternative splicing, there is still an unmet need for more sensitive and specific analytical methods.  In the past few years, Lucerna has developed Spinach-based sensors to detect intractable metabolites and biomolecules. One such sensor is the splice sensor, which is a Spinach-based sensor that can generate fluorescence signal based on the alternative RNA isoform of interest. One of the challenges encountered during splice sensor assay development is the lack of sensitivity toward low copy number RNA isoforms and low specificity when distinguishing two splice isoforms that share a high sequence similarity. To overcome this challenge in this proposal, we will develop a MP assay panel comprised of splice sensor variants that recognize the target RNA and the competitor with varying binding affinities and differing signal responses. We will use data sets generated from the MP assay to train a ML-based ACE algorithm to make target determination in test samples. Further, we will develop a quantitative MP data set and re-train the ACE algorithm to classify the assay signals into various categories based on target concentrations in the test sample. This new ACE algorithm will then be tested against conventional single probe assays to determine specificity and sensitivity improvement of the MP assay platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Improved specificity and sensitivity are highly sought-after features in assays where there are high similarity between the target and its competitors or when the target exists naturally in very low abundance. To address this unmet need, we will develop a fluorescence sensor-based multiprobe assay approach and a companion machine learning-based assay classifier engine (ACE). The ACE algorithm will integrate the multiprobe assay data and classify them based on trained machine learning models to make sample determination with enhanced specificity, sensitivity, and dynamic range than possible with conventional single probe assays.",Assay Classifier Engine (ACE) for enhancing splice sensor assay performance,9622514,R43GM130258,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area Under Curve', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Companions', 'Custom', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reaction', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'Spinach - dietary', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'aptamer', 'assay development', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'sensor', 'targeted biomarker']",NIGMS,"LUCERNA, INC.",R43,2018,224925,0.001258695260057654

"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards. Results from these studies will contribute to the goal of understanding diseases, and the tools and resources will be made publically available for biomedical researchers.",Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core,9589783,U2CES030170,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Attributes of Chemicals', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Isotopes', 'Libraries', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Phase', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Supercomputing', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemical property', 'chemical standard', 'comparative', 'computational chemistry', 'computerized tools', 'dark matter', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'ion mobility', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'quantum chemistry', 'small molecule libraries', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIEHS,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U2C,2018,1076717,0.03333672147143987
"An automated pipeline for macromolecular structure discovery in cellular  electron cryo-tomography SUMMARY – OVERALL Cellular cryo-tomography has emerged as a critical tool for the visualization and structural study of the molecular nanomachines at the heart of cellular function. Although the basic electron cryo-tomography technique has been used for several decades, the technology is being revolutionized by recent advances in sample preparation, electron cryo-microscopy hardware, improved capabilities for automatic data collection, direct electron detection imaging devices, and phase plate technologies. Combined, these advances led to the ability to generate extraordinarily large numbers of cellular cryo-tomograms of exquisite quality. In principle, such large data sets offer insights into cellular variation in disease states as well as better insights into basic cellular function, opening new possibilities for studying the underpinnings of health and disease at the finest possible level, potentially leading to completely new diagnostics for cancer and other cell-altering diseases. However, collection of cellular data is now at a far faster rate than can currently be analyzed with existing methods, producing a serious barrier to progress: to match the data production rates of a single laboratory, at least 50 experienced scientists would need to handle the data analysis. The primary goal of this Program Project is to establish quantitative and highly automated tools for the reconstruction and interpretation of highly complex cellular tomographic data. We have assembled a highly synergistic team of PIs with complimentary expertise in cutting-edge computational and experimental electron microscopy techniques to achieve this goal through collaborative efforts. Project 1 (Hanein & Penczek) focuses on development and implementation of tomogram quality assessment and validation techniques and on experimentally guided optimization of data collection strategies. Project 2 focuses on automatic tomographic reconstruction technology, extraction of various features from the tomograms, and the analysis of distribution patterns derived from the extracted features. Project 3 focuses on development of quantitative tools for tomogram annotation through deep learning and sub-tomogram alignment as well as interactive visualization tools. The set of highly automated tools developed in this Program Project will permit us to interpret 5–10x as much data as is possible using existing methods, greatly expanding the types of cellular variations we can effectively study. NARRATIVE Cellular cryo-tomography has emerged as a critical tool for the visualization and structural study of the molecular nanomachines at the heart of cellular function and—with recent instrumental advances—it is now possible to image hundreds of cells per months, enabling collection of cellular data at a far faster rate than can currently be analyzed.

"The next generation of RNA-Seq simulators for benchmarking analyses Abstract: RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has established itself as the primary method for studying transcription in basic research, with an emerging role in the clinic – currently upwards of 5,000 publications using the technology are indexed in PubMed. However, the interpretation of RNA-Seq requires several complex operations including alignment, quantification, normalization and statistical analyses of various types. Since its inception a large number of algorithms have appeared for each step, creating a very confusing landscape for investigators. In order to determine the best analysis practices, numerous benchmarking studies have emerged which leverage real RNA-Seq data made from well-studied RNA samples, such as the Genetic European Variation in Health and Disease (GEUVADIS) consortium data. These valuable RNA-Seq datasets contain the biases and errors introduced by sequencing biochemistry—factors that any analysis method must account for and overcome. However, the utility of such datasets for benchmarking analysis methods is limited by the fact that we do not know the underlying truth (e.g. the true number of RNA molecules from each transcript in the original sample). Therefore researchers tend to rely heavily on simulated data, since we know everything about the true composition of these samples. There are dozens of DNA simulators aimed at benchmarking applications such as variant calling. And while the need for simulators is just as strong in RNA analysis, there are only a scant few RNA-Seq simulators available. Furthermore, the available RNA- Seq simulators are based on simplifying assumptions that greatly restrict their utility for benchmarking anything but the most upstream steps in the analysis pipeline (e.g. alignment). The further downstream the analysis method is, the more accurately the true nature of real data and its technical biases need to be modeled in order to draw meaningful conclusions. For example, no simulator generates data from a diploid genome, which would be necessary to evaluate allele specific quantification. Given our extensive experience with RNA-Seq analysis and transcriptomics in general, and our success at building the BEERS simulator, and our track record of authorship on all comprehensive RNA-Seq aligner benchmarking studies published to date, we are ideally situated to develop the next generation of open-source RNA-Seq simulator which aims to model all sources of technical variability. Furthermore, the simulator will model biological variability with an empirical approach based on using real data to configure the simulator’s parameters, which is a natural problem for machine learning. There are eleven steps in RNA-Seq library preparation which introduce bias, all of which will be modeled by the software in an object-oriented modular framework. Project Narrative: There have been many algorithms developed for every step of the RNA-Seq analysis pipeline with no easy way to compare between them. Simulated data are useful for this purpose, but to date there are very few RNA-Seq simulators available and all make too many simplifying assumptions to be used for anything but the most upstream steps in the pipeline, e.g. alignment. We propose to develop the next generation of open-source RNA-Seq simulator, which will capture all of the biochemical processes in a modular fashion and model all of the sources of technical variation.",The next generation of RNA-Seq simulators for benchmarking analyses,9600808,R21LM012763,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Authorship', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'European', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequencing Biochemistry', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'indexing', 'next generation', 'open source', 'operation', 'power analysis', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2018,217350,0.05891873092299387
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9486312,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2018,1527746,0.000885478368607483
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,9543037,R01GM053148,"['ATP Synthesis Pathway', 'Achievement', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amino Acids', 'Anions', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Entropy', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Inorganic Phosphate Transporter', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proton Pump', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Water', 'Wisconsin', 'anti-influenza drug', 'antiporter', 'chemical bond', 'chemical reaction', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'multi drug transporter', 'novel', 'pH gradient', 'protonation', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'symporter', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2018,310328,-0.005574085356217669
"Structure-based prediction of the interactome Supplement Summary “Structure-based prediction of the interactome” NIH R01GM081871-10 PI: Bonnie Berger We have designed and implemented a system for privacy-preserving and scalable sharing of drug-target interaction data (Aim 1, under review at Science), where we required GPUs to run our protocol, discover and experimentally validate novel drug-target interactions and will make our software publicly-available for academic and non-profit use (Aim 3). At the same time, we have presented a novel loss function for training classifiers from positive and unlabeled data and developed a software pipeline, Topaz, which uses convolutional neural networks trained with few positive examples for protein detection (Aim 2, RECOMB 2018). We are now developing new deep learning models for protein structure embedding and extending the Topaz framework to learn a general deep learning model of protein images from multiple cryo-EM micrograph datasets. Our continued progress on these projects is significantly jeopardized by our lack of GPU compute power. While in the last year we have purchased a compute node with four GPUs, we are continually frustrated by wait-times and inability to try different models and hyperparameters. Thus, we are requesting an additional node with eight GPUs to enable us to reach the broader goals of our grant. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data. Here, we develop new mathematical methods and software that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning can accelerate the drug discovery process.",Structure-based prediction of the interactome,9703262,R01GM081871,"['Address', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cryptography', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'loss of function', 'mathematical methods', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'protein structure', 'small molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,83700,-0.055031351957049966
"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9535392,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'human disease', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2018,552994,0.040964687187462656
"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating information about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commercial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to formalizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to become the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  CDD will first develop the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. The most innovative part of the project and the bulk of the effort will be to develop a sophisticated automated translation tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that MInChI can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxicology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases.

"Novel Nanopore-based RNA Sequencing using Nucleobase-specific Tags Project Summary Cost-effective, and accurate sequencing of RNA, composed of both canonical and modified bases, of any length, without conversion to cDNA, and without amplification are the objectives of this project, and the ultimate goal is to sequence the transcriptome, and determine in a time-sensitive manner relative distribution of its components. Such accomplishment will directly impact prevention, diagnosis, and cure of disease and materialize the promise of personalized medicine. Current methods, such as Illumina's RNA-Seq, and the single molecule approaches of Pacific Biosciences and of Oxford Nanopore Technologies, still lag behind in many of the critical attributes mentioned above. The unresolved issue with nanopore-based sequencing is the observation that ion current vs. time recording does not refer to a single nucleobase, but to a short sequence of 4 or more bases. The problem, partially resolved with the use of sophisticated algorithms and learning machines, appears intractable for RNA that includes numerous post-transcriptional base modifications. As an illustration, if a nanopore reads a sequence of 4 bases and the specific RNA to be sequenced has a total of 8 different nucleobases (4 canonical and 4 modified), then 48 = 65,536 signals need to be discriminated from within an ion current range of 20 to 40 pA with a standard deviation of ±1 pA; this is an impossible computational task. However, if the nanopore could sense one base at a time and yield distinct ion current for each base, there will be only 8 different recordings to distinguish from, a much simpler task. Our own published results indicate that oligodeoxynucleotides conjugated with a pyrimidine-specific tag (Osmium tetroxide 2,2'-bipyrimidine or OsBp) yield enzyme-free, slow/readable translocation via α- Hemolysin, and distinct ion current levels for intact, T(OsBp), and C(OsBp) bases, suggesting that a single tag can yield sequencing information on purine, T, and C. The latter leads to the conjecture that the presence of a second, purine-specific, label would allow identification of all four canonical bases. Furthermore each tag has intrinsic selectivity for one base over another, and this will provide a handle for additional discrimination among the modified bases. In this phase I proposal we aim to demonstrate (i) near 100% labeling (true positives) with 0% internucleotide bond cleavage, and 0% false positives for RNA(OsBp), as we have already shown for DNA(OsBp), (ii) comparable labeling attributes for a purine-specific tag, and (iii) readable translocation with single pyrimidine base discrimination for RNA(OsBp). Success in these efforts will lead to single base discrimination and sequencing of RNA, including a number of post-transcriptionally modified bases, and pave the road for sequencing the transcriptome. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in personalized medicine for diagnosis and treatment of disease require sequencing the RNA transcriptome with technologies that are currently unavailable. Nanopore-systems that exhibit single-base discrimination, like the one addressed in this proposal, will allow sequencing the transcriptome in an accurate, timely, and cost-effective manner.",Novel Nanopore-based RNA Sequencing using Nucleobase-specific Tags,9506880,R43HG010051,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Belief', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cells', 'Complementary DNA', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Exhibits', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hemolysin', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Osmium Tetroxide', 'Phase', 'Platinum', 'Platinum Compounds', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Purines', 'Pyrimidine', 'Pyrimidines', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Readability', 'Residual state', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transfer RNA', 'VDAC1 gene', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'constriction', 'cost effective', 'design', 'improved', 'nanopore', 'new technology', 'novel', 'nucleobase', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'single molecule', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,"YENOS ANALYTICAL, LLC",R43,2018,280000,0.03182632313420749
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity. This study has the potential to lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of many diseases.","PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site",9394010,U24DK112331,"['ATAC-seq', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'New York', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Research Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'data resource', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'fitness', 'gene product', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput analysis', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual response', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'methylome', 'mortality', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sedentary', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web page', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2018,1639153,0.014212973781656344
"A Systems Biology Approach to Investigate the Structure Changes of Biological Network Project Summary/Abstract Networks have been widely used to describe many biological processes. Understanding the structure of biological network, especially regulatory network, will provide a key to discovering the mechanisms underlying important biological processes and pathogenesis of diseases. One of the most challenging tasks in systems biology is how to correctly reconstruct the networks from the high-dimensional data generated by modern genomic technology. Most network inference methods assume the network structure is time-invariant. Some recent studies revealed the structures of some biological networks are non-stationary or time-varying. For example, the neural information flow networks of brains are changing during learning process. Importantly, cancer studies found the native T cells would be converted into senescent T cells due to the structure changes of genetic network during tumorigenesis. The stationary network inference methods can't be used to reconstruct the time-varying network. Non-stationary network inference methods are urgently needed to investigate the time-varying networks at different stages. Some researchers have attempted to develop some time-varying network inference methods. However, the inferred networks using existing methods are only correlation or causality graphs, not regulatory networks which require activation & inhibition information. This project aims to develop novel non-stationary network inference methods to reconstruct time-varying regulatory networks from time series data. Since the networks are highly complex, it is not realistic to manually verify large networks as being used by the traditional methods. We will develop a powerful Model Checker, which is a Turing Award winning technique for hardware system verification, to intelligently verify the inferred time-varying networks. Our long-term goal is to integrate the statistical inference and model checking techniques in a unified platform to automatically reconstruct and verify time-varying networks. This integrative systems biology approach will make the large-network inference and verification automatic, intelligent and efficient. Recent cancer studies show that, restoring senescent T cells represents a promising strategy for cancer treatment. In collaboration with cancer immunologist, we will apply computational-experimental approaches to investigate what structure changes of the genetic network and how they induce T-cell's functional changes and influence its fate decision making from naive T-cells to senescent T-cells. Answering these questions will significantly improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the T cell differentiation during tumorigenesis. Public Health Relevance/Narrative This project aims to develop a novel systems biology approach to reconstruct the time-varying biological networks from high-dimensional data in collaboration with the cancer immunologist. The proposed research has relevance to public health, because it seeks to investigate what and how the structure changes of genetic network induce the T-cell's functional changes during tumorigenesis, which will ultimately improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the T cell differentiation and cancer.",A Systems Biology Approach to Investigate the Structure Changes of Biological Network,9655801,R15GM129696,"['Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Gene Structure', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Immunologist', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Muscle Development', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T cell differentiation', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computer studies', 'exhaust', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'senescence', 'tool', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis']",NIGMS,SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY,R15,2018,454500,-0.01880963347171462
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9595902,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2018,321985,-0.03713673584886653
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues.

"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9419924,R01GM108340,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'lead optimization', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,312167,-0.035214657235587477
"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,9607906,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Hospitalization', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kinase inhibitor', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,31156,-0.04413848632079397
"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Mapping the Secondary Metabolomes of Marine Cyanobacteria Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways. However, the complete structure elucidation of natural products is often the most time consuming and costly endeavor in natural product drug discovery programs. Compounding this, advancements in genome sequencing have accelerated the identification of unique modular biosynthetic gene clusters in prokaryotes and revealed a wealth of new compounds yet to be isolated and biologically and chemically characterized.

"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data.

"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9260548,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alpha Cell', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,356625,-0.00988209307944598
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems. The results of our fundamental research will be new computer codes for modeling macromolecular assemblies, the structures of which facilitate the prediction of medically relevant functions.",Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy,9306122,R01GM062968,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin Fiber', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Filaments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Filament', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hair Cells', 'Health', 'Hydration status', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Motors', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Plant Resins', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tomogram', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'computer code', 'cryogenics', 'density', 'design', 'fiber cell', 'fitness', 'fundamental research', 'high standard', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'macromolecular assembly', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tomography', 'tool']",NIGMS,OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,306527,-0.016965764403025753
"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design A fundamental challenge to translate insights between biomedical researchers, who study biological mechanisms, and clinicians, who diagnose patient symptoms, is that many links between biological processes and disease pathophysiology are poorly understood. A comprehensive Biomedical Translator must enable chains of inference across objects as diverse as genetic mutations, molecular effects, tissue-specific expression patterns, cellular processes, organ phenotypes, disease states, patient symptoms, and drug responses, a challenge beyond the scope of any one organization. Fortunately, many individual links in this chain have been made by experiments yielding statistical connections between individual data types. High-throughput perturbation screens link chemical and genetic perturbations to cellular phenotypes such as gene-expression patterns, cell survival, or changes in phosphorylation. Genetic association studies link mutations to human disease or intermediate phenotypes and biomarkers. Electronic medical records (EMR) link diseases or human phenotypes to diagnostic or current procedural terminology (CPT) codes, and clinical trials link the impact of drugs and drug candidates on disease states. In principle, incorporating these links into chains of inference could translate results between the full set of data types within them. In practice, each link is maintained by experts with domain-specific experiments, semantic terminology, and methodological standards. While a key challenge faced by a global Biomedical Translator is to establish consistent standards across these existing data types, a more important goal is to develop a principled and robust framework to (a) model biological systems and experimental approaches to investigate them; (b) organize knowledge about biological mechanism and disease; and (c) incorporate diverse datasets that serve as windows into the underlying and unknown state of nature. We propose to implement a Biomedical Translator as a probabilistic graphical model, a paradigm from artificial intelligence (AI) research. Just as separate research communities form weakly coupled parts of the translation process, graphical models allow global inferences from weakly coupled “nodes”. These inferences require each node to publish only probability distributions, enabling interoperability without necessarily having global entity-resolution standards, and benefit from paradigms for quality control, fault tolerance, and relevance assessment common in AI research. We hypothesize that a limited number of APIs, implemented as probability computations by communities around the world, would yield a Biomedical Translator as an emergent property of weakly coupled knowledge sources. From basic properties of graphical models, such a Translator could probabilistically translate among any data types connected within it, allowing for relatively complex query concepts. For example: What cellular processes in which tissues are impacted in a patient-based EMR? What genetic mutations sensitize cells to small-molecule treatment effects? Which small molecules mimic genetic “experiments of nature” that protect against disease? To illustrate the value of these resources and our architectural paradigm, we propose a demonstration project to implement a Biomedical Translator supporting queries between small molecules, biological processes, genes, and disease. The demonstration project will provide a valuable first step to confront key data-integration and organizational challenges and will enable previously impossible queries, such as identifying small molecules that perturb the same biological processes implicated by human genetics in a disease context. In this capacity, such Translator could realistically identify existing drugs for known symptoms (i.e., repurposing), but could more broadly serve as an engine for hypothesis generation and biological discovery, suggesting pre-clinical small molecules to develop based on their observed biological activity, or providing heretofore novel links between cellular protein function and disease pathophysiology. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9540181,OT3TR002025,"['Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Current Procedural Terminology Codes', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Probability', 'Processed Genes', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'Terminology', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translation Process', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical genetics', 'data integration', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'protein function', 'response', 'small molecule', 'treatment effect']",NCATS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",OT3,2017,651119,-5.4120396592414376e-05
"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9320692,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2017,552994,0.040964687187462656
"Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers for Heterogeneous Glioblastomas PROJECT SUMMARY  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant form of brain tumors with more than 18,000 newly diagnosed patients and 13,000 deaths annually in the United States. The prognosis for GBM remains dismal with a median survival time of GBM patients of 14 to 16 months after diagnosis. A hallmark of malignant GBM is their high heterogeneity within the tumors. This unique characteristic manifests to molecular subtypes of GBM that display unique patterns of pathogenesis, biology, and prognosis. While specific molecular markers are of value in clinical care (e.g., IDH1/2 mutations, 1p/19q co-deletion), significant improvement in prognostic stratification and targeted therapeutics are urgently needed. With the ultimate goal of realizing the full potential of personalized and precision medicine, we propose to interrogate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in a cohort of clinical GBM specimens. LncRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that have emerged as critical modulators in various cellular processes through gene regulation. Previous studies including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), though limited by their profiling technique not designed for non-coding RNAs, have suggested that lncRNAs are abundant in human cancers and are highly cancer-type-specific. In particular, lncRNAs have been implicated in brain function and glioma development. Specifically, in this exploratory project, we will apply the Ribo-Zero-based transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) to comprehensively characterize lncRNAs in 100 clinical GBM samples that have been collected at the Northwestern University Brain Tumor Tissue Bank (Aim 1a). In contrast to the oligo(dT)-based RNA-seq that was used by previous studies, including TCGA, the Ribo-Zero-based technique is optimized for non-coding RNA transcripts, thus offering a great advantage for profiling all potentially functional lncRNAs in GBM. Notably, a novel detection algorithm based on machine learning will be developed to provide a more flexible and universal framework of lncRNA detection using RNA-seq. Though restricted to those lncRNAs shared between our GBM data and the oligo(dT)-based TCGA, we will evaluate the tissue-specificity of lncRNAs detected in GBM using TCGA data on several solid tumors (Aim 1b). After characterizing the landscape of lncRNAs in GBM, we will evaluate whether lncRNAs are associated with the clinical outcomes of GBM patients, and evaluate the feasibility of integrating lncRNAs and gene-level transcripts into a prognostic tool (Aim 2a). This proposal will enable us to employ these novel biomarkers for the prognosis of GBM as well as future functional studies. In addition, we will utilize co-expression network analysis to assign functions to the detected lncRNAs in GBM. An integrated, internet-based catalog will be constructed to provide a resource of lncRNAs in GBM that will benefit the general research community in this new area (Aim 2b). Finally, the PIs have assembled an outstanding research team with significant achievements in relevant research areas and complimentary expertise, therefore ensuring the success of this multidisciplinary and highly innovative project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This work seeks to understand whether long non-coding RNAs implicate in the prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a form of malignant brain tumors. By characterizing these novel gene regulatory molecules in GBM, we expect to identify novel biomarkers that can be used as a prognostic tool for patients with GBM. This approach could also be applied to other human cancers.",Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers for Heterogeneous Glioblastomas,9321295,R21CA209345,"['19q', 'Achievement', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nucleotides', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Inactivation', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'flexibility', 'gene function', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'molecular subtypes', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'oligo (dT)', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2017,165732,-0.016008918839847706

"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in drug discovery rely on the development of novel effective computational methodologies. This proposal advances an efficient and robust computational workflow for structure-based virtual screening of very large chemical libraries.

"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9398667,R01GM123314,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alpha Cell', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animal Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'K-562', 'K562 Cells', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Location', 'MALAT1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Recognition Motif', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Running', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'deep sequencing', 'differential expression', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive tools', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2017,326862,-0.019508454242437422
"Development of integrative models for early liver toxicity assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational toxicology has become a critical area of research due to the burgeoning need to evaluate thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals with unknown toxicity profiles, the high demand in time and resources by current experimental toxicity testing, and the growing ethical concerns over animal use in toxicity studies. Despite tremendous efforts, little success has been attained thus far in the development of predictive computational models for toxicity, primarily due to the complexity of toxicity mechanisms as well as the lack of high-quality experimental data for model development.  A critical challenge in toxicity testing of chemicals is that toxicity effects are doe-dependent: the true toxic hits may show no toxicity at all at low dose level. Therefore, traditiona high-throughput screening (HTS) that test chemicals only at a single concentration is not suitable for toxicity screening. On the contrary, the recently developed quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) platforms can evaluate each chemical across a broad range of concentrations, and is gaining ever-increasing popularity as a tool for in vitro toxicity profiling The concentration-response information generated by qHTS are expected to provide more accurate and comprehensive information of the toxicity effects of chemicals, offering promising data that can be mined to estimate in vivo toxicities of chemicals. However, our previous studies showed that if processed inappropriately, such concentration-response information contribute little to improve the toxicity prediction. This is especially true when multiple types of qHTS data are used together. Therefore, in this study, we will extend our previous approaches to develop novel statistical and computational tools that can curate, preprocess, and normalize the concentration-response information from multiple different qHTS databases.  Traditionally, toxicity models are based on either the chemical data (such as the quantitative structure- activity relationship analysis), or the in vitro toxicity profiling data (such as the in vitro-in vivo extrapolations). Our previous experiences suggested that integrating biological descriptors such as the in vitro cytotoxicity profiles or the short-term toxigenomic data, with chemical structural features is able to predict rodent acute liver toxicity with reasonable accuracy. Therefore, the second part of this proposal will be devoted to develop novel computational models for hepatotoxicity prediction by integrating qHTS toxicity profiles and chemical structural information In Aim 1, we will curate, preprocess, and normalize collected public liver toxicity datasets. In ths study, we will model toxicity effects using multiple large public datasets such as HTS and qHTS bioassay data (Tox21[1] and ToxCast[2]), hepatotoxicity side effect reports on marketed failed drugs[3], the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base Benchmark Dataset (LTKB-BD[4]), etc. Statistical methods for cross-study validation and quality control will be applied to the collected datasets to ensure computational compatibility and to select the appropriate datasets for analysis. In Aim 2, we will develop predictive models for chemicals' liver toxicity based on an integrative modeling workflow that will make use of both structural and in vitro toxicity profiles of a chemical. Our previous studies [5] showed that models using both in vitro toxicity profiles and chemical structural data have better accuracy for rodent acute liver toxicity than models using either data type alone. Here, we will develop a novel modeling workflow that start with defining the functional clusters of chemicals via curated qHTS toxicity profiles, and is followed by developing computational models to correlate chemical and biological data with overall toxicity risks in humans. The predictive models will be validated using independent datasets with over 800 compounds. In Aim 3, we propose to prioritize the qHTS profiling assays used in the model for future toxicity testing. We will evaluate all the in vitro assays as biological descriptors from thee perspectives, including descriptor importance in the integrative toxicity model, correlation with i vivo DILI outcomes, and level of information content estimated by a novel approach based on network analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study we aim to develop computational models that can identify potential liver toxicants. Liver toxicity is a significant contributor to the high attition rate in drug development. Moreover, toxic chemicals in food, water, and consumer products all pose serious risks for liver toxicity. As a result, there is great interest in developing high-throughput, high-content experimental and computational tools to evaluate the liver toxicity of thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. This study focuses on developing novel informatics tools that enable the extraction and integration of chemical concentration-response information from multiple quantitative high-throughput screening databases for model development, and developing statistical models that are able to integrate this concentration-response information with chemical structural features to predict their risk of liver toxicity.

"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9235506,R01GM108340,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data structure', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,309750,-0.035214657235587477
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is entitled ""Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning."" One of the most challenging and longest studied problems in computer-aided drug design has been affinity prediction of small molecule ligands for their cognate protein targets. Despite decades of work, quantitative structure-activity re- lationship prediction (QSAR) approaches still suffer from poor accuracy, especially when predicting outside of closely related series of molecules. Even with high-quality structures of target proteins, approaches grounded in physics are also far from robust and accurate enough for reliable use in drug lead optimization. This proposal will build upon a foundation in multiple-instance machine learning applied to computer-aided drug design problems and develop a robust, accurate, and practically applicable affinity prediction methodology. The methodology requires only ligand structures and associated activity data for training, and it induces a virtual protein binding site composed of molecular fragments. The virtual binding pocket (or ""pocketmol"") is used in conjunction with a scoring function developed originally for molecular docking. The pocketmol configuration is chosen such that the optimal conformation and alignment of a ligand (based on the docking scoring function), yields scores for training ligands that are close to the known experimental values. Feasibility has been demon- strated in papers involving both membrane-bound receptors and enzymes.  However, multiple challenges remain and are the subject of the proposed research. There are three key issues. First, there exist many pocketmols that satisfy the requirements of fitting the training data, so general solutions must be developed to address the inductive bias of the learning procedure as well as model selection after the procedure. Second, since any particular model is the product of a learning process, it will have some domain of applicability, with some new molecules likely to be predicted well and others poorly. Further, the model will be better informed by learning with certain new molecules but not others. We must develop solutions for estimating confidence of predictions for new molecules as well as for identifying particular molecules that will be highly informative. Third, the operational application of these methods involves model building, guided chemical synthesis, and iterative refinement of models. Convincing validation will require application on temporal series of molecules synthesized for multiple targets of pharmaceutical interest. The proposed work will develop novel methods to address these challenges and will establish extensive validation on multiple pharmaceutically relevant temporal series of small molecules that were the subject of real-world lead-optimization exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The dominant mode of therapeutic discovery involves the design ""me-too"" drugs that are very similar in structure and effect to existing drugs. In order to address the unmet medical needs of an aging population, novel therapeutics must be developed, and this will require much more creativity in the design process. The proposed research will develop a predictive computational framework to aid in active design of structurally novel drug molecules during the drug discovery lead optimization process.",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,8987578,R01GM101689,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Creativeness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Enzymes', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Series', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'blind', 'chemical synthesis', 'computer framework', 'design', 'design and construction', 'drug discovery', 'falls', 'interest', 'model building', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'prospective', 'receptor binding', 'small molecule', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,301150,-0.018276055767525518
"A Machine-Learning Based Software Widget for Resolving Metabolite Identities Owing to recent technological advances in measurement platforms, it is now possible to simultaneously detect and characterize a very large number of metabolites covering a substantial fraction of the small molecules present in a biological sample. This presents an exciting opportunity to develop potentially transformative approaches to study cells and organisms. One major challenge in realizing this potential lies in processing and analyzing the data. A typical dataset from an untargeted experiment contains many of thousands of “features,” each of which could correspond to a unique metabolite. Analyzing such datasets to obtain meaningful biological information depends on reliably and efficiently resolving the chemical identities of the detected features. Currently, in silico fragmentation methods predict candidate metabolites that are scored and ranked based on how well the fragmentation explains the observed MS/MS spectrum, and on other factors influencing fragmentation such as bond dissociation energies and ionization conditions. Deciding which candidate metabolites is the best match for a particular feature in the context of the biological sample, however, is a daunting task. Extensive testing of candidate metabolites against chemical standards library may be prohibitive in terms of cost and efforts. We seek to develop software-enabled workflows centered on resolving metabolite identities. Our approach is to exploit knowledge of the biological context of a sample to identify the metabolites. Recognizing that the metabolites present in a sample result from enzyme-catalyzed biochemical reactions active in the corresponding biological system, we employ topological analysis and inference to best map the metabolites implied by the detected features to metabolic pathways that are feasible based on the genome(s) of cells in the biological system. Aim 1 develops a computational method based on Bayesian-inference to enhance candidate metabolite rankings that are obtained via in silico fragmentation analysis. Our method utilizes all available information (database lookups, in silico fragmentation analysis, and network/pathway context) to maximally inform and adjust the rankings. Aim 2 will build software widgets to implement the metabolite identification workflow within a data-analytics framework. As the analytics framework, we will use Orange, which allows the user to create interactive data analysis pipelines through a plug-and-play graphical user interface (GUI). Aim 3 will validate the computational method and software widget implementation. Experimental validation will utilize high-purity standards to confirm (or reject) the computationally assigned metabolite identities. Widget implementation will be evaluated through a focus group discussion with the widget users in the labs directed by the PIs. As project outcomes, we anticipate both a methodological advance in analyzing mass signature data as well as a suite of easily accessible software in the form of widgets. Metabolomics is concerned with the comprehensive characterization of the small molecule metabolites in biological systems. Owing to recent technological advances in measurement platforms, it is now possible to simultaneously detect and characterize a very large number of metabolites. Prospectively, advanced computational tools and software for metabolomics data analysis can aid discovery efforts aimed at identifying novel bioactive metabolites that could be developed into diagnostic indicators or therapeutic agents. ",A Machine-Learning Based Software Widget for Resolving Metabolite Identities,9223450,R03CA211839,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Oranges', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical standard', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'database query', 'flexibility', 'functional outcomes', 'graphical user interface', 'heuristics', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'instrument', 'ionization', 'mass spectrometer', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'software development']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R03,2016,147569,-0.037269425454131276
"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms. In total, our findings will yield tremendous insights into non-coding RNA biology and will substantially impact continued study of these important molecules. We propose to develop computational methods to study novel non-coding RNA transcripts by leveraging a new duplex RNA sequencing technique. Our first objective is to develop a maximum likelihood algorithm that estimates secondary structure using double-stranded or single-stranded RNA sequencing. We will also develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features from RNA-seq experiments.

"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"Discovery of LXR Agonists via Pharmacophore Space Mining The goal of this proposal is to discover drug-like liver X receptor (LXR) β selective agonists that can halt and reverse the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent work demonstrated that activation of the LXR signaling pathways leads to improved amyloid β (Aβ) turnover, reduction in Aβ plaque area, and the reversal of cognitive, social and olfactory deficits. The research plan consists of two steps. The first step is computer-aided prediction of agonistic LXRβ selective binding, blood brain barrier permeability, and absence of side effects such as mutagenicity or binding to undesired targets. This step relies on a novel method for pharmacophore analysis by examining the joint space of chemical compounds, targets, and chemical/biological properties. This joint space is defined using machine learning on the 3D geometry of spatial arrangement of pharmacophoric points, using attributes such as donors, acceptors, aromatic rings, and charged fragments. The second step consists of biological assays to assess toxicity, brain penetration potential and the ability to induce expression of the corresponding genes. A dozen diverse compounds will have been tested through two iterations of the two steps of in silico prediction and assays at the end of Phase 1. These initial leads will be augmented with additional de novo compounds and further scrutinized via behavioral assays, dose-response studies and more detailed, sophisticated, and mechanistic assays during Phase 2. The outcome of this study will be new drug leads to potentially treat and prevent AD at different stages of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Interleaving of computer-aided screening of large chemical databases through novel machine learning based models with biological assays will identify drug-like LXRβ selective agonists with minimal side-effects.

"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design A fundamental challenge to translate insights between biomedical researchers, who study biological mechanisms, and clinicians, who diagnose patient symptoms, is that many links between biological processes and disease pathophysiology are poorly understood. A comprehensive Biomedical Translator must enable chains of inference across objects as diverse as genetic mutations, molecular effects, tissue-specific expression patterns, cellular processes, organ phenotypes, disease states, patient symptoms, and drug responses, a challenge beyond the scope of any one organization. Fortunately, many individual links in this chain have been made by experiments yielding statistical connections between individual data types. High-throughput perturbation screens link chemical and genetic perturbations to cellular phenotypes such as gene-expression patterns, cell survival, or changes in phosphorylation. Genetic association studies link mutations to human disease or intermediate phenotypes and biomarkers. Electronic medical records (EMR) link diseases or human phenotypes to diagnostic or current procedural terminology (CPT) codes, and clinical trials link the impact of drugs and drug candidates on disease states. In principle, incorporating these links into chains of inference could translate results between the full set of data types within them. In practice, each link is maintained by experts with domain-specific experiments, semantic terminology, and methodological standards. While a key challenge faced by a global Biomedical Translator is to establish consistent standards across these existing data types, a more important goal is to develop a principled and robust framework to (a) model biological systems and experimental approaches to investigate them; (b) organize knowledge about biological mechanism and disease; and (c) incorporate diverse datasets that serve as windows into the underlying and unknown state of nature. We propose to implement a Biomedical Translator as a probabilistic graphical model, a paradigm from artificial intelligence (AI) research. Just as separate research communities form weakly coupled parts of the translation process, graphical models allow global inferences from weakly coupled “nodes”. These inferences require each node to publish only probability distributions, enabling interoperability without necessarily having global entity-resolution standards, and benefit from paradigms for quality control, fault tolerance, and relevance assessment common in AI research. We hypothesize that a limited number of APIs, implemented as probability computations by communities around the world, would yield a Biomedical Translator as an emergent property of weakly coupled knowledge sources. From basic properties of graphical models, such a Translator could probabilistically translate among any data types connected within it, allowing for relatively complex query concepts. For example: What cellular processes in which tissues are impacted in a patient-based EMR? What genetic mutations sensitize cells to small-molecule treatment effects? Which small molecules mimic genetic “experiments of nature” that protect against disease? To illustrate the value of these resources and our architectural paradigm, we propose a demonstration project to implement a Biomedical Translator supporting queries between small molecules, biological processes, genes, and disease. The demonstration project will provide a valuable first step to confront key data-integration and organizational challenges and will enable previously impossible queries, such as identifying small molecules that perturb the same biological processes implicated by human genetics in a disease context. In this capacity, such Translator could realistically identify existing drugs for known symptoms (i.e., repurposing), but could more broadly serve as an engine for hypothesis generation and biological discovery, suggesting pre-clinical small molecules to develop based on their observed biological activity, or providing heretofore novel links between cellular protein function and disease pathophysiology. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9337924,OT3TR002025,"['Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Current Procedural Terminology Codes', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Probability', 'Processed Genes', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'Terminology', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translation Process', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical genetics', 'data integration', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'drug candidate', 'genetic association', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'protein function', 'research study', 'response', 'small molecule', 'treatment effect']",NCATS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",OT3,2016,399608,-5.4120396592414376e-05
"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.        ","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9070289,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'human disease', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2016,377807,0.040964687187462656
"Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers for Heterogeneous Glioblastomas PROJECT SUMMARY  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant form of brain tumors with more than 18,000 newly diagnosed patients and 13,000 deaths annually in the United States. The prognosis for GBM remains dismal with a median survival time of GBM patients of 14 to 16 months after diagnosis. A hallmark of malignant GBM is their high heterogeneity within the tumors. This unique characteristic manifests to molecular subtypes of GBM that display unique patterns of pathogenesis, biology, and prognosis. While specific molecular markers are of value in clinical care (e.g., IDH1/2 mutations, 1p/19q co-deletion), significant improvement in prognostic stratification and targeted therapeutics are urgently needed. With the ultimate goal of realizing the full potential of personalized and precision medicine, we propose to interrogate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in a cohort of clinical GBM specimens. LncRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that have emerged as critical modulators in various cellular processes through gene regulation. Previous studies including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), though limited by their profiling technique not designed for non-coding RNAs, have suggested that lncRNAs are abundant in human cancers and are highly cancer-type-specific. In particular, lncRNAs have been implicated in brain function and glioma development. Specifically, in this exploratory project, we will apply the Ribo-Zero-based transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) to comprehensively characterize lncRNAs in 100 clinical GBM samples that have been collected at the Northwestern University Brain Tumor Tissue Bank (Aim 1a). In contrast to the oligo(dT)-based RNA-seq that was used by previous studies, including TCGA, the Ribo-Zero-based technique is optimized for non-coding RNA transcripts, thus offering a great advantage for profiling all potentially functional lncRNAs in GBM. Notably, a novel detection algorithm based on machine learning will be developed to provide a more flexible and universal framework of lncRNA detection using RNA-seq. Though restricted to those lncRNAs shared between our GBM data and the oligo(dT)-based TCGA, we will evaluate the tissue-specificity of lncRNAs detected in GBM using TCGA data on several solid tumors (Aim 1b). After characterizing the landscape of lncRNAs in GBM, we will evaluate whether lncRNAs are associated with the clinical outcomes of GBM patients, and evaluate the feasibility of integrating lncRNAs and gene-level transcripts into a prognostic tool (Aim 2a). This proposal will enable us to employ these novel biomarkers for the prognosis of GBM as well as future functional studies. In addition, we will utilize co-expression network analysis to assign functions to the detected lncRNAs in GBM. An integrated, internet-based catalog will be constructed to provide a resource of lncRNAs in GBM that will benefit the general research community in this new area (Aim 2b). Finally, the PIs have assembled an outstanding research team with significant achievements in relevant research areas and complimentary expertise, therefore ensuring the success of this multidisciplinary and highly innovative project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This work seeks to understand whether long non-coding RNAs implicate in the prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a form of malignant brain tumors. By characterizing these novel gene regulatory molecules in GBM, we expect to identify novel biomarkers that can be used as a prognostic tool for patients with GBM.

"An Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central dogma of molecular biology has undergone a significant revision where RNAs have emerged as important regulators of cell activity. Astonishingly, as much as 80% of human DNA is transcribed into RNA as recently reported by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium. New classes of RNA are being identified including many which are non-protein coding (ncRNA). Nonetheless ncRNAs are involved in regulating cellular activity. Deciphering the structure-function relationship of these RNAs is of immediate importance as ncRNAs have now been implicated in a variety of diseases including myotonic dystrophy type 1, prostate cancer, spinal muscular atrophy, and Huntington's disease-like 2. Traditional approaches to determine high-resolution RNA 3D structures have proven to be prohibitively time consuming and expensive. Nymirum has developed an Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System that is faster, cheaper, and more robust than current approaches.

"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in drug discovery rely on the development of novel effective computational methodologies.

"Development of integrative models for early liver toxicity assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational toxicology has become a critical area of research due to the burgeoning need to evaluate thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals with unknown toxicity profiles, the high demand in time and resources by current experimental toxicity testing, and the growing ethical concerns over animal use in toxicity studies. Despite tremendous efforts, little success has been attained thus far in the development of predictive computational models for toxicity, primarily due to the complexity of toxicity mechanisms as well as the lack of high-quality experimental data for model development.  A critical challenge in toxicity testing of chemicals is that toxicity effects are doe-dependent: the true toxic hits may show no toxicity at all at low dose level. Therefore, traditiona high-throughput screening (HTS) that test chemicals only at a single concentration is not suitable for toxicity screening. On the contrary, the recently developed quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) platforms can evaluate each chemical across a broad range of concentrations, and is gaining ever-increasing popularity as a tool for in vitro toxicity profiling The concentration-response information generated by qHTS are expected to provide more accurate and comprehensive information of the toxicity effects of chemicals, offering promising data that can be mined to estimate in vivo toxicities of chemicals. However, our previous studies showed that if processed inappropriately, such concentration-response information contribute little to improve the toxicity prediction. This is especially true when multiple types of qHTS data are used together. Therefore, in this study, we will extend our previous approaches to develop novel statistical and computational tools that can curate, preprocess, and normalize the concentration-response information from multiple different qHTS databases.  Traditionally, toxicity models are based on either the chemical data (such as the quantitative structure- activity relationship analysis), or the in vitro toxicity profiling data (such as the in vitro-in vivo extrapolations). Our previous experiences suggested that integrating biological descriptors such as the in vitro cytotoxicity profiles or the short-term toxigenomic data, with chemical structural features is able to predict rodent acute liver toxicity with reasonable accuracy. Therefore, the second part of this proposal will be devoted to develop novel computational models for hepatotoxicity prediction by integrating qHTS toxicity profiles and chemical structural information In Aim 1, we will curate, preprocess, and normalize collected public liver toxicity datasets. In ths study, we will model toxicity effects using multiple large public datasets such as HTS and qHTS bioassay data (Tox21[1] and ToxCast[2]), hepatotoxicity side effect reports on marketed failed drugs[3], the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base Benchmark Dataset (LTKB-BD[4]), etc. Statistical methods for cross-study validation and quality control will be applied to the collected datasets to ensure computational compatibility and to select the appropriate datasets for analysis. In Aim 2, we will develop predictive models for chemicals' liver toxicity based on an integrative modeling workflow that will make use of both structural and in vitro toxicity profiles of a chemical. Our previous studies [5] showed that models using both in vitro toxicity profiles and chemical structural data have better accuracy for rodent acute liver toxicity than models using either data type alone. Here, we will develop a novel modeling workflow that start with defining the functional clusters of chemicals via curated qHTS toxicity profiles, and is followed by developing computational models to correlate chemical and biological data with overall toxicity risks in humans. The predictive models will be validated using independent datasets with over 800 compounds. In Aim 3, we propose to prioritize the qHTS profiling assays used in the model for future toxicity testing. We will evaluate all the in vitro assays as biological descriptors from thee perspectives, including descriptor importance in the integrative toxicity model, correlation with i vivo DILI outcomes, and level of information content estimated by a novel approach based on network analysis.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study we aim to develop computational models that can identify potential liver toxicants. Liver toxicity is a significant contributor to the high attition rate in drug development. Moreover, toxic chemicals in food, water, and consumer products all pose serious risks for liver toxicity. As a result, there is great interest in developing high-throughput, high-content experimental and computational tools to evaluate the liver toxicity of thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. This study focuses on developing novel informatics tools that enable the extraction and integration of chemical concentration-response information from multiple quantitative high-throughput screening databases for model development, and developing statistical models that are able to integrate this concentration-response information with chemical structural features to predict their risk of liver toxicity.

"Computer-aided Design and In vitro Testing of Novel Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite major advances in the subject of marijuana and cannabinoid (CB) research, there are only a few CB ligands currently available as FDA-approved drugs, partly because of the absence of experimental structures of CB receptors and a lack of knowledge of the conformational dynamics of the receptors, as well as a limited knowledge of the ligand-binding (orthosteric or allosteric) sites within the CB receptors. Very few allosteric modulators have been identified for CB receptors. There is great potential for discovery of novel CB ligands targeting either orthosteric or allosteric CB1 or CB2 receptor sites. Activators or inhibitors of these receptors are being investigated as therapeutic agents for many important human ailments including neuropathic pain, neuroinflammation, ischemic/reperfusion injury, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. In this project, computational modeling of human CB1 and CB2 ligands, receptors, and receptor-ligand interactions will be carried out. We are interested in discovering orthosteric agonists selective for CB2 over CB1, peripherally- restricted antagonists, as well as allosteric CB modulators, all of which may be able to provide efficacy without causing negative psychotropic effects. Systematic, computationally-intensive research will yield novel active hit CB receptor modulators, which can later be developed into lead drug candidates. This will be accomplished through the following specific aims: Aim 1. To model, train and validate various ligand-based mathematical models to predict and classify CB ligands as agonists or antagonists. Literature- reported CB ligands and activity data as well as experimental data obtained for proprietary molecules being tested at the University of Mississippi, School of Pharmacy will be curated. Ligand-based models will be constructed, trained and validated. Aim 2. To construct, validate and simulate computational models of the CB1 and CB2 receptors in their active and inactive states. Receptor models will be developed, some that are tailored for agonists (active state) and some for antagonists or inverse agonists (basal or inactive states), utilizing structural information from multiple homologous GPCR templates. Aim 3. To apply integrated ligand-based and receptor-based virtual screening (VS) protocols to discover orthosteric and allosteric CB modulators. Validated models from Aims 1 and 2 will be used strategically in VS protocols to discover novel orthosteric and allosteric CB ligand chemotypes. We will screen repositories of small molecules including MarinLit, ZINC, and that of the National Center for Natural Products Research (NCNPR) and virtual libraries generated using computational tools to access extended chemical space. Top- ranked VS hits will be procured, purified if necessary, and characterized to confirm their structures. Aim 4. To conduct in vitro testing in CB1 and CB2 receptor binding and functional assays. Potential hit compounds from Aim 3 will be tested in CB1 and CB2 receptor binding and functional assays in the University of Mississippi School of Pharmacy NIH COBRE-supported In Vitro Research Core.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through computational modeling of the requirements for modulating the cannabinoid (CB) receptor subtypes, CB1 and CB2, which are class-A G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), we intend to discover molecules which act through the CB receptors and that could later be developed into new drugs to treat many important human ailments including neuropathic pain, neuroinflammation, ischemic/reperfusion injury, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy.            ",Computer-aided Design and In vitro Testing of Novel Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators,9099196,R15GM119061,"['Academia', 'Adverse effects', 'Affinity', 'Agonist', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CNR1 gene', 'CNR2 gene', 'Cannabidiol', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cannabis', 'Cannabis sativa plant', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Data', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Government', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Methods', 'Mississippi', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mutagenesis', 'Natural Products', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Organism', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy Schools', 'Plants', 'Publishing', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Virtual Library', 'base', 'cannabinoid receptor', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mathematical model', 'nanomolar', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'painful neuropathy', 'pharmacophore', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'repository', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI,R15,2016,427379,-0.04182136615725118
"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain. Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders. This proposal seeks to establish the interactions among selected RBPs and their functional RNA elements in mammalian neurons. This will be a crucial first step in elucidating the RNA networks regulated by these RBPs in the brain.",Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain,8997123,R01NS075449,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Angelman Syndrome', 'Antibodies', 'Antisense Oligonucleotides', 'Behavioral', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Double-Stranded RNA', 'ES Cell Line', 'Elements', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'Expression Library', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Future', 'Genomic approach', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indium', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger, Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'crosslink', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'lentiviral-mediated', 'messenger ribonucleoprotein', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein complex', 'relating to nervous system', 'ribosome profiling', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,599873,0.007147784965104426
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is entitled ""Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning."" One of the most challenging and longest studied problems in computer-aided drug design has been affinity prediction of small molecule ligands for their cognate protein targets. Despite decades of work, quantitative structure-activity re- lationship prediction (QSAR) approaches still suffer from poor accuracy, especially when predicting outside of closely related series of molecules. Even with high-quality structures of target proteins, approaches grounded in physics are also far from robust and accurate enough for reliable use in drug lead optimization. This proposal will build upon a foundation in multiple-instance machine learning applied to computer-aided drug design problems and develop a robust, accurate, and practically applicable affinity prediction methodology. The methodology requires only ligand structures and associated activity data for training, and it induces a virtual protein binding site composed of molecular fragments. The virtual binding pocket (or ""pocketmol"") is used in conjunction with a scoring function developed originally for molecular docking. The pocketmol configuration is chosen such that the optimal conformation and alignment of a ligand (based on the docking scoring function), yields scores for training ligands that are close to the known experimental values. Feasibility has been demon- strated in papers involving both membrane-bound receptors and enzymes.  However, multiple challenges remain and are the subject of the proposed research. There are three key issues. First, there exist many pocketmols that satisfy the requirements of fitting the training data, so general solutions must be developed to address the inductive bias of the learning procedure as well as model selection after the procedure. Second, since any particular model is the product of a learning process, it will have some domain of applicability, with some new molecules likely to be predicted well and others poorly. Further, the model will be better informed by learning with certain new molecules but not others. We must develop solutions for estimating confidence of predictions for new molecules as well as for identifying particular molecules that will be highly informative. Third, the operational application of these methods involves model building, guided chemical synthesis, and iterative refinement of models. Convincing validation will require application on temporal series of molecules synthesized for multiple targets of pharmaceutical interest. The proposed work will develop novel methods to address these challenges and will establish extensive validation on multiple pharmaceutically relevant temporal series of small molecules that were the subject of real-world lead-optimization exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The dominant mode of therapeutic discovery involves the design ""me-too"" drugs that are very similar in structure and effect to existing drugs. In order to address the unmet medical needs of an aging population, novel therapeutics must be developed, and this will require much more creativity in the design process. The proposed research will develop a predictive computational framework to aid in active design of structurally novel drug molecules during the drug discovery lead optimization process.",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,8786087,R01GM101689,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Creativeness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Enzymes', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Series', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'blind', 'chemical synthesis', 'computer framework', 'design', 'design and construction', 'drug discovery', 'falls', 'interest', 'model building', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'prospective', 'receptor binding', 'small molecule', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2015,300675,-0.018276055767525518

"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems. The results of our fundamental research will be new computer codes for modeling macromolecular assemblies, the structures of which facilitate the prediction of medically relevant functions.            ",Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy,8964685,R01GM062968,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin Fiber', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Filaments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Filament', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hair Cells', 'Health', 'Heating', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Motors', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Plant Resins', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Stereocilium', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tomogram', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'base', 'computer code', 'cryogenics', 'density', 'design', 'fitness', 'fundamental research', 'high standard', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'macromolecular assembly', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tomography', 'tool']",NIGMS,OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,307928,-0.016965764403025753
"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks Project summary It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.

"An Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central dogma of molecular biology has undergone a significant revision where RNAs have emerged as important regulators of cell activity. Astonishingly, as much as 80% of human DNA is transcribed into RNA as recently reported by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium. New classes of RNA are being identified including many which are non-protein coding (ncRNA). Nonetheless ncRNAs are involved in regulating cellular activity. Deciphering the structure-function relationship of these RNAs is of immediate importance as ncRNAs have now been implicated in a variety of diseases including myotonic dystrophy type 1, prostate cancer, spinal muscular atrophy, and Huntington's disease-like 2. Traditional approaches to determine high-resolution RNA 3D structures have proven to be prohibitively time consuming and expensive. Nymirum has developed an Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System that is faster, cheaper, and more robust than current approaches. This System will be commercialized for use by the drug industry and academic researchers in their quest to understand and treat human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RNA 3D structure and function information is critical to understanding basic cell function, delineating dysfunctional RNA contribution to human disease, and finding new drugs to treat diseases caused by dysfunctional RNAs.

"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain. Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders. This proposal seeks to establish the interactions among selected RBPs and their functional RNA elements in mammalian neurons. This will be a crucial first step in elucidating the RNA networks regulated by these RBPs in the brain.",Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain,8790775,R01NS075449,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Angelman Syndrome', 'Antibodies', 'Antisense Oligonucleotides', 'Behavioral', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Double-Stranded RNA', 'ES Cell Line', 'Elements', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'Expression Library', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Future', 'Genomic approach', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indium', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger, Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'crosslink', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'human RBM5 protein', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'lentiviral-mediated', 'messenger ribonucleoprotein', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein complex', 'relating to nervous system', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,599873,0.007147784965104426
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is entitled ""Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning."" One of the most challenging and longest studied problems in computer-aided drug design has been affinity prediction of small molecule ligands for their cognate protein targets. Despite decades of work, quantitative structure-activity re- lationship prediction (QSAR) approaches still suffer from poor accuracy, especially when predicting outside of closely related series of molecules. Even with high-quality structures of target proteins, approaches grounded in physics are also far from robust and accurate enough for reliable use in drug lead optimization. This proposal will build upon a foundation in multiple-instance machine learning applied to computer-aided drug design problems and develop a robust, accurate, and practically applicable affinity prediction methodology. The methodology requires only ligand structures and associated activity data for training, and it induces a virtual protein binding site composed of molecular fragments. The virtual binding pocket (or ""pocketmol"") is used in conjunction with a scoring function developed originally for molecular docking. The pocketmol configuration is chosen such that the optimal conformation and alignment of a ligand (based on the docking scoring function), yields scores for training ligands that are close to the known experimental values. Feasibility has been demon- strated in papers involving both membrane-bound receptors and enzymes.  However, multiple challenges remain and are the subject of the proposed research. There are three key issues. First, there exist many pocketmols that satisfy the requirements of fitting the training data, so general solutions must be developed to address the inductive bias of the learning procedure as well as model selection after the procedure. Second, since any particular model is the product of a learning process, it will have some domain of applicability, with some new molecules likely to be predicted well and others poorly. Further, the model will be better informed by learning with certain new molecules but not others. We must develop solutions for estimating confidence of predictions for new molecules as well as for identifying particular molecules that will be highly informative. Third, the operational application of these methods involves model building, guided chemical synthesis, and iterative refinement of models. Convincing validation will require application on temporal series of molecules synthesized for multiple targets of pharmaceutical interest. The proposed work will develop novel methods to address these challenges and will establish extensive validation on multiple pharmaceutically relevant temporal series of small molecules that were the subject of real-world lead-optimization exercises.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The dominant mode of therapeutic discovery involves the design ""me-too"" drugs that are very similar in structure and effect to existing drugs. In order to address the unmet medical needs of an aging population, novel therapeutics must be developed, and this will require much more creativity in the design process. The proposed research will develop a predictive computational framework to aid in active design of structurally novel drug molecules during the drug discovery lead optimization process.            ",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,8598096,R01GM101689,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Creativeness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Enzymes', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Series', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'blind', 'chemical synthesis', 'computer framework', 'design', 'design and construction', 'drug discovery', 'falls', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'small molecule', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2014,299250,-0.018276055767525518
"Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nanomaterial science, toxicology, cell biology, high throughput screening, biostatistics, mathematics and computer science with the overall goal of gaining fundamental understanding of how the physical and Chemical properties of carefully selected ENM libraries relate to interactions with cells and cellular structures, including how these bio-physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface may lead to pulmonary toxicity. This goal will be executed through the acquisition, synthesis and characterization of compositional and combinatorial ENM libraries that focus on the major physicochemical properties of nominated metal, metal oxide and silica nanoparticles {Scientific Core), hypothesized to play a role in pulmonary toxicity through the generation of oxidative stress, inflammation, signal pathway activation and membrane lysis. These efforts will be assisted by in silico modeling that use heatmaps, mathematical models and machine learning to perform hazard ranking and risk prediction. The major objectives of the Center are: (i) To establish an overarching predictive toxicological paradigm, which is defined as the assessment of in vivo toxic potential of ENM based on in vitro and in silico methods (integrated center effort); (ii) To establish rapid throughput cellular screening and conduct imaging to identify compositional and combinatorial ENM properties that lead to bioavailability and engagement of the injury pathways discussed above (Project 1); (iii) To establish through the performance of instillation and inhalation exposures in the rodent lung how the structure-property relationships linking ENM to in vitro injury mechanisms may be predictive of pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion (Project 2); (iv) To develop in silico toxicity models that utilize multivariate analysis of the rapid throughput screening and cellular imaging data to show the relationships that can be used to develop ""nano-QSARs"" for probabilistic risk ranking (Project 3).        We propose a center to study how properties of engineered nanomaterials may lead to lung health effects by creating harmful interactions in cells and tissues that will come into contact with these materials.

"An Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central dogma of molecular biology has undergone a significant revision where RNAs have emerged as important regulators of cell activity. Astonishingly, as much as 80% of human DNA is transcribed into RNA as recently reported by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium. New classes of RNA are being identified including many which are non-protein coding (ncRNA). Nonetheless ncRNAs are involved in regulating cellular activity. Deciphering the structure-function relationship of these RNAs is of immediate importance as ncRNAs have now been implicated in a variety of diseases including myotonic dystrophy type 1, prostate cancer, spinal muscular atrophy, and Huntington's disease-like 2. Traditional approaches to determine high-resolution RNA 3D structures have proven to be prohibitively time consuming and expensive. Nymirum has developed an Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System that is faster, cheaper, and more robust than current approaches. This System will be commercialized for use by the drug industry and academic researchers in their quest to understand and treat human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RNA 3D structure and function information is critical to understanding basic cell function, delineating dysfunctional RNA contribution to human disease, and finding new drugs to treat diseases caused by dysfunctional RNAs.

"Unlocking transcript diversity via differential analyses of splice graphs Abstract A most basic difference between cells of the same genotype and different phenotype lies in their transcriptome. Understanding the difference between two transcriptomes in terms of the RNA molecules present in each, or changes in abundance of specific molecules, can offer valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of disease, development, and specialization. High throughput sequencing provides a unique view of the transcriptome in the form of millions or even billions of short reads of nucleotide sequences sampled from the RNA molecules. To date, nearly 1000 such RNA-seq datasets have already been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. Beyond measuring differences in overall expression of genes between samples, there is a critical need to measure differences in expression at the transcript level. Computational tools that can extract significant changes in transcript diversity across populations with RNA-seq are in immediate demand. However, reconstructing the full extent of transcript isoforms from this wealth of data is not a solved problem because of fundamental ambiguities between isoforms at the scale of the short read samples.  We propose a novel approach to the differential analysis of transcriptomes that does not depend on the reconstruction of the full-length transcripts, and yet can accurately pinpoint the variation of transcriptomes. Our techniques are data-driven and applicable to any transcriptome, requiring only a reference genome, and do not depend on a priori gene structure annotations. Our research program builds on our highly sensitive and accurate MapSplice alignment algorithm to construct expression weighted splice graphs (ESG) from RNA-seq datasets. ESGs can be three orders of magnitude smaller in size than current RNA-seq datasets, yet fully represent the substantive biological content of such datasets. The ESG representation supports highly efficient analysis techniques that can directly identify and visualize statistically significant differential transcription between samples. Generalizations of the algorithms are proposed to identify co-regulated splicing patterns that are keys for biological pathway analyses and systems biology analyses.  We have established an ongoing interactive and collaborative research environment among the co-PIs and Co-Is which include the biologists, computer scientists and statistician. The proposed computational methods will be tested and refined using RNA-seq data generated from breast cancer cell lines before being further applied to three well curated RNA-seq datasets on lung cancer pathogenesis, stem cells in leukemia, and equine articular cartilage development and repair (a non-model mammalian organism). Experimental validation of differentially expressed transcript isoforms will both improve the accuracy of our methods, as well as propose novel candidates for alternative isoforms associated with lung cancer,and leukemia diseases, and chondrocyte differentiation.  The software will be open-source and will be developed as a set of components that can be used on their own or integrated into RNA-seq processing workflows. In particular we will integrate the components into the Galaxy cloud computing framework hosted on a local server. As such the methods will be available to researchers worldwide. As components mature they may be installed in other servers worldwide to provide a convenient and secure way to analyze transcriptomes.  Unveiling the dynamics of the transcriptome at modest cost will revolutionize cellular diagnostics and biomedical research. Genome-wide measurement of transcription variants offers the potential for detailed molecular information about cellular identity and function that will greatly expand traditional histological assessment. Cloud-based access to the methods can turn individual laboratories into small genome centers and will enable individual scientists to assess differences among RNA transcriptomes in a matter of days. Our suite of algorithms will enable biomedical researchers to prioritize candidate genes or different gene ontology categories to investigate further for differential transcription and mechanistic importance between experimental conditions. Project Narrative  This project will develop new techniques to compare the transcriptome of different cells, sampled using high-throughput sequencing technology. As the transcriptome consists of the RNA ""instructions"" controlling the cell's functions, differential analysis can provide detailed insight into the difference between healthy and diseased cells, or can be used to more clearly discover the functional differences between, say, liver cells and brain cells.",Unlocking transcript diversity via differential analyses of splice graphs,8660317,R01HG006272,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cancer cell line', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Categories', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chondrocytes', 'Cloud Computing', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equus caballus', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Galaxy', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Fusion', 'Gene Structure', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Hepatocyte', 'High Performance Computing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'anticancer research', 'articular cartilage', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cartilage development', 'cartilage repair', 'cloud based', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome annotation', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'meetings', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'statistics', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2014,403681,0.017869848443792802
"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain.          Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders. This proposal seeks to establish the interactions among selected RBPs and their functional RNA elements in mammalian neurons. This will be a crucial first step in elucidating the RNA networks regulated by these RBPs in the brain.

"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is entitled ""Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning."" One of the most challenging and longest studied problems in computer-aided drug design has been affinity prediction of small molecule ligands for their cognate protein targets. Despite decades of work, quantitative structure-activity re- lationship prediction (QSAR) approaches still suffer from poor accuracy, especially when predicting outside of closely related series of molecules. Even with high-quality structures of target proteins, approaches grounded in physics are also far from robust and accurate enough for reliable use in drug lead optimization. This proposal will build upon a foundation in multiple-instance machine learning applied to computer-aided drug design problems and develop a robust, accurate, and practically applicable affinity prediction methodology. The methodology requires only ligand structures and associated activity data for training, and it induces a virtual protein binding site composed of molecular fragments. The virtual binding pocket (or ""pocketmol"") is used in conjunction with a scoring function developed originally for molecular docking. The pocketmol configuration is chosen such that the optimal conformation and alignment of a ligand (based on the docking scoring function), yields scores for training ligands that are close to the known experimental values. Feasibility has been demon- strated in papers involving both membrane-bound receptors and enzymes.  However, multiple challenges remain and are the subject of the proposed research. There are three key issues. First, there exist many pocketmols that satisfy the requirements of fitting the training data, so general solutions must be developed to address the inductive bias of the learning procedure as well as model selection after the procedure. Second, since any particular model is the product of a learning process, it will have some domain of applicability, with some new molecules likely to be predicted well and others poorly. Further, the model will be better informed by learning with certain new molecules but not others. We must develop solutions for estimating confidence of predictions for new molecules as well as for identifying particular molecules that will be highly informative. Third, the operational application of these methods involves model building, guided chemical synthesis, and iterative refinement of models. Convincing validation will require application on temporal series of molecules synthesized for multiple targets of pharmaceutical interest. The proposed work will develop novel methods to address these challenges and will establish extensive validation on multiple pharmaceutically relevant temporal series of small molecules that were the subject of real-world lead-optimization exercises.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The dominant mode of therapeutic discovery involves the design ""me-too"" drugs that are very similar in structure and effect to existing drugs. In order to address the unmet medical needs of an aging population, novel therapeutics must be developed, and this will require much more creativity in the design process. The proposed research will develop a predictive computational framework to aid in active design of structurally novel drug molecules during the drug discovery lead optimization process.            ",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,8436505,R01GM101689,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Creativeness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Enzymes', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Series', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'blind', 'chemical synthesis', 'computer framework', 'design', 'design and construction', 'drug discovery', 'falls', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'small molecule', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2013,291402,-0.018276055767525518
"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.          We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.

"Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nanomaterial science, toxicology, cell biology, high throughput screening, biostatistics, mathematics and computer science with the overall goal of gaining fundamental understanding of how the physical and Chemical properties of carefully selected ENM libraries relate to interactions with cells and cellular structures, including how these bio-physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface may lead to pulmonary toxicity. This goal will be executed through the acquisition, synthesis and characterization of compositional and combinatorial ENM libraries that focus on the major physicochemical properties of nominated metal, metal oxide and silica nanoparticles {Scientific Core), hypothesized to play a role in pulmonary toxicity through the generation of oxidative stress, inflammation, signal pathway activation and membrane lysis. These efforts will be assisted by in silico modeling that use heatmaps, mathematical models and machine learning to perform hazard ranking and risk prediction. The major objectives of the Center are: (i) To establish an overarching predictive toxicological paradigm, which is defined as the assessment of in vivo toxic potential of ENM based on in vitro and in silico methods (integrated center effort); (ii) To establish rapid throughput cellular screening and conduct imaging to identify compositional and combinatorial ENM properties that lead to bioavailability and engagement of the injury pathways discussed above (Project 1); (iii) To establish through the performance of instillation and inhalation exposures in the rodent lung how the structure-property relationships linking ENM to in vitro injury mechanisms may be predictive of pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion (Project 2); (iv) To develop in silico toxicity models that utilize multivariate analysis of the rapid throughput screening and cellular imaging data to show the relationships that can be used to develop ""nano-QSARs"" for probabilistic risk ranking (Project 3).        We propose a center to study how properties of engineered nanomaterials may lead to lung health effects by creating harmful interactions in cells and tissues that will come into contact with these materials.

"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms. In total, our findings will yield tremendous insights into non-coding RNA biology and will substantially impact continued study of these important molecules.           We propose to develop computational methods to study novel non-coding RNA transcripts by leveraging a new duplex RNA sequencing technique. Our first objective is to develop a maximum likelihood algorithm that estimates secondary structure using double-stranded or single-stranded RNA sequencing. We will also develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features from RNA-seq experiments.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks  Project summary It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.

Recent studies have revealed that >90% of the genes undergo alternative splicing, which is believed to contribute to the complexity of the proteome in different cell types and tissues in vertebrates and abundant evidence suggests that altered splicing causes a variety of human diseases. Despite extensive knowledge on the splicing mechanism based on biochemical dissection of model minigenes, we know little about how many genes are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and where the functional RNA elements are embedded in the human genome. Built on our productive research in the current award period, we now propose a bold plan to systematically attack the critical gap of our knowledge about the regulation of alternative splicing. We will pursue three major lines of research by utilizing the latest and innovative genomics technologies. (1) We will use a new, automated platform recently developed in our lab to profile hundreds of conserved alternative splicing events against every annotated genes in the human genome. This unbiased approach will generate unprecedented information to uncover novel splicing regulators and deduce pathways in regulated splicing. (2) We will focus on RNA binding proteins involved in individual regulatory pathways to elucidate the molecular basis for regulated splicing by mapping their physical interactions with expressed RNA. For this purpose, we will construct a large panel of cell lines based on FLP-In 293 cells to express individual RNA binding proteins as a V5-tagged protein at the C- terminus, which will permit large-scale mapping of RNA-protein interactions by CLIP-seq (CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing) under a similar and optimized set of conditions. (3) Our third goal is to use the information generated from the proposed mapping and functional studies to develop an integrated framework for de novo prediction of splicing regulation by using machine-learning and graphical models. This research has the potential to fundamentally change our view on splicing control and its contribution to human disease. This RNA genomics project aims to deduce the splicing code in the human genome by systematic determination of genes involved in regulated splicing, elucidation of regulatory pathways, and RNA-protein interactions. The proposed research will use the latest genomics technologies to reveal functional RNA elements in the human genome, which will provide the molecular basis for many RNA-related human diseases.",Functional RNA elements in the human genome,8471148,R01HG004659,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Award', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cistrons', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exons', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost effective', 'crosslink', 'empowered', 'functional group', 'functional outcomes', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homologous recombination', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mRNA Precursor', 'mammalian genome', 'new technology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,649400,0.005272483350178659
"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia. In silico hit compounds will be experimentally validated and enter hit-to-lead optimization.

"Unlocking transcript diversity via differential analyses of splice graphs Abstract A most basic difference between cells of the same genotype and different phenotype lies in their transcriptome. Understanding the difference between two transcriptomes in terms of the RNA molecules present in each, or changes in abundance of specific molecules, can offer valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of disease, development, and specialization. High throughput sequencing provides a unique view of the transcriptome in the form of millions or even billions of short reads of nucleotide sequences sampled from the RNA molecules. To date, nearly 1000 such RNA-seq datasets have already been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. Beyond measuring differences in overall expression of genes between samples, there is a critical need to measure differences in expression at the transcript level. Computational tools that can extract significant changes in transcript diversity across populations with RNA-seq are in immediate demand. However, reconstructing the full extent of transcript isoforms from this wealth of data is not a solved problem because of fundamental ambiguities between isoforms at the scale of the short read samples.  We propose a novel approach to the differential analysis of transcriptomes that does not depend on the reconstruction of the full-length transcripts, and yet can accurately pinpoint the variation of transcriptomes. Our techniques are data-driven and applicable to any transcriptome, requiring only a reference genome, and do not depend on a priori gene structure annotations. Our research program builds on our highly sensitive and accurate MapSplice alignment algorithm to construct expression weighted splice graphs (ESG) from RNA-seq datasets. ESGs can be three orders of magnitude smaller in size than current RNA-seq datasets, yet fully represent the substantive biological content of such datasets. The ESG representation supports highly efficient analysis techniques that can directly identify and visualize statistically significant differential transcription between samples. Generalizations of the algorithms are proposed to identify co-regulated splicing patterns that are keys for biological pathway analyses and systems biology analyses.  We have established an ongoing interactive and collaborative research environment among the co-PIs and Co-Is which include the biologists, computer scientists and statistician. The proposed computational methods will be tested and refined using RNA-seq data generated from breast cancer cell lines before being further applied to three well curated RNA-seq datasets on lung cancer pathogenesis, stem cells in leukemia, and equine articular cartilage development and repair (a non-model mammalian organism). Experimental validation of differentially expressed transcript isoforms will both improve the accuracy of our methods, as well as propose novel candidates for alternative isoforms associated with lung cancer,and leukemia diseases, and chondrocyte differentiation.  The software will be open-source and will be developed as a set of components that can be used on their own or integrated into RNA-seq processing workflows. In particular we will integrate the components into the Galaxy cloud computing framework hosted on a local server. As such the methods will be available to researchers worldwide. As components mature they may be installed in other servers worldwide to provide a convenient and secure way to analyze transcriptomes.  Unveiling the dynamics of the transcriptome at modest cost will revolutionize cellular diagnostics and biomedical research. Genome-wide measurement of transcription variants offers the potential for detailed molecular information about cellular identity and function that will greatly expand traditional histological assessment. Cloud-based access to the methods can turn individual laboratories into small genome centers and will enable individual scientists to assess differences among RNA transcriptomes in a matter of days. Our suite of algorithms will enable biomedical researchers to prioritize candidate genes or different gene ontology categories to investigate further for differential transcription and mechanistic importance between experimental conditions. Project Narrative  This project will develop new techniques to compare the transcriptome of different cells, sampled using high-throughput sequencing technology. As the transcriptome consists of the RNA ""instructions"" controlling the cell's functions, differential analysis can provide detailed insight into the difference between healthy and diseased cells, or can be used to more clearly discover the functional differences between, say, liver cells and brain cells.",Unlocking transcript diversity via differential analyses of splice graphs,8473250,R01HG006272,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cancer cell line', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Categories', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chondrocytes', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equus caballus', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Galaxy', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Fusion', 'Gene Structure', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Hepatocyte', 'High Performance Computing', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'anticancer research', 'articular cartilage', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cartilage development', 'cartilage repair', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome annotation', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'meetings', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'statistics', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2013,395553,0.017869848443792802
"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain.          Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders. This proposal seeks to establish the interactions among selected RBPs and their functional RNA elements in mammalian neurons. This will be a crucial first step in elucidating the RNA networks regulated by these RBPs in the brain.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Determining the structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, as well as the first step in rational drug design.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.          We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.

"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale.

Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms.

"Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nanomaterial science, toxicology, cell biology, high throughput screening, biostatistics, mathematics and computer science with the overall goal of gaining fundamental understanding of how the physical and Chemical properties of carefully selected ENM libraries relate to interactions with cells and cellular structures, including how these bio-physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface may lead to pulmonary toxicity. This goal will be executed through the acquisition, synthesis and characterization of compositional and combinatorial ENM libraries that focus on the major physicochemical properties of nominated metal, metal oxide and silica nanoparticles {Scientific Core), hypothesized to play a role in pulmonary toxicity through the generation of oxidative stress, inflammation, signal pathway activation and membrane lysis.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RNA regulation is critical for the diversification of mammalian gene expression, organism complexity, and human diseases. The proposed study is to investigate the fundamentals of neuronal RNA complexity at the systems level, using a combination of high-throughput experimental technologies and novel integrative computational methods.

"Functional RNA elements in the human genome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-mRNA splicing is essential for proper gene expression in higher eukaryotic genomes, as the vast majority of genes contain introns that have to be accurately recognized and removed. Recent studies have revealed that >90% of the genes undergo alternative splicing, which is believed to contribute to the complexity of the proteome in different cell types and tissues in vertebrates and abundant evidence suggests that altered splicing causes a variety of human diseases. Despite extensive knowledge on the splicing mechanism based on biochemical dissection of model minigenes, we know little about how many genes are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and where the functional RNA elements are embedded in the human genome.  Built on our productive research in the current award period, we now propose a bold plan to systematically attack the critical gap of our knowledge about the regulation of alternative splicing. We will pursue three major lines of research by utilizing the latest and innovative genomics technologies. (1) We will use a new, automated platform recently developed in our lab to profile hundreds of conserved alternative splicing events against every annotated genes in the human genome. This unbiased approach will generate unprecedented information to uncover novel splicing regulators and deduce pathways in regulated splicing. (2) We will focus on RNA binding proteins involved in individual regulatory pathways to elucidate the molecular basis for regulated splicing by mapping their physical interactions with expressed RNA. For this purpose, we will construct a large panel of cell lines based on FLP-In 293 cells to express individual RNA binding proteins as a V5-tagged protein at the C- terminus, which will permit large-scale mapping of RNA-protein interactions by CLIP-seq (CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing) under a similar and optimized set of conditions. (3) Our third goal is to use the information generated from the proposed mapping and functional studies to develop an integrated framework for de novo prediction of splicing regulation by using machine-learning and graphical models. This research has the potential to fundamentally change our view on splicing control and its contribution to human disease.       This RNA genomics project aims to deduce the splicing code in the human genome by systematic determination of genes involved in regulated splicing, elucidation of regulatory pathways, and RNA-protein interactions. The proposed research will use the latest genomics technologies to reveal functional RNA elements in the human genome, which will provide the molecular basis for many RNA-related human diseases.",Functional RNA elements in the human genome,8326595,R01HG004659,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Award', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cistrons', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exons', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost effective', 'crosslink', 'empowered', 'functional group', 'functional outcomes', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homologous recombination', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mRNA Precursor', 'mammalian genome', 'new technology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2012,680000,0.005272483350178659
"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,8280335,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Syndrome', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'graduate student', 'meetings', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,288150,-0.030588125208647406
"Functional activity and inter-organismal interactions in the human microbiome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing has provided a tool capable of observing the human microbiome, but characterizing the biological roles and metabolic potential of these microbial communities remains a significant challenge. Increasing evidence points to the functional activity of gene products, rather than community taxonomic composition, as the most robust descriptor of the microflora's relationship with its host and as a potential point of intervention in modulating human health. Existing computational tools for exploring a newly sequenced metagenome rely heavily on sequence homology and do not yet leverage information from the thousands of publicly available functional experimental results. Likewise, no previous methods have provided genome-scale computational tools for biological hypothesis generation regarding specific molecular interactions among the microflora and with a human host. This proposal aims to develop computational methodology to interpret the functional activity of microfloral communities: 1. Integrate functional information from taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets. We will develop methodology to unify these three representations of microbiome composition by incorporating  information from large scale functional genomic data collections. 2. Identify genomic predictors of inter-species functional activity, including host/microflora interactions and points of community-wide regulatory feedback. We will computationally screen microbiome assays for molecular interactions and regulatory motifs spanning multiple organisms in the community. 3. Implement these technologies as publicly available, accessible, and interpretable tools. We will provide freely available, open source, downloadable and web-based implementations of this methodology for use  by the bioinformatic and biological communities. As high-throughput sequencing becomes more widely used to study microbial communities in the human microbiome and in the environment, computational tools will be necessary to summarize their global functional activity and systems-level regulatory interactions.

"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team. Project Narrative  Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the dynamics or underlying molecular principles of these machines is a challenge due to the highly cooperative nature of interactions, which simultaneously involve multiple molecules. The aim of this project is twofold: to develop and implement computational models and methods to improve our understanding of the collective dynamics of proteins; and to elucidate the machinery of molecular chaperones - molecular systems that play an essential role in cellular physiology by assisting the folding and assembly/disassembly of proteins and directing them to transport and degradation pathways.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

"Unlocking transcript diversity via differential analyses of splice graphs Abstract A most basic difference between cells of the same genotype and different phenotype lies in their transcriptome. Understanding the difference between two transcriptomes in terms of the RNA molecules present in each, or changes in abundance of specific molecules, can offer valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of disease, development, and specialization. High throughput sequencing provides a unique view of the transcriptome in the form of millions or even billions of short reads of nucleotide sequences sampled from the RNA molecules. To date, nearly 1000 such RNA-seq datasets have already been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. Beyond measuring differences in overall expression of genes between samples, there is a critical need to measure differences in expression at the transcript level. Computational tools that can extract significant changes in transcript diversity across populations with RNA-seq are in immediate demand. However, reconstructing the full extent of transcript isoforms from this wealth of data is not a solved problem because of fundamental ambiguities between isoforms at the scale of the short read samples.  We propose a novel approach to the differential analysis of transcriptomes that does not depend on the reconstruction of the full-length transcripts, and yet can accurately pinpoint the variation of transcriptomes. Our techniques are data-driven and applicable to any transcriptome, requiring only a reference genome, and do not depend on a priori gene structure annotations. Our research program builds on our highly sensitive and accurate MapSplice alignment algorithm to construct expression weighted splice graphs (ESG) from RNA-seq datasets. ESGs can be three orders of magnitude smaller in size than current RNA-seq datasets, yet fully represent the substantive biological content of such datasets. The ESG representation supports highly efficient analysis techniques that can directly identify and visualize statistically significant differential transcription between samples. Generalizations of the algorithms are proposed to identify co-regulated splicing patterns that are keys for biological pathway analyses and systems biology analyses.  We have established an ongoing interactive and collaborative research environment among the co-PIs and Co-Is which include the biologists, computer scientists and statistician. The proposed computational methods will be tested and refined using RNA-seq data generated from breast cancer cell lines before being further applied to three well curated RNA-seq datasets on lung cancer pathogenesis, stem cells in leukemia, and equine articular cartilage development and repair (a non-model mammalian organism). Experimental validation of differentially expressed transcript isoforms will both improve the accuracy of our methods, as well as propose novel candidates for alternative isoforms associated with lung cancer,and leukemia diseases, and chondrocyte differentiation.  The software will be open-source and will be developed as a set of components that can be used on their own or integrated into RNA-seq processing workflows. In particular we will integrate the components into the Galaxy cloud computing framework hosted on a local server. As such the methods will be available to researchers worldwide. As components mature they may be installed in other servers worldwide to provide a convenient and secure way to analyze transcriptomes.  Unveiling the dynamics of the transcriptome at modest cost will revolutionize cellular diagnostics and biomedical research. Genome-wide measurement of transcription variants offers the potential for detailed molecular information about cellular identity and function that will greatly expand traditional histological assessment. Cloud-based access to the methods can turn individual laboratories into small genome centers and will enable individual scientists to assess differences among RNA transcriptomes in a matter of days. Our suite of algorithms will enable biomedical researchers to prioritize candidate genes or different gene ontology categories to investigate further for differential transcription and mechanistic importance between experimental conditions. Project Narrative  This project will develop new techniques to compare the transcriptome of different cells, sampled using high-throughput sequencing technology. As the transcriptome consists of the RNA ""instructions"" controlling the cell's functions, differential analysis can provide detailed insight into the difference between healthy and diseased cells, or can be used to more clearly discover the functional differences between, say, liver cells and brain cells.",Unlocking transcript diversity via differential analyses of splice graphs,8296802,R01HG006272,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cancer cell line', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Categories', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chondrocytes', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equus caballus', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Galaxy', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Fusion', 'Gene Structure', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Hepatocyte', 'High Performance Computing', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'anticancer research', 'articular cartilage', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cartilage development', 'cartilage repair', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'meetings', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'statistics']",NHGRI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2012,425000,0.017869848443792802
"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RNA regulation is critical for the diversification of mammalian gene expression, organism complexity, and human diseases.

"Functional RNA elements in the human genome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-mRNA splicing is essential for proper gene expression in higher eukaryotic genomes, as the vast majority of genes contain introns that have to be accurately recognized and removed. Recent studies have revealed that >90% of the genes undergo alternative splicing, which is believed to contribute to the complexity of the proteome in different cell types and tissues in vertebrates and abundant evidence suggests that altered splicing causes a variety of human diseases. Despite extensive knowledge on the splicing mechanism based on biochemical dissection of model minigenes, we know little about how many genes are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and where the functional RNA elements are embedded in the human genome.  Built on our productive research in the current award period, we now propose a bold plan to systematically attack the critical gap of our knowledge about the regulation of alternative splicing. We will pursue three major lines of research by utilizing the latest and innovative genomics technologies. (1) We will use a new, automated platform recently developed in our lab to profile hundreds of conserved alternative splicing events against every annotated genes in the human genome. This unbiased approach will generate unprecedented information to uncover novel splicing regulators and deduce pathways in regulated splicing. (2) We will focus on RNA binding proteins involved in individual regulatory pathways to elucidate the molecular basis for regulated splicing by mapping their physical interactions with expressed RNA. For this purpose, we will construct a large panel of cell lines based on FLP-In 293 cells to express individual RNA binding proteins as a V5-tagged protein at the C- terminus, which will permit large-scale mapping of RNA-protein interactions by CLIP-seq (CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing) under a similar and optimized set of conditions. (3) Our third goal is to use the information generated from the proposed mapping and functional studies to develop an integrated framework for de novo prediction of splicing regulation by using machine-learning and graphical models.

The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.       	       n/a",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,8100430,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'meetings', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,288150,-0.030588125208647406
"Functional activity and inter-organismal interactions in the human microbiome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing has provided a tool capable of observing the human microbiome, but characterizing the biological roles and metabolic potential of these microbial communities remains a significant challenge. Increasing evidence points to the functional activity of gene products, rather than community taxonomic composition, as the most robust descriptor of the microflora's relationship with its host and as a potential point of intervention in modulating human health. Existing computational tools for exploring a newly sequenced metagenome rely heavily on sequence homology and do not yet leverage information from the thousands of publicly available functional experimental results. Likewise, no previous methods have provided genome-scale computational tools for biological hypothesis generation regarding specific molecular interactions among the microflora and with a human host. This proposal aims to develop computational methodology to interpret the functional activity of microfloral communities: 1. Integrate functional information from taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets. We will develop methodology to unify these three representations of microbiome composition by incorporating  information from large scale functional genomic data collections. 2. Identify genomic predictors of inter-species functional activity, including host/microflora interactions and points of community-wide regulatory feedback. We will computationally screen microbiome assays for molecular interactions and regulatory motifs spanning multiple organisms in the community. 3. Implement these technologies as publicly available, accessible, and interpretable tools. We will provide freely available, open source, downloadable and web-based implementations of this methodology for use  by the bioinformatic and biological communities. As high-throughput sequencing becomes more widely used to study microbial communities in the human microbiome and in the environment, computational tools will be necessary to summarize their global functional activity and systems-level regulatory interactions. In the long term, by providing methodology to understand the human microbiome at the molecular level, we hope to enable its future use as a diagnostic indicator and as a point of intervention to improve human health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful. Although we can now gather data on the cellular behavior of these microbes and on their interactions with human beings, computational tools are needed to interpret this information. By developing new software to study these communities of microorganisms, we hope to eventually be able to detect when they may be causing disease and modify their composition to improve human health.              2 Project Narrative DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful.

"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team. Project Narrative  Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the dynamics or underlying molecular principles of these machines is a challenge due to the highly cooperative nature of interactions, which simultaneously involve multiple molecules. The aim of this project is twofold: to develop and implement computational models and methods to improve our understanding of the collective dynamics of proteins; and to elucidate the machinery of molecular chaperones - molecular systems that play an essential role in cellular physiology by assisting the folding and assembly/disassembly of proteins and directing them to transport and degradation pathways.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data.

"Identification and characterization of non-coding RNAs in diverse bacteria My long-term goal is to become a leading independent investigator heading a truly interdisciplinary group that integrates cutting-edge bioinformatic approaches with innovative wet-bench methodologies to better understand RNA-mediated regulation, particularly in the context of bacterial pathogenesis. In the mentored phase of this award, I created and employed a high-throughput computational program called SIPHT to identify and annotate regulatory RNAs (regRNAs) and utilized data from cDNA deep sequencing experiments to determine a comprehensive profile of the V. cholerae small transcriptome. In the independent phase of the award, I plan to improve upon these computational and experimental approaches and to extend their application to a wider variety of bacterial species. Aim I is to develop an improved version of SIPHT that automatically updates its databases to enable regRNA predictions and annotations in newly sequenced strains and to incorporate newly identified regRNAs into predictive searches. Aim II Is to use Iterative SIPHT searches and machine learning techniques to improve the reliability of regRNA predictions and annotations. The studies proposed in Aim III have two main objectives. The first is to utilize massively parallel sequencing of the M. tuberculosis, V. cholerae, and P. aeruginosa transcriptomes to identify novel regRNAs and to elucidate RNA-mediated regulatory responses to specific environmental stresses and cues. The second is to develop bioinformatic algorithms to identify novel regRNAs from within the large datasets produced by deep sequencing techniques. Finally, Aim IV is to improve upon current predictive algorithms for trans-acting small regRNAs (sRNAs) by determining a consensus motif for the binding sites of the RNA chaperone Hfq and utilizing this motif in the search for previously unknown sRNAencoding genes. The proposed studies will likely lead to the discovery and functional annotation of numerous regRNAs. Moreover, the approaches described will be useful in the study of RNA-mediated regulation in a wide variety of bacterial species. Numerous recent studies have implicated a role for regRNAs in mediating the virulence of bacterial pathogens. Thus, identifying and characterizing regRNAs In a wider variety of species, in addition to providing insights Into myriad basic biological processes, will likely lead to a better understanding of microbial pathogenesis that may ultimately aid in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. n/a",Identification and characterization of non-coding RNAs in diverse bacteria,7924186,R00AI076608,"['Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Complementary DNA', 'Consensus', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Update', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Virulence', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'infectious disease treatment', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'research study', 'response']",NIAID,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R00,2010,246510,0.013505445598841571
"National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench.

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.       	       n/a",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,7895064,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'meetings', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,291060,-0.030588125208647406
"Functional activity and inter-organismal interactions in the human microbiome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing has provided a tool capable of observing the human microbiome, but characterizing the biological roles and metabolic potential of these microbial communities remains a significant challenge. Increasing evidence points to the functional activity of gene products, rather than community taxonomic composition, as the most robust descriptor of the microflora's relationship with its host and as a potential point of intervention in modulating human health. Existing computational tools for exploring a newly sequenced metagenome rely heavily on sequence homology and do not yet leverage information from the thousands of publicly available functional experimental results. Likewise, no previous methods have provided genome-scale computational tools for biological hypothesis generation regarding specific molecular interactions among the microflora and with a human host. This proposal aims to develop computational methodology to interpret the functional activity of microfloral communities: 1. Integrate functional information from taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets. We will develop methodology to unify these three representations of microbiome composition by incorporating  information from large scale functional genomic data collections. 2. Identify genomic predictors of inter-species functional activity, including host/microflora interactions and points of community-wide regulatory feedback. We will computationally screen microbiome assays for molecular interactions and regulatory motifs spanning multiple organisms in the community. 3. Implement these technologies as publicly available, accessible, and interpretable tools. We will provide freely available, open source, downloadable and web-based implementations of this methodology for use  by the bioinformatic and biological communities. As high-throughput sequencing becomes more widely used to study microbial communities in the human microbiome and in the environment, computational tools will be necessary to summarize their global functional activity and systems-level regulatory interactions. In the long term, by providing methodology to understand the human microbiome at the molecular level, we hope to enable its future use as a diagnostic indicator and as a point of intervention to improve human health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful. Although we can now gather data on the cellular behavior of these microbes and on their interactions with human beings, computational tools are needed to interpret this information. By developing new software to study these communities of microorganisms, we hope to eventually be able to detect when they may be causing disease and modify their composition to improve human health.              2 Project Narrative DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia.

"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team. Project Narrative  Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the dynamics or underlying molecular principles of these machines is a challenge due to the highly cooperative nature of interactions, which simultaneously involve multiple molecules. The aim of this project is twofold: to develop and implement computational models and methods to improve our understanding of the collective dynamics of proteins; and to elucidate the machinery of molecular chaperones - molecular systems that play an essential role in cellular physiology by assisting the folding and assembly/disassembly of proteins and directing them to transport and degradation pathways.

Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context.

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data.

"Machine Learning in Chemistry and Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Machine learning has broad applicability in the fields of chemistry and biology. This research effort is focused on empirical derivation of functions that are useful in the context of predicting aspects of molecular interaction between proteins and ligands. The characteristics of this problem offer unique challenges when approached from the perspective of machine learning, key among them being that the configuration in which molecules interact is not generally known. In the case of small molecule protein interactions, where it is possible to represent molecules as 3D objects, this is manifested in terms of hidden variables in the relative conformation and alignment of protein and ligand. Most machine learning tasks do not embed hidden variables in this fashion, but the problem is not insurmountable. We have implemented a number of methods which demonstrate that the problem of hidden variables is tractable, both methodologically in model induction and scoring function optimization as well as from the perspective of computational complexity in search. In this work, we will develop novel methods and refine existing methods in 3 problem areas: 1) Developing scoring functions for small molecule protein interactions with a known protein structure (the docking problem); 2) Developing quantitative models of small molecule activity against proteins with no known structure (the 3D QSAR problem); and 3) Developing methods for search and optimization that improve both model and scoring function induction and high-throughput application to large libraries of small molecules. The goal is to address the problem of prediction in a quantifiable way, which will allow both practical improvements in applications of the methods, and will also provide insight into the mechanistic aspects of the underlying physical molecular interactions.    All methods and data will be made widely available to both academic and industrial investigators.             n/a",Machine Learning in Chemistry and Biology,7931152,R01GM070481,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Covalent Interaction', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Goals', 'Ligands', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'flexibility', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'predictive modeling', 'protein structure', 'scaffold', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,235562,-0.052354143220653036
"Identification and characterization of non-coding RNAs in diverse bacteria My long-term goal is to become a leading independent investigator heading a truly interdisciplinary group that integrates cutting-edge bioinformatic approaches with innovative wet-bench methodologies to better understand RNA-mediated regulation, particularly in the context of bacterial pathogenesis. In the mentored phase of this award, I created and employed a high-throughput computational program called SIPHT to identify and annotate regulatory RNAs (regRNAs) and utilized data from cDNA deep sequencing experiments to determine a comprehensive profile of the V. cholerae small transcriptome. In the independent phase of the award, I plan to improve upon these computational and experimental approaches and to extend their application to a wider variety of bacterial species. Aim I is to develop an improved version of SIPHT that automatically updates its databases to enable regRNA predictions and annotations in newly sequenced strains and to incorporate newly identified regRNAs into predictive searches. Aim II Is to use Iterative SIPHT searches and machine learning techniques to improve the reliability of regRNA predictions and annotations. The studies proposed in Aim III have two main objectives. The first is to utilize massively parallel sequencing of the M. tuberculosis, V. cholerae, and P. aeruginosa transcriptomes to identify novel regRNAs and to elucidate RNA-mediated regulatory responses to specific environmental stresses and cues. The second is to develop bioinformatic algorithms to identify novel regRNAs from within the large datasets produced by deep sequencing techniques. Finally, Aim IV is to improve upon current predictive algorithms for trans-acting small regRNAs (sRNAs) by determining a consensus motif for the binding sites of the RNA chaperone Hfq and utilizing this motif in the search for previously unknown sRNAencoding genes. The proposed studies will likely lead to the discovery and functional annotation of numerous regRNAs. Moreover, the approaches described will be useful in the study of RNA-mediated regulation in a wide variety of bacterial species. Numerous recent studies have implicated a role for regRNAs in mediating the virulence of bacterial pathogens. Thus, identifying and characterizing regRNAs In a wider variety of species, in addition to providing insights Into myriad basic biological processes, will likely lead to a better understanding of microbial pathogenesis that may ultimately aid in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. n/a",Identification and characterization of non-coding RNAs in diverse bacteria,7907308,R00AI076608,"['Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Complementary DNA', 'Consensus', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Update', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Virulence', 'improved', 'infectious disease treatment', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'research study', 'response']",NIAID,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R00,2009,249000,0.013505445598841571

"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification. In particular, the project will develop methods for internally calibrating spectra, and will learn fragmentation patterns that can statistically distinguish different types of glycosidic linkages.         n/a",High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra,7628516,R01GM074128,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Carbon', 'Cartoons', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Genomics', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Human Genome', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monosaccharides', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Polysaccharides', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Work', 'cancer cell', 'egg', 'enzyme activity', 'experience', 'glycosylation', 'glycosyltransferase', 'high throughput analysis', 'immune function', 'improved', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sperm cell', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIGMS,PALO ALTO RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2009,329306,-0.008122988883550317
"Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics By Virtual High-Throughput Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier.      A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilts NIH-funded molecular libraries screening center network facility revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances whose activity was validated in independent experiments. The present ChemInformatics proposal targets utilizing the power of recent machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to model the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators reflected in the HTS results. An innovative encoding scheme is developed that allows mapping of the diverse chemical space into a single mathematical model. The resulting Quantitative Structure Activity Relation (QSAR) models will serve a three-fold purpose: (a) a comprehensive binding site pharmacophore will be obtained to facilitate understanding of the SAR and rationalize further experiments; (b) the models will be used to virtually screen libraries of millions of compounds which are known but not physically available for HTS at Vanderbilt to gain a priority list for acquisition or synthesis; and (c) in combination with an existing Genetic Algorithm (GA) structure generator existing lead compounds will be optimized and new structures will be designed to identify potential new targets for synthesis.      Overall we hope to not only identify novel allosteric potentiators of mGluR5 and understand their activity as potential treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function, but also to build an innovative ChemInformatics software and database tool which can be adopted for research in other NIH molecular libraries screening centers. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research using a WWW interface deeply integrated in the drug development pipeline. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target protein. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      The PI of the proposal has extensive experience in the usage of ANNs and SVMs to predict properties of organic molecules and proteins (1-9), solve protein structures (10-15), and predict activity of therapeutics (16). He implemented GAs for the design and optimization of chemical structures (17,18).

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.       	       n/a",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,7787322,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'meetings', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,294000,-0.030588125208647406
"Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions: Computational Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cocaine inhibition of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters is responsible for the addictive properties of this potent illicit compound. A molecular model of the cocaine neurotransmitter transporter complex would promote understanding of the addictive nature of cocaine and accelerate development of therapeutics for psychiatric treatment of cocaine addiction. Recent developments in the neurotransmitter transporter field present a unique opportunity to develop an accurate model of cocaine interactions with neurotransmitter transporters. The recent report of a high-resolution crystal structure of a leucine transporter, the first member in the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family of proteins, enables reliable structural interpretation of functional data for human dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters. This structure, combined with the currently available sequences for the NSS family and the datasets for cocaine-derived inhibitors of serotonin and dopamine transporters, give the means to create an accurate model for cocaine neurotransmitter transporter interactions. This project takes a two-pronged approach to modeling the cocaine neurotransmitter complexes. First, evolutionary conserved structural and functional constraints evolutionary will be extracted using ""evolutionary trace"" and ""statistical coupling analysis"" methods on available neurotransmitter transporter sequences. This will identify networks of residues responsible for the diverse functionalities observed in neurotransmitter transporters. Second, protein computational modeling techniques will be used to build comparative models off the leucine transporter structure, and then to predict modes of interaction for cocaine and cocaine analogs. The models can then be filtered and refined based on available biological data. Out of this project, the resulting atomic resolution models of cocaine and its analogs bound to dopamine and serotonin transporter will explain and predict the efficacy of new therapeutics for treatment of cocaine addiction. In short, the molecular models of cocaine bound to serotonin or dopamine transporter would provide a critical advancement for investigating and understanding cocaine and its neuro-chemical effects.            n/a",Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions: Computational Studies,7658677,F31DA024528,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Chemicals', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Dopamine', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Leucine', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sodium', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substance of Abuse', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analog', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'design', 'dopamine transporter', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'serotonin transporter', 'small molecule', 'symporter', 'therapeutic development', 'tool']",NIDA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,28202,-0.03526681468654429
"Structural Dynamics of Biomolecular Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the principles that control the machinery of biomolecular systems is a computational challenge in many cases due to the involvement of macromolecular structures composed of multiple subunits and cooperative interactions manifested by allosteric changes in conformations, which are beyond the range of atomic simulations. Our goal in a recently funded R33 has been to develop and utilize low resolution models for exploring the collective dynamics of such complex systems, and bridging between structure and function, based on the paradigm structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The elastic network models and methods we introduced to this aim have found utility in many applications and helped us gain insights into the intrinsic, structure- encoded ability of proteins to favor the reconfiguration of native structures between functional substates. In the present R01, we are proposing to build on our previous work, to further explore the structure -> dynamics -> function mapping of allosteric and/or multimeric proteins using physically-based and computationally efficient models in collaboration with the NCBC Simbios at Stanford U (PI: Altman). The Simbios group has already started to construct a new simulation package, Simbody, the utility of which is expected to be significantly enhanced by a collaborative work. Our specific aims are (1) to build models and methods for automated coarse-graining of complex structures at multiple levels of resolution and assessing their collective dynamics, toward using the resulting models (structure) and data (motions) in Simbody; (2) to complement the physics-based approach developed in Aim 1 by information-theoretic approaches toward delineating signal transduction pathways/mechanisms in allosteric systems, and establishing the connection between these pathways and structural dynamics, and (3) to gain insights into the machinery of molecular chaperones, using as prototypes the bacterial chaperonin GroEL-GroES and the DnaK chaperone system, in collaboration with the Gierasch lab currently doing NIH-supported experiments for understanding the allosteric dynamics of the DnaK system. An important outcome of this project will be the establishment of a methodology for simulating the machinery of biomolecular systems on the order of Megadaltons, which will be achieved in collaboration with the Schulten lab, in addition to our partnership with the Simbios team. Project Narrative Many proteins function as molecular machines. Understanding the dynamics or underlying molecular principles of these machines is a challenge due to the highly cooperative nature of interactions, which simultaneously involve multiple molecules. The aim of this project is twofold: to develop and implement computational models and methods to improve our understanding of the collective dynamics of proteins; and to elucidate the machinery of molecular chaperones - molecular systems that play an essential role in cellular physiology by assisting the folding and assembly/disassembly of proteins and directing them to transport and degradation pathways.

"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7850408,R01EB006200,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Drug Industry', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Price', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reader', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'charge coupled device camera', 'discount', 'drug discovery', 'empowered', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'knowledge base', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'response', 'small molecule libraries', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2009,26557,-0.004344741744167369

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Determining the structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, as well as the first step in rational drug design.

"Machine Learning in Chemistry and Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Machine learning has broad applicability in the fields of chemistry and biology. This research effort is focused on empirical derivation of functions that are useful in the context of predicting aspects of molecular interaction between proteins and ligands. The characteristics of this problem offer unique challenges when approached from the perspective of machine learning, key among them being that the configuration in which molecules interact is not generally known. In the case of small molecule protein interactions, where it is possible to represent molecules as 3D objects, this is manifested in terms of hidden variables in the relative conformation and alignment of protein and ligand. Most machine learning tasks do not embed hidden variables in this fashion, but the problem is not insurmountable. We have implemented a number of methods which demonstrate that the problem of hidden variables is tractable, both methodologically in model induction and scoring function optimization as well as from the perspective of computational complexity in search. In this work, we will develop novel methods and refine existing methods in 3 problem areas: 1) Developing scoring functions for small molecule protein interactions with a known protein structure (the docking problem); 2) Developing quantitative models of small molecule activity against proteins with no known structure (the 3D QSAR problem); and 3) Developing methods for search and optimization that improve both model and scoring function induction and high-throughput application to large libraries of small molecules. The goal is to address the problem of prediction in a quantifiable way, which will allow both practical improvements in applications of the methods, and will also provide insight into the mechanistic aspects of the underlying physical molecular interactions.

"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases. An understanding of the rules that govern the recognition of splice sites should help in the design of therapeutic intervention strategies to reverse such ill effects.                           n/a",Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing,7469442,R01GM072740,"['Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Class', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Dependence', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear RNA', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Introns', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'falls', 'genetic selection', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'size', 'solid state']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2008,291756,-0.018456226103993553
"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification. In particular, the project will develop methods for internally calibrating spectra, and will learn fragmentation patterns that can statistically distinguish different types of glycosidic linkages.         n/a",High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra,7431760,R01GM074128,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Carbon', 'Cartoons', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Class', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Genomics', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Human Genome', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monosaccharides', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Occupations', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Polysaccharides', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Range', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Title', 'Training', 'Work', 'cancer cell', 'egg', 'enzyme activity', 'experience', 'glycosylation', 'glycosyltransferase', 'high throughput analysis', 'immune function', 'improved', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sperm cell', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIGMS,PALO ALTO RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2008,329296,-0.008122988883550317
"A Simulation Tool to Enable Identification of Critical Network Interactions Using    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the main challenges in the discovery of intracellular biomarkers and identification of therapeutic targets is the lack of a mechanistic understanding of the complex underlying pathways. The tremendous increase in both the quantity and diversity of cellular data represents a significant challenge to researchers seeking to construct biologically relevant interaction maps, and objectively extract specific actionable information. Machine learning based clustering algorithms serve as a preliminary statistical data analysis metric, but they fail to capture the data in the proper biological context. While chemical kinetics based models have proved to be effective in elucidating the pathway mechanisms, accurate estimates for the model parameters are severely lacking and are often impossible to obtain owing to the inherent difficulties involved in making dynamic measurements of specific intracellular phenomena. Additionally, methods for rational prioritization and selection of critical intracellular interactions (in the absence of kinetic information) are sorely lacking. Therefore, there is a clear need for innovative software tools that enable quantitative analysis of available microarray data in a biological pathway context, ultimately leading to the objective identification of critical biological interactions, providing a direction for more focused future efforts. We propose to address this challenge by developing an automated software platform that utilizes microarray data to select and merge relevant canonical biological pathway models thereby placing significantly expressed genes in their biological context. The analysis software will utilize a microarray expression-weighted metric to objectively rank the most critical interactions within the network model using a novel chemical kinetics-free Boolean dynamics algorithm. In the Phase I effort, we will develop a software tool composed of an R library that enables the automated generation of a pathway model from a given microarray dataset. Additionally, a methodology, and associated R library will be developed to objectively rank critical interactions in the pathway model, using a microarray data expression-weighted metric. Demonstration and validation of proposed algorithm will be carried out using a well characterized lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage system. In Phase II, we will extend the scope of the algorithmic framework to include proteomic and metabolomic weighting in the objective ranking of critical interactions, and add workflow improvements through the addition of a graphical user interface (GUI). Experimental verification and validation of critical interactions identified in Phase I will be carried out using gene-silencing techniques. We also intend to establish collaborative partnerships with commercial entities. The proposing team has extensive experience in the areas of systems biology and bioinformatics (CFDRC) and microarray data analysis (Shawn Levy, University of Vanderbilt). CFDRC has a strong track record in the commercialization of software and hardware. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Recently, there has been a tremendous increase in both the amount and diversity of cellular data available to researchers, representing a clear need for the development of advanced computational analysis software to enable the discovery of biomarkers of disease states, and identification of new therapeutic targets. However, currently available analysis tools do not consider the data in a proper biological context.

"Nation Center: Multi-Scale Study- Cellular Networks(RMI) A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genomewide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context.

We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench.

"Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics By Virtual High-Throughput Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier.      A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilts NIH-funded molecular libraries screening center network facility revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances whose activity was validated in independent experiments. The present ChemInformatics proposal targets utilizing the power of recent machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to model the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators reflected in the HTS results. An innovative encoding scheme is developed that allows mapping of the diverse chemical space into a single mathematical model. The resulting Quantitative Structure Activity Relation (QSAR) models will serve a three-fold purpose: (a) a comprehensive binding site pharmacophore will be obtained to facilitate understanding of the SAR and rationalize further experiments; (b) the models will be used to virtually screen libraries of millions of compounds which are known but not physically available for HTS at Vanderbilt to gain a priority list for acquisition or synthesis; and (c) in combination with an existing Genetic Algorithm (GA) structure generator existing lead compounds will be optimized and new structures will be designed to identify potential new targets for synthesis.      Overall we hope to not only identify novel allosteric potentiators of mGluR5 and understand their activity as potential treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function, but also to build an innovative ChemInformatics software and database tool which can be adopted for research in other NIH molecular libraries screening centers. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research using a WWW interface deeply integrated in the drug development pipeline. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target protein. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      The PI of the proposal has extensive experience in the usage of ANNs and SVMs to predict properties of organic molecules and proteins (1-9), solve protein structures (10-15), and predict activity of therapeutics (16).

"Classification Algorithms for Chemical Compounds Computational techniques that build models to correctly assign chemical compounds to various classes of interests have extensive applications in pharmaceutical research and are used extensively at various phases during the drug development process.

"Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions:Computational Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cocaine inhibition of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters is responsible for the addictive properties of this potent illicit compound. A molecular model of the cocaine neurotransmitter transporter complex would promote understanding of the addictive nature of cocaine and accelerate development of therapeutics for psychiatric treatment of cocaine addiction. Recent developments in the neurotransmitter transporter field present a unique opportunity to develop an accurate model of cocaine interactions with neurotransmitter transporters. The recent report of a high-resolution crystal structure of a leucine transporter, the first member in the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family of proteins, enables reliable structural interpretation of functional data for human dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters. This structure, combined with the currently available sequences for the NSS family and the datasets for cocaine-derived inhibitors of serotonin and dopamine transporters, give the means to create an accurate model for cocaine neurotransmitter transporter interactions. This project takes a two-pronged approach to modeling the cocaine neurotransmitter complexes. First, evolutionary conserved structural and functional constraints evolutionary will be extracted using ""evolutionary trace"" and ""statistical coupling analysis"" methods on available neurotransmitter transporter sequences. This will identify networks of residues responsible for the diverse functionalities observed in neurotransmitter transporters. Second, protein computational modeling techniques will be used to build comparative models off the leucine transporter structure, and then to predict modes of interaction for cocaine and cocaine analogs. The models can then be filtered and refined based on available biological data. Out of this project, the resulting atomic resolution models of cocaine and its analogs bound to dopamine and serotonin transporter will explain and predict the efficacy of new therapeutics for treatment of cocaine addiction. In short, the molecular models of cocaine bound to serotonin or dopamine transporter would provide a critical advancement for investigating and understanding cocaine and its neuro-chemical effects.            n/a",Cocaine Neurotransmitter-Transporter Interactions:Computational Studies,7546079,F31DA024528,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Chemicals', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Dopamine', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Leucine', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sodium', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substance of Abuse', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'analog', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer studies', 'concept', 'design', 'dopamine transporter', 'experience', 'human data', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'serotonin transporter', 'small molecule', 'symporter', 'tool']",NIDA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2008,32027,-0.03526681468654429
"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays.

"System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the NIH call for Exploratory Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing, PAR-06-223, and it will involve a collaboration between Columbia University's MAGNet NCBC and a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The aim of the proposal is a system-wide tudy of integrated transcriptional and metabolic networks in Eschericia coli K-12 strain, aiming at a similar analysis of a pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, at a later date. LANL hosts an experimental research program on bacterial metabolomics. Metabolites serve several functions. The most common one is being the precursors to various cellular components. They are also regulators of cellular functions by means of modulating metabolic reactions or binding to transcription factors and subsequently regulating gene expression. Conversely, the genes regulated by a transcription factor often encode enzymes, modulating the speed of metabolic reactions. Thus, to understand and ultimately predict the cellular response to an environmental change of interest (e.g., pathogen entry into its host environment), we must integrate the analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. To address this need, we will work with the laboratories of Pat Unkefer and John Dunbar, which will produce data sets of about 300 joint metabolic/transcriptional profiles of E.coli under different steady-state growth conditions. The resources of MAGnet NCBC, specifically the algorithms within the geWorkbench bioinformatics platform produced by the center, will be leveraged to reconstruct cellular networks. Specifically, we expect that ARACNE, an algorithm originally developed by MAGNet for high-fidelity analysis of transcriptional networks in mammalian cells, is well positioned for reconstruction of metabolic networks from high throughput system-wide metabolic activity data, provide that appropriate modifications to deal with the specifics of the metabolic data are made.

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments. Our ""biological maps"" will enable the visualization of evolutionary forces driving changes in the parasite's phenotype and should allow us to identify network design weaknesses in the parasite--potential vulnerabilities that could result in new malarial control strategies.           n/a",Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models,7483692,SC1AI080579,"['Animal Model', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Be++ element', 'Beryllium', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digestion', 'Discipline', 'Drug resistance', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Endopeptidases', 'Engineering', 'Family', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hemoglobin', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'driving force', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'research study', 'response', 'stem', 'theories', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC1,2008,242920,-0.010983641867725907
"National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases. Development will be both driven and tested by the biomedical community to ensure the usefulness of the tools and the usability of the graphical user interfaces to address biomedical problems in completely novel ways, to dissect the web of cellular interactions responsible for cellular processes and functions.         n/a",National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI),7502135,U54CA121852,[' '],NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U54,2008,3570137,0.02777683862533414
"Machine Learning in Chemistry and Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Machine learning has broad applicability in the fields of chemistry and biology. This research effort is focused on empirical derivation of functions that are useful in the context of predicting aspects of molecular interaction between proteins and ligands. The characteristics of this problem offer unique challenges when approached from the perspective of machine learning, key among them being that the configuration in which molecules interact is not generally known. In the case of small molecule protein interactions, where it is possible to represent molecules as 3D objects, this is manifested in terms of hidden variables in the relative conformation and alignment of protein and ligand. Most machine learning tasks do not embed hidden variables in this fashion, but the problem is not insurmountable. We have implemented a number of methods which demonstrate that the problem of hidden variables is tractable, both methodologically in model induction and scoring function optimization as well as from the perspective of computational complexity in search. In this work, we will develop novel methods and refine existing methods in 3 problem areas: 1) Developing scoring functions for small molecule protein interactions with a known protein structure (the docking problem); 2) Developing quantitative models of small molecule activity against proteins with no known structure (the 3D QSAR problem); and 3) Developing methods for search and optimization that improve both model and scoring function induction and high-throughput application to large libraries of small molecules. The goal is to address the problem of prediction in a quantifiable way, which will allow both practical improvements in applications of the methods, and will also provide insight into the mechanistic aspects of the underlying physical molecular interactions.

"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification. In particular, the project will develop methods for internally calibrating spectra, and will learn fragmentation patterns that can statistically distinguish different types of glycosidic linkages.         n/a",High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra,7239477,R01GM074128,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Carbon', 'Cartoons', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Class', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Genomics', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Human Genome', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monosaccharides', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Occupations', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Polysaccharides', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Range', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Title', 'Training', 'Work', 'cancer cell', 'egg', 'enzyme activity', 'experience', 'glycosylation', 'glycosyltransferase', 'high throughput analysis', 'immune function', 'improved', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sperm cell', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIGMS,PALO ALTO RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2007,318904,-0.008122988883550317
"Assembly and Function of Mammalian Centrosomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The centrosome is a major microtubule-organizing center responsible for initiation of microtubule assembly in animal cells. Microtubules are important for such processes as mitosis/meiosis, cell motility, and morphogenesis, thus centrosome dysfunction causes serious human diseases, including cancers, metastasis, and birth defects. The overall aim of this application is to understand how assembly and function of the centrosome are controlled at the molecular level. The research focuses on three centrosome proteins: Aurora-A, CNN, and Cep135. A mitosis-specific kinase, Aurora-A is involved in centrosome maturation during cell division. It binds to CNN (centrosomin), which has unique properties to induce microtubule-nucleating sites through interacting with the gamma-tubulin complex. CNN also binds to a highly coiled-coiled protein, Cep135 important for maintaining the structural integrity of the centrosome. The first specific aim is to determine how the CNN activity to form microtubule-nucleating sites is controlled by Aurora-A. Effects of the change in CNN interaction with Aurora-A and its phosphorylation by the Aurora-A kinase will be examined. Additional CNN- and Aurora-A-interacting molecules will be searched using a combined two-hybrid screens and functional RNAi assays. The second objective is to dissect molecules involved in organization of microtubule-nucleating sites. Microtubule formation onto cytoplasmic assemblies induced by CNN overexpression will be characterized in vivo and in vitro. Proteins required for microtubule nucleation will be identified by in vitro tests of microtubule polymerization onto isolated CNN assemblies from which different molecules are stripped off and added back. Attempts will be made to polymerize microtubules onto microbeads coated with CNN and other potential molecules. The third objective is to examine assembly of mammalian centrosomes by supplementing Cep135-depleted cells with exogenous Cep135 and CNN. The process of disintegration and reformation of the functional centrosome will be monitored by fluorescence and electron microscopy. The Aurora-A gene is a tumor-susceptibility gene and its overexpression causes cancer formation. As centrosome abnormalities are implicated in the origin of chromosome instability and cancer pathogenesis, the study will be useful in establishing strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human cancers.       n/a",Assembly and Function of Mammalian Centrosomes,7102736,R01GM055735,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'C-terminal', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell division', 'Cells', 'Centrosome', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Diagnosis', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meiosis', 'Microspheres', 'Microtubule Polymerization', 'Microtubule-Organizing Center', 'Microtubules', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic spindle', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Overexpression', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Site', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tubulin', 'Work', 'aurora-A kinase', 'cell motility', 'gamma Tubulin', 'human STK6 protein', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'mutant', 'protein distribution', 'reconstitution', 'research study', 'scaffold', 'tumor', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2007,211207,-0.01818652646299611
"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems.

While important in its own right, especially in view of the pathogenic nature of B. anthracis, this research would also represent an important test bed for a subsequent study of metabolic diseases in higher animals, including humans.           n/a",System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism,7234993,R21GM080216,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacillus anthracis', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Concentration measurement', 'Condition', 'Crystallography', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Gene', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multimedia', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical informatics', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forging', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2007,257655,-0.012529674450284231
"National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases. Development will be both driven and tested by the biomedical community to ensure the usefulness of the tools and the usability of the graphical user interfaces to address biomedical problems in completely novel ways, to dissect the web of cellular interactions responsible for cellular processes and functions.         n/a",National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI),7286779,U54CA121852,[' '],NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U54,2007,3638557,0.02777683862533414
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments. Our ""biological maps"" will enable the visualization of evolutionary forces driving changes in the parasite's phenotype and should allow us to identify network design weaknesses in the parasite--potential vulnerabilities that could result in new malarial control strategies.           n/a",Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models,7287978,SC1GM081068,"['Animal Model', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Be++ element', 'Beryllium', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digestion', 'Discipline', 'Drug resistance', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Endopeptidases', 'Engineering', 'Family', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hemoglobin', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'driving force', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'research study', 'response', 'stem', 'theories', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC1,2007,247625,-0.010983641867725907
"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases. An understanding of the rules that govern the recognition of splice sites should help in the design of therapeutic intervention strategies to reverse such ill effects.                           n/a",Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing,7261326,R01GM072740,[' '],NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2007,290853,-0.018456226103993553

"Machine Learning in Chemistry and Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Machine learning has broad applicability in the fields of chemistry and biology. This research effort is focused on empirical derivation of functions that are useful in the context of predicting aspects of molecular interaction between proteins and ligands. The characteristics of this problem offer unique challenges when approached from the perspective of machine learning, key among them being that the configuration in which molecules interact is not generally known. In the case of small molecule protein interactions, where it is possible to represent molecules as 3D objects, this is manifested in terms of hidden variables in the relative conformation and alignment of protein and ligand. Most machine learning tasks do not embed hidden variables in this fashion, but the problem is not insurmountable. We have implemented a number of methods which demonstrate that the problem of hidden variables is tractable, both methodologically in model induction and scoring function optimization as well as from the perspective of computational complexity in search. In this work, we will develop novel methods and refine existing methods in 3 problem areas: 1) Developing scoring functions for small molecule protein interactions with a known protein structure (the docking problem); 2) Developing quantitative models of small molecule activity against proteins with no known structure (the 3D QSAR problem); and 3) Developing methods for search and optimization that improve both model and scoring function induction and high-throughput application to large libraries of small molecules. The goal is to address the problem of prediction in a quantifiable way, which will allow both practical improvements in applications of the methods, and will also provide insight into the mechanistic aspects of the underlying physical molecular interactions.

"Support Vector Machine modeling software for improving RNAi efficacy prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Title Support vector machines predict sequence ~ activity relationships in RNA interference: Project Summary/Abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a group of algorithms in supervised machine learning that are able to build classification or regression models on training data such that these models can be used to predict information not seen during model construction. RNA interference (RNAi) is the property of small (20 to 23 bases) RNA sequences that with the help of the RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) enable the catalytic cleavage of target RNA sequences and the knockdown of the expression level of the target gene. The steps involved in loading and associating an RNAi sequences into an active RISC are several in addition to the multi-factorial variation in biochemical activities of RNAi sequences once in an active RISC. Finding the relevant biochemical features that associate with these quantifiable measures of RNAi can allow i) better predictive models of RNAi and RNAi-like (e.g. microRNAs) activities and ii) a better understanding of the relevant biochemical properties since presumably less relevant properties should not increase the predictive abilities of models containing those properties. We have developed a novel feature mapping method, referred to as Binary Base mapping, that improves the ability of a SVM to predict RNAi activities when compared to 2 previous methods, refered to as Unit Vector and N-gram mapping. Alone, the Binary Base SVM method has greater predictive accuracy than a recently published neural network machine learning method, on the same training and testing data. Several additional mapping methods can be envisioned, including methods that incorporate RNAi thermodynamics, secondary structure or measures of entropy, and whether alone or in combination these mappings of sequence to vector space for SVM model construction lead to better predictive models or understanding of RNAi biochemistry is unknown. We are requesting funding for the specific aims of: i) testing whether the Binary Base method can be used to further dissect and identify relevant biochemical feature associated with RNAi activity, ii) analyzing what additional vector mapping methods lead to predictive models with increased accuracy or greater understanding of relevant biochemical properties, and iii) investigating the distribution of sites within and among target mRNA genes where predictive SVM models identify high versus low activity. Title Support vector machines predict sequence ~ activity relationships in RNA interference: Project Narrative: Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) have regulatory influence in human development and disease and better understanding how these molecules function involves the development of predictive models. Machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are 1 way to develop predictive models for these small RNA sequences and the incorporation of novel mapping methods in SVMs leads to model improvement. Finding and combining additional sequence mapping methods can lead to better predictive models for RNA interference activity as well as related processes such as microRNA activity, chemical modification of RNAi and RNAi stability or RNAi toxicity; further improving the understanding of how scnRNAs function and how they might be regulated.          n/a",Support Vector Machine modeling software for improving RNAi efficacy prediction,7157547,R43GM079132,"['RNA interference', 'biotechnology', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'gene targeting', 'genetic mapping', 'mathematical model', 'messenger RNA', 'method development', 'molecular genetics', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleic acid structure', 'thermodynamics']",NIGMS,"INTEGRATED DNA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2006,97773,0.029310393344283748
"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification. In particular, the project will develop methods for internally calibrating spectra, and will learn fragmentation patterns that can statistically distinguish different types of glycosidic linkages.         n/a",High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra,7071180,R01GM074128,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'chemical structure', 'chemical synthesis', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'glycosylation', 'high throughput technology', 'mass spectrometry', 'mathematics', 'matrix assisted laser desorption ionization', 'polysaccharides', 'structural biology', 'technology /technique development']",NIGMS,PALO ALTO RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2006,324279,-0.008122988883550317

"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases.

"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7125565,R01EB006200,"['NIH Roadmap Initiative tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biotechnology', 'charge coupled device camera', 'computer program /software', 'computer system hardware', 'high throughput technology', 'image enhancement', 'robotics']",NIBIB,SANFORD-BURNHAM MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTIT,R01,2006,399410,-0.004344741744167369
"Machine Learning in Chemistry and Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Machine learning has broad applicability in the fields of chemistry and biology. This research effort is focused on empirical derivation of functions that are useful in the context of predicting aspects of molecular interaction between proteins and ligands. The characteristics of this problem offer unique challenges when approached from the perspective of machine learning, key among them being that the configuration in which molecules interact is not generally known. In the case of small molecule protein interactions, where it is possible to represent molecules as 3D objects, this is manifested in terms of hidden variables in the relative conformation and alignment of protein and ligand. Most machine learning tasks do not embed hidden variables in this fashion, but the problem is not insurmountable. We have implemented a number of methods which demonstrate that the problem of hidden variables is tractable, both methodologically in model induction and scoring function optimization as well as from the perspective of computational complexity in search. In this work, we will develop novel methods and refine existing methods in 3 problem areas: 1) Developing scoring functions for small molecule protein interactions with a known protein structure (the docking problem); 2) Developing quantitative models of small molecule activity against proteins with no known structure (the 3D QSAR problem); and 3) Developing methods for search and optimization that improve both model and scoring function induction and high-throughput application to large libraries of small molecules. The goal is to address the problem of prediction in a quantifiable way, which will allow both practical improvements in applications of the methods, and will also provide insight into the mechanistic aspects of the underlying physical molecular interactions.    All methods and data will be made widely available to both academic and industrial investigators.             n/a",Machine Learning in Chemistry and Biology,6965574,R01GM070481,"['artificial intelligence', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'high throughput technology', 'intermolecular interaction', 'ligands', 'method development', 'molecular dynamics', 'problem solving', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'small molecule']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R01,2005,279983,-0.052354143220653036
"Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   To date, post-genomic analysis has focused on identification and annotation of protein-coding genes and their products. In comparison, the identification of DNA sequences encoding functional RNA has been largely neglected. Functional RNAs can encode trans-acting molecules that interact with other RNAs or proteins, such as tRNAs, rRNAs, RNaseP RNA, small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs; they can also function in cis as untranslated regions that regulate post-transcriptional expression of mRNAs. Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that there may be hundreds of unknown functional RNAs in prokaryotes and thousands in eukaryotes.      The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a computational approach to the identification of novel RNA genes and functional RNA elements in complete DNA genomes. Machine learning techniques will be used to recognize hallmarks of functional RNA coding sequences by comparison with sequences that do not encode RNAs. Several types of signals are useful in discriminating functional RNA including: 1) differences in global sequence composition, 2) calculated RNA secondary structure features, i.e. free energy of folding and 3) specific sequence elements common to RNA structure. These and other parameters can be rapidly tried and tested using machine learning methods. This method will be optimized for individual genomes with respect to input databases, parameterization and machine learning method and architecture. Results will be evaluated computationally by cross-validation testing, comparative genomics, and calculated secondary structure and free energy of folding. Experimental studies of RNA expression and function will be conducted in conjunction with collaborators.      Preliminary studies have demonstrated the power of this approach to predict novel functional RNAs in E. coli, other bacteria and archaea as supported by computational cross-validation and experimental confirmation. We will test and apply this approach to discover new functional RNAs in eukaryotic genomes including S. cervisiae, C. elegans, and humans. RNA prediction for these larger and more complex genomes will require the optimization of computational parameters, as well as the development of appropriate input datasets and training algorithms.      The prediction of novel functional RNAs in the human genome presents an opportunity to understand new regulatory and developmental processes. Known RNAs implicated in human disease, such as telomerase RNA (cancer, aging), XIST RNA (X-chromosome inactivation) and BIC (a proto-oncogene) underscore the importance of developing a method to identify the full complement of human RNA genes.         n/a",Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences,6891680,R01HG002665,"['Archaea', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Escherichia coli', 'RNA', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'animal genetic material tag', 'artificial intelligence', 'biotechnology', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'eukaryote', 'functional /structural genomics', 'genetic library', 'genetic mapping', 'human genetic material tag', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid quantitation /detection', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleic acid structure', 'prokaryote', 'technology /technique development']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2005,377162,0.041767741017860655
"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification. In particular, the project will develop methods for internally calibrating spectra, and will learn fragmentation patterns that can statistically distinguish different types of glycosidic linkages.         n/a",High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra,6916805,R01GM074128,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'chemical structure', 'chemical synthesis', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'glycosylation', 'high throughput technology', 'mass spectrometry', 'mathematics', 'matrix assisted laser desorption ionization', 'polysaccharides', 'structural biology', 'technology /technique development']",NIGMS,PALO ALTO RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2005,353067,-0.008122988883550317
"Assembly and Function of Mammalian Centrosomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The centrosome is a major microtubule-organizing center responsible for initiation of microtubule assembly in animal cells. Microtubules are important for such processes as mitosis/meiosis, cell motility, and morphogenesis, thus centrosome dysfunction causes serious human diseases, including cancers, metastasis, and birth defects. The overall aim of this application is to understand how assembly and function of the centrosome are controlled at the molecular level. The research focuses on three centrosome proteins: Aurora-A, CNN, and Cep135. A mitosis-specific kinase, Aurora-A is involved in centrosome maturation during cell division. It binds to CNN (centrosomin), which has unique properties to induce microtubule-nucleating sites through interacting with the gamma-tubulin complex. CNN also binds to a highly coiled-coiled protein, Cep135 important for maintaining the structural integrity of the centrosome. The first specific aim is to determine how the CNN activity to form microtubule-nucleating sites is controlled by Aurora-A. Effects of the change in CNN interaction with Aurora-A and its phosphorylation by the Aurora-A kinase will be examined. Additional CNN- and Aurora-A-interacting molecules will be searched using a combined two-hybrid screens and functional RNAi assays. The second objective is to dissect molecules involved in organization of microtubule-nucleating sites. Microtubule formation onto cytoplasmic assemblies induced by CNN overexpression will be characterized in vivo and in vitro. Proteins required for microtubule nucleation will be identified by in vitro tests of microtubule polymerization onto isolated CNN assemblies from which different molecules are stripped off and added back. Attempts will be made to polymerize microtubules onto microbeads coated with CNN and other potential molecules. The third objective is to examine assembly of mammalian centrosomes by supplementing Cep135-depleted cells with exogenous Cep135 and CNN. The process of disintegration and reformation of the functional centrosome will be monitored by fluorescence and electron microscopy. The Aurora-A gene is a tumor-susceptibility gene and its overexpression causes cancer formation. As centrosome abnormalities are implicated in the origin of chromosome instability and cancer pathogenesis, the study will be useful in establishing strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human cancers.       n/a",Assembly and Function of Mammalian Centrosomes,6929714,R01GM055735,"['RNA interference', 'cell component structure /function', 'cell cycle proteins', 'centrosome', 'confocal scanning microscopy', 'electron microscopy', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'laboratory mouse', 'laboratory rabbit', 'laboratory rat', 'microtubules', 'mitotic spindle apparatus', 'molecular assembly /self assembly', 'nuclear proteins', 'phosphorylation', 'protein localization', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'time resolved data', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES,R01,2005,222750,-0.01818652646299611

This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7012638,R01EB006200,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biotechnology', 'charge coupled device camera', 'computer program /software', 'computer system hardware', 'high throughput technology', 'image enhancement', 'robotics']",NIBIB,SANFORD-BURNHAM MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTIT,R01,2005,363523,-0.004344741744167369
"Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   To date, post-genomic analysis has focused on identification and annotation of protein-coding genes and their products. In comparison, the identification of DNA sequences encoding functional RNA has been largely neglected. Functional RNAs can encode trans-acting molecules that interact with other RNAs or proteins, such as tRNAs, rRNAs, RNaseP RNA, small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs; they can also function in cis as untranslated regions that regulate post-transcriptional expression of mRNAs. Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that there may be hundreds of unknown functional RNAs in prokaryotes and thousands in eukaryotes.      The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a computational approach to the identification of novel RNA genes and functional RNA elements in complete DNA genomes. Machine learning techniques will be used to recognize hallmarks of functional RNA coding sequences by comparison with sequences that do not encode RNAs. Several types of signals are useful in discriminating functional RNA including: 1) differences in global sequence composition, 2) calculated RNA secondary structure features, i.e. free energy of folding and 3) specific sequence elements common to RNA structure. These and other parameters can be rapidly tried and tested using machine learning methods. This method will be optimized for individual genomes with respect to input databases, parameterization and machine learning method and architecture. Results will be evaluated computationally by cross-validation testing, comparative genomics, and calculated secondary structure and free energy of folding. Experimental studies of RNA expression and function will be conducted in conjunction with collaborators.      Preliminary studies have demonstrated the power of this approach to predict novel functional RNAs in E. coli, other bacteria and archaea as supported by computational cross-validation and experimental confirmation. We will test and apply this approach to discover new functional RNAs in eukaryotic genomes including S. cervisiae, C. elegans, and humans. RNA prediction for these larger and more complex genomes will require the optimization of computational parameters, as well as the development of appropriate input datasets and training algorithms.      The prediction of novel functional RNAs in the human genome presents an opportunity to understand new regulatory and developmental processes. Known RNAs implicated in human disease, such as telomerase RNA (cancer, aging), XIST RNA (X-chromosome inactivation) and BIC (a proto-oncogene) underscore the importance of developing a method to identify the full complement of human RNA genes.         n/a",Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences,6751643,R01HG002665,"['Archaea', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Escherichia coli', 'RNA', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'animal genetic material tag', 'artificial intelligence', 'biotechnology', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'eukaryote', 'functional /structural genomics', 'genetic library', 'genetic mapping', 'human genetic material tag', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid quantitation /detection', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleic acid structure', 'prokaryote', 'technology /technique development']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2004,377162,0.041767741017860655
"Assembly and Function of Mammalian Centrosomes  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The centrosome is a major microtubule-organizing center responsible for initiation of microtubule assembly in animal cells. Microtubules are important for such processes as mitosis/meiosis, cell motility, and morphogenesis, thus centrosome dysfunction causes serious human diseases, including cancers, metastasis, and birth defects. The overall aim of this application is to understand how assembly and function of the centrosome are controlled at the molecular level. The research focuses on three centrosome proteins: Aurora-A, CNN, and Cep135. A mitosis-specific kinase, Aurora-A is involved in centrosome maturation during cell division. It binds to CNN (centrosomin), which has unique properties to induce microtubule-nucleating sites through interacting with the gamma-tubulin complex. CNN also binds to a highly coiled-coiled protein, Cep135 important for maintaining the structural integrity of the centrosome. The first specific aim is to determine how the CNN activity to form microtubule-nucleating sites is controlled by Aurora-A. Effects of the change in CNN interaction with Aurora-A and its phosphorylation by the Aurora-A kinase will be examined. Additional CNN- and Aurora-A-interacting molecules will be searched using a combined two-hybrid screens and functional RNAi assays. The second objective is to dissect molecules involved in organization of microtubule-nucleating sites. Microtubule formation onto cytoplasmic assemblies induced by CNN overexpression will be characterized in vivo and in vitro. Proteins required for microtubule nucleation will be identified by in vitro tests of microtubule polymerization onto isolated CNN assemblies from which different molecules are stripped off and added back. Attempts will be made to polymerize microtubules onto microbeads coated with CNN and other potential molecules. The third objective is to examine assembly of mammalian centrosomes by supplementing Cep135-depleted cells with exogenous Cep135 and CNN. The process of disintegration and reformation of the functional centrosome will be monitored by fluorescence and electron microscopy. The Aurora-A gene is a tumor-susceptibility gene and its overexpression causes cancer formation. As centrosome abnormalities are implicated in the origin of chromosome instability and cancer pathogenesis, the study will be useful in establishing strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human cancers.       n/a",Assembly and Function of Mammalian Centrosomes,6829771,R01GM055735,"['RNA interference', 'cell component structure /function', 'cell cycle proteins', 'centrosome', 'confocal scanning microscopy', 'electron microscopy', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'laboratory mouse', 'laboratory rabbit', 'laboratory rat', 'microtubules', 'mitotic spindle apparatus', 'molecular assembly /self assembly', 'nuclear proteins', 'phosphorylation', 'protein localization', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'time resolved data', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES,R01,2004,218770,-0.01818652646299611
"Use of Microarray Test Data for Toxicogenomic Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This project bridges the understanding between physical and chemical principles and genomic/proteomic response by integrating three independent parallel toxicity prediction tools. Each uses computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets to rapidly and accurately make pharmaceutical/chemical toxicity predictions. A CNN-based Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) module makes toxicological predictions based only on structure-activity analyses; a second CNN/wavelet module makes independent toxicogenomic predictions using microarray data; and a third CNN/wavelet module makes toxicogenomic predictions using Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) data. This multi-intelligent, three-module approach provides crosschecks to reduce false positives and false negatives while substantially increasing confidence in predictions relative to current computer-based toxicity prediction techniques. The resulting product could potentially become a primary tool used by (a) human health researchers, b) pharmaceutical companies for screening drugs early during development, c) companies designing/developing new chemicals and chemically treated materials, and (d) government organizations (e.g., military) for mission-related chemical deployments. Public benefits include reduced health and environmental risks (e.g., 4 out of 5 chemicals in use today have inadequate testing); reduced reliance on animal testing; and reduced time and cost required to bring new pharmaceuticals and chemicals into beneficial medical and commercial use.            n/a",Use of Microarray Test Data for Toxicogenomic Prediction,6743871,R41ES013321,"['computational neuroscience', 'computer data analysis', 'evaluation /testing', 'method development', 'microarray technology', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'toxicant screening', 'toxicology']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R41,2004,211770,0.010467399946893495

"Ab-Initio Geometry Optimization of Large Molecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While density-functional calculations of the energy are now feasible for biomolecules, the use of density-functional geometry optimizers is still confined to relatively small molecules containing no more than thirty atoms. The key limitation of conventional density-functional geometry optimizers is that the cost of the geometry optimization scales at least quadratically with the number of atoms in the molecule. In contrast the energy at a fixed geometry can be evaluated for a cost which scales linearly with molecule size, enabling very large molecules to be treated. This proposal is based on a radical change in the algorithm for density-functional geometry optimization, potentially reducing the total cost from quadratic to linear in molecule size and enabling a quantum leap in the size of molecules that can be optimized. The proposed algorithm resembles a conventional self-consistent calculation of the energy at a fixed geometry but at convergence the proposed algorithm yields not only the density but also the optimized geometry. This is achieved by simultaneous optimization of the wavefunction and the geometry via a modified self-consistent-field procedure. The proposed algorithm will be implemented in the QChem software package and, if successful, widely distributed through QChem Inc. and Spartan Inc.           n/a",Ab-Initio Geometry Optimization of Large Molecules,6583907,R43GM067335,"['artificial intelligence', ' chemical models', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' mathematics', ' molecular dynamics', ' molecular size', ' quantum chemistry']",NIGMS,"Q-CHEM, INC.",R43,2003,99639,0.0160228003814959

"Toxicological Evaluation Neuralnet Tools (TENT)  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  YAHSGS' Toxicological Evaluation Neuralnet Tools (TEND is designed to advance the state-of-the-art in the prediction of toxicological end points for new or untested chemicals, drugs, and compounds. TENT deploys computational neural nets (CNN), innovative computational chemistry methods, and modem statistical regression methods into interactive modules that determine (a) a chemical's 3-D structure and physical chemistry properties, (b) Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships, (C) mechanistic modes leading to toxicological responses via microassay database analysis, and (d) a broad spectrum of toxicological properties via CNN 3-D structural similarity analyses. TENTs output includes physical chemistry properties, 3-D structure, predicted toxicological impacts, and confidence level associated with each. It is anticipated that TENT will become one of the primary tools used by (a) researchers in human health and toxicological fields, (b) pharmaceutical companies to screen out drugs early in the development process prior to expending hundreds of millions on clinical in vivo and in vitro testing, (C) by companies developing new chemicals, chemical compounds, and chemically treated materials to determine potential toxicological impacts including those caused by environmental changes during and after usage, (d) companies striving to show compliance with ISO 14000 for materials used in their products, and (e) federal and military organizations for chemicals and materials contemplated for use in their mission areas. Industry experts predict that the market for TENT-type tools and applications will reach $8 -$10 billion by 2006 and three times that amount by 2016.

"Improving Quantum Chemistry Calculations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the functionality of our commercial quantum chemistry program, Q-Chem, to effectively treat molecules containing transition metals. This enhanced capability will provide Q-Chem's end-users with the ability to accurately model complex molecules such as proteins, enzymes, and catalysts of industrial importance. While remarkable progress has been made over the last several years in the accurate modeling of systems containing transition metals, current numerical methods for achieving SCF convergence in these systems are problematic at best, resulting in long execution times or, in some cases, complete failure to find a solution. However, a novel computational technique developed at Q-Chem has been shown to dramatically improve convergence for organic molecules with known SCF convergence problems. We propose to adapt this method for use with transition metals. Our goal is to achieve the same robust SCF convergence that is realized for most organic molecules, thereby greatly increasing productivity and extending the capability of scientists to study molecules such as enzymes and industrial catalysts. During Phase (I, our efforts will be to further extend Q-Chem's capability in the molecular biology arena. This proposal seeks to improve the quantum chemical treatment of molecular systems containing transition metals. Transition metal elements are essential to natural biological processes. The technology developed in this research will enable the computer modeling of those systems that are difficult to handle with the current methodologies and therefore increase of the applications of computational modeling. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Transition-metal elements play a vital role in biological systems.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY Computer algorithms based on pattern recognition are being used in many areas of science and technology to assist the scientist in solving complex, time-consuming, and often tedious real-world problems.  The basic premise is to train a computer to efficiently identify a known pattern in an unknown dataset.  This needle-in-a-haystack approach is being used in the area of genomics, where there are already several examples of very powerful computational pattern recognition approaches available for searching new sequences for structural motifs, similarities to other proteins and DNA, and predicting secondary structure, based solely on the DNA or amino acid sequence.  We believe that macromolecular crystallography can also benefit from the application of pattern recognition to the often daunting task of fitting atoms into an electron density map.  The fact that electron density maps are three-dimensional images provides an additional challenge to this technology in that the procedures we are developing in order to find matching patterns must be rotation invariant.  To test the validity of our hypothesis we will complete the following aims: 1) we will develop a set of rotation invariant features that can characterize the patterns in regions of an electron density map, 2) we will determine the optimal size of feature regions and the size and type of structural database required to find similar regions of electron density capable of accurately determining structures, and 3) we will develop a methodology to synthesize matched regions to produce coherent local and global models of protein structure. If these goals can be met, we will investigate the feasibility of incorporating knowledge-based methods, neural networks, and other AI techniques to augment the interpretation of structures from electron density maps.  In addition, we will attempt to extend this methodology to produce initial structures for electron density maps that are either of poor quality and/or low resolution.  n/a",PATTERN RECOGNITION IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY,6182183,R21GM059398,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' electron crystallography', ' electron density', ' molecular biology information system', ' physical model', ' protein structure', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R21,2000,101500,-0.04071598203452198
"MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems Project Summary Computational toxicology aims to use rules, models and algorithms based on prior data for specific endpoints, to enable the prediction of whether a new molecule will possess similar liabilities or not. Our recent efforts have used sources like PubChem and ChEMBL to build predictive models for different toxicity-related and drug discovery endpoints. Our Phase I SBIR proposal called MegaTox will provide toxicity machine learning models developed with different algorithms for 40-50 in vitro and in vivo toxicity datasets. We propose using this technology to generate machine learning models for predicting potential compounds against either TGF- a target for countering chlorine induced lung inflammation as well as the adenosine A1 receptor to identify agonists as potential anticonvulsants. In addition, we can also compile molecules that can reactivate acetylcholinesterase which would enable the potential to discover medical countermeasures to address nerve agent and pesticide poisoning. We will access multiple machine learning approaches and validate these Bayesian or other machine learning models (including Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth) with our own in-house technology for these selected targets. We will aim for ROC values greater than 0.75 and MCC and F1 scores that are acceptable (>0.3). These models will be used to virtually screen FDA approved drugs, clinical candidates, commercially available drugs or other molecules. We will select up to 50 molecules to be tested using in vitro assays alongside controls for each target. These combined efforts should in the first instance provide commercially viable treatments which will be used to experimentally validate our computational models that can be shared with the medical countermeasures scientific community. In summary, we are proposing to build and validate models for targets based on public databases, select compounds for testing, create proprietary data and use this as a starting point for further optimization of compounds if needed. Our goal is to identify at least one promising compound for each target that we then pursue and protect our IP. We will pursue additional grant funding to take these medical countermeasures through additional in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies. Ultimately, we will license our products to larger companies for development prior to clinical trials. Project Narrative There is an urgent need to develop medical countermeasures (MCM) to address pulmonary agents, nerve agents and organophosphorus pesticides. Our approach leverages public and private data to build machine learning models for different targets involved in the physiological effects of the aforementioned agents. We then use these computational models to select new molecules to test in vitro. Our approach builds on our MegaTox approach focused on modeling toxicology targets to specifically focus on identifying compounds for TGF-β and Adenosine A1 as well as potential AChE reactivators.

"MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions Project Summary The objective of ‘MegaPredict’ is to enable scientists to generate predictions for a natural product (or any molecule) and identify targets for efficacy assessment as well as identify any potential liabilities. We are building on our previous work which has compiled a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and other properties, in a form ready for model building. All of these models utilize the many sources of curated open data, including ChEMBL, ToxCast etc. We have developed a prototype of MegaPredict that utilizes Bayesian algorithm and ECFP6 fingerprints to output a list of prioritized ‘targets’. We realize that neither the algorithm or the descriptors may be optimal therefore we propose to address this as we validate MegaPredict and develop a product over this proposal. Our team is suitably qualified to develop the software needed and we will leverage our large collaborator network to assist us in validating the activity of compounds. We will initially create a script to take a natural product and score it against many thousands of machine learning models then rank the outputs to propose efficacy targets. We will use over 12,000 ChEMBL derived target-assay / bioactivity groups extracted from the ChEMBL v24 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements and other public datasets, using methodology that we have already partially developed. We can repeat this process for over 200 published compounds and access the outputs versus what is known. We intend to compare how the approach performs with synthetic drugs or drug-like compounds as well as natural products. We will assess whether other machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors can improve predictions. As we generate machine learning models such as Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth we will assess the predictions for natural products and compare with the Bayesian approach. We will compare ECFP6 with other 2D, 3D descriptors and physicochemical properties in order to identify the optimal combination for generating predictions for natural products and compare how this differs for synthetic compounds. We will validate our predictions for natural product efficacy assessment. We will work closely with multiple academic groups to generate predictions for at least 20 natural products of interest against over 20 different targets or diseases. Our goal will be to identify potential targets that were previously unknown and then generate in vitro data inhouse or with academic collaborators. Develop a prototype user interface for input of a structure, processing an input molecule and output of prioritized targets and liabilities. We have developed multiple software prototypes (e. Assay Central, MegaTox, etc.) previously and will ensure a user-friendly interface and develop new visualization methods and algorithms for prioritizing potential predicted targets based on the outputs of thousands of machine learning models. In Phase I, we will use the software internally with collaborators to rapidly prototype it. In Phase II we will develop a commercial product, and greatly expand our validation by building a larger network of academic and industry partners that would help to prioritize features of most relevance. Using the machine learning models which we have for natural products is limited because ECFP6 fingerprints cannot distinguish between these very different classes of molecules. But this provides us with an opportunity by going for a ""pharmacophore"" style approach (ideally without using 3D conformations directly). We will therefore focus on developing a ‘3D shape-based fingerprint’ or developing a novel ‘2D fingerprint’ that captures the ‘3D shape’ for natural- and druglike molecules. Currently, the public datasets in ChEMBL and PubChem etc. are made up of mostly druglike molecules, but if we have fingerprints that can compare drug-like and natural product-like molecules then we can likely reliably use our MegaPredict models for natural products as well. We can also attempt to rank natural products with our ChEMBL models or we can look through catalogs of druglike compounds using models derived from natural products. That would be an important innovation. Additionally, in Phase II it would be important to see if we could find uses for natural products with any of the 7000 rare diseases. Developing software that predicts potential natural product drug interactions with various targets could be useful to regulatory organizations as well as the pharmaceutical industry and may broaden utility of being able to more effectively mix natural product and druglike compounds in models will have a profound effect on the value of cheminformatics in this arena. Project Narrative Natural products have long been a source of therapeutics for human healthcare. Yet, some of the challenges with developing natural product treatments are identifying potential human disease related targets and avoiding others that might lead to undesirable natural product-drug interactions. Now there is considerable data in the public domain for millions of molecules with thousands of targets and ADME/T related properties that it is possible to use a suite of machine learning models for prospective prediction and profiling of a molecule’s properties from structure alone. We aim to build on our preliminary efforts to date to create a prototype for MegaPredict using various machine learning models which will enable academic and industrial scientists to generate predictions for a natural product or any molecule of interest and identify potential targets for efficacy and toxicity liability assessment.

"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) “rule learning”, which abstracts the underlying “rules” by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas. Deep learning as an emerging machine-learning method has a great potential in utilizing these data in biomedical research.

"Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics specifically and potently block the expression of disease-related genes. siRNA clinical utility is currently limited to disease targets in the liver, but the Khvorova lab has developed a novel, fully chemically modified siRNA platform that enables delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) and results in potent modulation of gene expression in mouse and monkey brain for 6 months. This technology provides an opportunity to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders, including Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Extensive chemical modification protects siRNAs from degradation and is essential for in vivo delivery, but lowers the gene silencing efficacy of many siRNA sequences. Bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict the activity of non-modified siRNAs, but these algorithms cannot predict whether a chemically modified siRNA will be functional. Identifying a hyperfunctional siRNA chemical modification pattern and developing a predictive algorithm for modified siRNA sequences will be critical for the widespread application of this platform in vivo to treat AD and other genetically-linked neurological disorders. The goal of this proposal is to identify parameters that impact the silencing efficacy of chemically modified siRNAs. Aim 1 will identify the step(s) that limit the activity of chemically modified siRNAs. Using a validated AGO2- immunoprecipitation technique and a small RNA high-throughput sequencing protocol, loading of 32 chemically modified siRNA sequences, each with 3 different chemical modification patterns, into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) will be quantified, and these results will be compared to their in vitro silencing activity. These efforts will provide a data set to determine the impacts of chemistry and sequence on the different steps of RISC function. Aim 2 will design and screen 192 siRNAs in 6 different chemical modification patterns (i.e., for a total of 1152 siRNAs) to systematically assess if and how changes to siRNA sequence and chemical modification patterns impact siRNA efficacy. These 1152 siRNAs will target 4 different mRNAs identified as therapeutic targets for AD. Completing this aim will identify siRNAs that effectively reduce the expression of AD targets. Using multiple bioinformatics analysis methods, including multi-parameter linear regression, support vector machine, and random forest, Aim 3 will model algorithms that specifically predict functional, chemically modified siRNAs. The best performing algorithm will be determined by independent and cross-validations. Completion of this project will decrease the extent of in vitro screening needed to identify functional chemically modified siRNAs capable of targeting disease genes in the CNS and streamline the design of siRNA therapies to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics are a promising class of drugs for the treatment of genetic disorders. Chemical modification of siRNA is necessary for delivery to the central nervous system, but may hinder the efficacy of some siRNAs. This project will define the relationships between siRNA sequence, chemical modification patterns, and efficacy to streamline the development of clinically-relevant siRNAs capable of treating genetically-defined neurological disorders.",Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders,9992249,F31LM013111,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hela Cells', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Huntington Disease', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA Degradation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Interference Therapy', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA-Induced Silencing Complex', 'Seeds', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic RNA', 'therapeutic target']",NLM,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2020,30514,-0.033895156054763745
"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well.

"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary The success of the ongoing battle with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) depends crucially on the availability of effective diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drugs. Although SARS-CoV-2 mutates slower than the viruses that cause the flu and the common cold, it has had more than 8300 observed single mutations on its genome of 29,900 nucleotides by June 1, 2020. We show that these mutations might have devastating effects on COVID-19 diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drugs (J. Chem. Inf. Model. In press). We will develop new artificial intelligence (AI) to forecast SARS-CoV-2 future mutations. Leveraging on state-of-art methods developed under the present R01 award, we will design mutation- resistant vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drugs.

"Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We cannot yet look at a chemical structure and predict if the molecule will have an odor, much less what character it will have. The goal of the proposed research is to apply machine learning to predict perceptual characteristics from chemical features of molecules. The specific aims of the proposal will determine (1) which molecules are odorous , and (2) what data are needed to model odor character. Building a highly predictive model requires two key ingredients: high-quality data and a sound modeling approach. High-quality data must be accurate (ratings are consistent and describe true odor properties) and detailed (ratings describe even small differences in odor properties). We have collected human psychophysical data on a diverse set of molecules and have trained a model to predict if a molecule has an odor, but pilot data identified odorous contaminants that limit model training and measurement of model accuracy. In Aim 1, I will apply my background in analytical chemistry to evaluate the accuracy of the data, using gas chromatography to identify and correct errors caused by chemical contaminants. In Aim 2, I will apply my experience in human sensory evaluation to measure and compare the consistency and the degree of detail in ratings that can be achieved with different sensory methods and subject training procedures. By executing my training plan, I will develop the skills in statistical programming and machine learning needed to employ a sound modeling approach to these problems. The model constructed in Aim 1 will enable prediction of odor classification (odor/odorless) for any molecule and thus define which molecules are perceptually relevant. Predicting odor character is a far more complex challenge – while a molecule can have only one of two odor classifications (odor or odorless) it may elicit any number of diverse odor character attributes (fruity, floral, musky, sweet, etc.). Descriptive Analysis (DA) is the gold standard method for generating accurate and detailed sensory profiles, but this method is time-consuming. We estimate that an odor character dataset will be large enough (“model-ready”) to predict odor character with approximately 10,000 molecules and that it would require more than 30,000 hours of human subject evaluation, or approximately 6 years for the typical trained panel, to produce this dataset using DA. Before we invest the time and resources, it is responsible to evaluate the relative data quality of more rapid sensory methods. The results of Aim 2 are expected to determine the best approach for generating a model-ready dataset by quantifying trade-offs in degree of detail (data resolution), rating consistency, and method speed of five candidate sensory methods. Together, these aims represent a significant step forward in linking chemical recipe to human odor perception, an advancement that supports the NIDCD goal of understanding normal olfactory function (how stimulus relates to percept) and has many potential applications in foods (what composition of molecules should be present to produce a target aroma percept). PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, scientists cannot predict whether a molecule will have an odor and, if so, what odor characteristics it will have based on its chemical structure. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models linking chemical composition to odor characteristics. These models will advance our understanding of the human olfactory system and help design strategies for improving the aroma and palatability of healthy foods.",Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure,10142097,F32DC019030,"['Address', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Food', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Food', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Palate', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Programmed Learning', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysics', 'Quality Control', 'Recipe', 'Research', 'Research Technics', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'data quality', 'design', 'experience', 'food science', 'human subject', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model building', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'skills', 'sound']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,F32,2020,67446,0.03226673757422007
"Using machine learning techniques to characterize the Metabolomics Workbench Dataset PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Mass spectrometry in combination with chromatography provides a powerful approach to characterize small molecules produced in cells, tissues and other biological systems. In essence, measured metabolites provide a functional readout of cellular state, allowing novel biological studies that advance our understanding of health and disease. Currently, the main bottleneck in metabolomics is determining the chemical identities associated with the spectral signatures of measured masses. Despite the growth of spectral databases and advances in annotation tools that recommend the chemical structure that best explains each signature, the large majority of measured masses cannot be assigned a chemical identity. There is now consensus that gleaning partial information regarding the measured spectra in terms of chemical substructure or chemical classification can inform biological studies. This consensus is reflected in the newly updated reporting standards for metabolite annotation as proposed by the Metabolite Identification Task Group of the Metabolomics Society. As we show in our Preliminary Results, spectral characterization results in “features” that can enhance performance in machine-learning tasks such as annotation.  This work aims to enhance the use and value of the metabolomics dataset in Metabolomics Workbench by: (1) developing machine-learning tools trained on this dataset to characterize unknown spectra, and (2) adding characterization information to the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. In Aim 1, we identify spectral patterns (motifs) that can represent chemically meaningful groupings of peaks within the spectra (e.g., peaks associated with aromatic substructures, loss of a substructure fragment, etc.). We utilize neural topic models that use variational inference to identify such motifs. We expect such models to offer computational speedups and to identify more chemically coherent motifs when compared to earlier implementations of topic modeling. We generate motifs across all spectra in the Metabolomics Workbench and provide annotations for each spectrum.  In Aim 2, we map spectral signatures to chemical ontology classes. As ontologies are hierarchical and as a molecule can be associated with multiple classes at different hierarchical levels of an ontology, we cast this mapping problem as a hierarchical multi-label classification problem and use neural networks to implement such a classifier. The classifier will be trained using the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. Learned motifs from Aim 1 will be used as additional input features to improve classification. We expect that the developed classifier can be used by others to elucidate measurements of unidentified molecules with chemical ontology classes, or to generate ontology terms that can be used as features in downstream machine-learning tasks. Relevance to Public Health The project proposes to investigate machine learning techniques to enhance the utility of a Common Fund data set hosted through the Metabolomics Workbench. This data set consists of biologically relevant molecules and information about their structural composition and their mass spectrometry signatures. We anticipate that our techniques will result in annotating and adding information to the data set, which in turn will advance discoveries in biomedical research and have direct benefits to human health.",Using machine learning techniques to characterize the Metabolomics Workbench Dataset,10111982,R03OD030601,"['Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatography', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Funding', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gene Expression', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histidine', 'Human', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'cost', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'neural network', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'small molecule', 'tool']",OD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R03,2020,263120,0.02388372046426257
"Learning to learn in structural biology with deep neural networks Project Summary/Abstract  Deep learning is gaining traction across many elds as a powerful tool. In medicine, there have been recent successes in drug design, predicting protein structure, and in functional genomics. These successes have thus far been in areas where there are hundreds of thousands of data points and deep learning in medicine is still limited by lack of large homongeous datasets.  This proposal focuses on applying a new kind of deep learning called meta-learning that mimics the human-like ability to learn from few examples. The PI will establish a sustainable research program on meta-learning by developing benchmark problems and datasets. The PI will further explore meta-learning speci cally on peptide-protein structure and NMR spectra prediction. Due to the imperative need for interpretability when using deep learning in medicine, a strong component will be connecting biophysical modeling with the deep learning models.  The outcome of this work will be a demonstrated new approach to deep learning that can work with little data. The PI will bring these research ideas together to design peptides that can bind to intrinsically disordred proteins, a challenging but important task for curing neurodegenerative diseases. This will be accomplished through meta-learning, molecular simulation, and iterative peptide design. Project Narrative  Deep learning is a technique from arti cial intelligence that has driven many high-pro le break- throughs in recognizing objects in images, translating human languages, and playing games like Chess and Go.

"A Machine Learning Platform for Adaptive Chemical Screening Project Summary High-throughput screening remains the most common method to identify the primary chemical hits in chemical biology and drug discovery projects. However, large-scale screens are often financially out of reach for many academic labs. The resulting small screens of small chemical libraries often identify few confirmed hits, most of which are unsuitable for medicinal chemistry follow-up. There is a critical need for computational tools that can guide experimental screening at a reasonable cost while exploring far more chemicals. This proposal will develop a computational platform that can be applied to any target or phenotypic system to select compounds for experimental screening from virtual chemical libraries with a billion or more compounds. New machine learning and high-throughput computing methods will navigate this large chemical space strategically and efficiently, improving the quality of the identified compounds. The computationally guided screening can ultimately improve the chemical diversity, target specificity, and stability of the identified active compounds, accelerating and enabling drug discovery across NIH Institutes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that make chemical screening accessible to more research groups and enable drug discovery in any therapeutic area. Data science techniques can take advantage of existing public bioactivity data in PubChem to help prioritize chemical screening for a new target. In this technology development proposal, the researchers will 1) determine a general initial screening compound set, 2) develop a computationally-guided iterative screening system, and 3) create and experimentally validate an end-to-end high-throughput computing workflow that directs drug discovery for any new target. At each step, rigorous comparisons to experimental results and baseline models will ensure the methods are working as expected and offer capabilities that do not exist in the current state-of-the-art computational methods. The resulting computational platform will improve the efficiency of and reduce the barriers to chemical screening, ultimately making screening for new compounds available to academic research groups in ways and in places where it has previously been inaccessible. Project Narrative The proposed project is broadly relevant to public health as a critical advancement of technology to enable basic biomedical research across therapeutic areas. This effort creates a computational platform to reduce the overall cost and improve the quality of high-throughput screening in any chemical biology or drug discovery project, which will be rigorously compared to existing experimental techniques.

"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards.

"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards. Two detailed case studies on the intestinal microbiota will allow us to further validate our tools. Microbiota-derived metabolites have been detected in circulation and shown to engage host cellular pathways in organs and tissues beyond the digestive system. Identifying these metabolites is thus critical for understanding the metabolic function of the microbiota and elucidating their mechanisms.

"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data.

"Image-guided robot for high-throughput microinjection of Drosophila embryos PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is submitted in response to the NIH Development of Animal Models and Related Biological Materials for Research (R21) program. The proposal develops an image-guided robotic platform that performs the automated delivery of molecular genetic tools and non-genetically encoded reagents such as chemical libraries, fluorescent dyes to monitor cellular processes, functionalized magnetic beads, or nanoparticles into thousands of Drosophila embryos in a single experimental session. The proposed work builds on recent engineering innovations in our collaborative group which has developed image-guided robotic systems that can precisely interface with single cells in intact tissue. The two Specific Aims provide for a systematic development of the proposed technologies. AIM 1 first engineers a robotic platform (‘Autoinjector’) that can scan and image Drosophila embryos in arrays of egg laying plates. We will utilize machine learning algorithms for automated detection of embryos, followed by thresholding and morphology analysis to detect embryo centroids and annotate injection sites. In AIM 2, we will utilize microprocessor-controlled fluidic circuits for programmatic delivery of femtoliter to nanoliter volumes of reagents into individual embryos. We will quantify the efficacy of the Autoinjector by comparing the survival, fertility, and transformation rates of transposon or PhiC31-mediated transgenesis to manual microinjection datasets. Finally, we will demonstrate the efficient delivery of sgRNAs and mutagenesis in the presence of Cas9. This project fits very well within the goals of the program by engineering a novel tool for producing and improving animal models. The Autoinjector will accelerate Drosophila research and empower scientists to perform novel experiments and genome-scale functional genomics screens that are currently too inefficient or labor intensive to be conducted on a large scale and may additionally enable other novel future applications.

"Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity ABSTRACT Regular exercise (physical activity) is the most effective intervention that promotes health and combats non- communicable disease (NCD). However, our understanding of the molecule(s) responsible for the superb benefits of exercise is obscure. The NIH Common Fund project “Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)” is a large-scale discovery study designed to understand the molecular responses to exercise training, which has released the first batch of multi-omics data, including RNA-seq, Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, and targeted and untargeted metabolomics, from 5 tissues collected at different time points in rats following an acute bout of endurance exercise. These endeavors have laid a solid foundation for elucidation of the molecular transducer of physical activity. We have recently made significant progress in four areas, which poised us to explore these data and elucidate the mechanism(s) in an unprecedented manner. Specifically, 1) We have obtained similar time-course, transcriptomics data in 4 tissues in mice following acute and long-term endurance exercise and developed machine learning capability for mining the multi-omics data for identification of regulatory factors that mediate the exercise benefits; 2) We have perfected CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for generation of loss- of-function knock-in mice as well as techniques to generate tissue-specific, inducible gain-of-function transgenic mice; 3) We have established comprehensive phenotypic analysis in mice; and 4) We have had a successful experience in elucidating the regulation and function of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD), a humoral factor expressed in skeletal muscle and promoted by endurance exercise, in mediating the health benefits and protection against diseases. We hypothesize that endurance exercise promotes expression and release of one or more humoral factors from one or multiple tissues/organs, which is sufficient and necessary mediating the health benefits of exercise. To this end, we propose 1) Identify candidate molecular transducers of physical activity by machine learning-based multi-omics modeling. 2) Generate loss-of-function knock-in and tissue-specific, gain-of-function transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing and transgenesis. 3) Elucidate the role of the candidate molecular transducers of physical activity in health benefits of exercise. The experimental design and model systems are both conceptually and technically innovative. The findings will significantly improve the mechanistic understanding of exercise-induced adaptations with great potential impact on the future development of therapeutics for NCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since ancient times, physical activity has been well-known to improve health and prevents disease, but the understanding of biological molecule(s) responsible for the health benefits is still obscure. We formed a multi- disciplinary team to employ computational machine learning to explore the multi-omics data obtained from MoTrPAC to identify the potential molecule(s) followed by the state-of-the-art gene editing in mice to elucidate how this molecule(s) could transduce the health benefits of physical activity.",Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity,10131449,U01AG070960,"['Acute', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fibrinogen', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Promotion', 'Health protection', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Ligands', 'Liver', 'Liver Circulation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Organ', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psyche structure', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Solid', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cognitive function', 'combat', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'endurance exercise', 'exercise capacity', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'gain of function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mental function', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'paracrine', 'phenotypic data', 'phosphoproteomics', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'skeletal', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,U01,2020,457208,-0.015784124086363798
"High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy. Because they are sensitive to the biological functional groups, detailed geometries, and chemical environments, they allow for prediction of solution phase protein structures or to identify or verify the structure of chemical compounds in the crystalline phase. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for NMR spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this equipment supplement we are proposing to acquire a dedicated compute cluster for high throughput calculations of wavefunction-based QM methods we have developed for chemical shifts that offer improved accuracy over DFT. This will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein and small molecule drug relevant for machine learning methods we have developed under NIH support. With such data, machine learning and deep networks will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting data science driven methods will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and small molecule drug prediction. NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments. This supplemental equipment proposal aims to use machine learning on QM data through the purchase of a high-throughput GPU/CPU cluster, and will significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or drug crystal, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,10145510,U01GM121667,"['Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Proteins', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'crystallinity', 'drug structure', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'success']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2020,150000,-0.04484360767356782
"Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Experimental animal and clinical testing to evaluate hepatotoxicity demands extensive resources and long turnaround times. Utilization of computational models to directly predict the toxicity of new compounds is a promising strategy to reduce the cost of drug development and to screen the multitude of industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants currently lacking safety assessments. However, the current computational models for complex toxicity endpoints, such as hepatotoxicity, are not reliable for screening new compounds and face numerous challenges. Our recent studies have shown that traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship modeling is applicable for relatively simple properties or toxicity endpoints with a clear mechanism, but fails to address complex bioactivities such as hepatotoxicity. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop novel mechanism-driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway (vAOP) models for the fast and accurate assessment of hepatotoxicity in a high-throughput manner The resulting vAOP models will be experimentally validated using a complement of in vitro and ex vivo testing. We have generated a preliminary vAOP model based on the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway that has undergone initial validation and refinement using in vitro testing. To this end, our project will generate novel predictive models for hepatotoxicity by applying 1) a virtual cellular stress pathway model to mechanism profiling and assessment of new compounds; 2) computational predictions to fill in the missing data for specific targets within the pathway; 3) in vitro experimental validation with three complementary bioassays; and 4) ex vivo experimental validation with pooled primary human hepatocytes capable of biochemical transformation. The scientific approach of this study is to develop a universal modeling workflow that can take advantage of all available short-term testing information, obtained from both computational predictions using novel machine learning approaches and in vitro experiments, for target compounds of interest. We will validate and use our modeling workflow to directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity of new compounds and prioritize candidates for validation in pooled primary human hepatocytes. The resulting workflow will be disseminated via a web portal for public users around the world with internet access. Importantly, this study will pave the way for the next generation of chemical toxicity assessment by reconstructing the modeling process through a combination of big data, computational modeling, and low cost in vitro experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the implementation of this project will lead to the first publicly available mechanisms-driven modeling and web- based prediction framework for complex chemical toxicity based on publicly-accessible big data. These deliverables will have a significant public health impact by not only prioritizing compounds for safety testing or new chemical development, but also revealing toxicity mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatotoxicity is a leading safety concern in the development of new chemicals. We will create virtual “Adverse Outcome Pathway” models that will directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity potentials of chemicals using massive public toxicity data.

"Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY The research interests of my group are rooted in explorations of new and useful conceptual models to improve the control and prediction of noncovalent interactions. Our research involves the use of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools, applications of density functional theory (DFT), cheminformatics, and machine-learning methods. A premise of our research is that aromaticity may be used to modulate many types of noncovalent interactions (such as hydrogen bonding, π-stacking, anion-π interactions). The reciprocal relationship we find, between “aromaticity” in molecules and the strengths of “noncovalent interactions,” is surprising especially since they are typically considered as largely separate ideas in chemistry. The innovation of this research is that it will enable use of intuitive “back-of-the-envelope” electron-counting rules (such as the 4n+2πe Hückel rule for aromaticity) to make predictions of experimental outcomes regarding the impact of noncovalent interactions. A five-year goal is to realize the use of our conceptual models in real synthetic examples prepared by our experimental collaborators. My research vision is to bridge discoveries of innovative concepts to their practical impacts for biomedical and biomolecular research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research proposal includes four projects that are jointly motivated by the challenge to control and predict noncovalent interactions in organic and biomolecular systems. The proposed work involves applications of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools and synergistic investigations with experimental collaborators.

"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods.

"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,9872178,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'data analysis pipeline', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,314000,-0.004703863834579617
"Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria Project Summary/Abstract Fungal and bacterial pathogens are a major threat to human health. Few therapeutics exist to treat fungal infections while bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to existing therapeutics. Humans have been using natural products to treat infections for thousands of years, long before the causal agents of infection were understood. Natural products have continued to be used as therapeutics in the modern age of medicine. Rates of rediscovery of known natural products have increased in traditional sources of natural products, such as soil bacteria. Recently, symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems have been recognized as a promising source of bioactive compounds, especially antifungal agents. These bacteria often produce natural products that defend an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use chemical biology approaches such as phenotypic interaction screens, genomics, and a new bioinformatics approach to systematically search for bioactive natural products produced by Actinobacteria symbionts and other organisms in insect agricultural systems. The first part of this proposal focuses on using existing techniques to identify new bioactive natural products. Phenotypic interaction screens can identify bioactive natural products by determining if a symbiotic bacteria produces a natural product that inhibits the growth of a fungal pathogen and vice-versa. We will then use genomic sequencing, bioinformatics, and heterologous expression to identify and characterize biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are not expressed in the phenotypic interaction screens. The second part of the proposed work involves the use of a new bioinformatics technique to identify interesting bioactive natural products. Existing bioinformatics techniques identify BGCs and predict the most likely chemical structure of the corresponding natural product. However, they do not conclude anything concerning the functional role that the natural product plays. The technique developed here will use machine learning to predict the function that the natural product fulfills in the ecological context of the organism. This algorithm will facilitate the identification of bioactive natural products with therapeutically relevant functions. Project Narrative Fungal infections are an underappreciated threat to human health with high mortality rates and few effective therapeutic agents for treatment. Symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems are a promising source of antifungal agents since they often produce natural products with antifungal activity protecting an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use phenotypic interaction screens, genome sequencing, and the development of a novel bioinformatics method to systematically mine Actinobacteria for antifungal and antibacterial products – leading to the discovery of new bioactive small molecules along with a deeper understanding of how natural products mediate the interaction between species in insect agricultural systems.",Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria,9963295,F32GM128267,"['Actinobacteria class', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Ants', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Breathing', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Insecta', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mycoses', 'Natural Products', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Soil', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'bioactive natural products', 'drug discovery', 'fungus', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'post-doctoral training', 'prediction algorithm', 'small molecule', 'symbiont']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F32,2020,65310,0.0059051090885112005
"Designing neutralization antibodies against Sars-Cov-2 Project Summary COVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic whose rapid spread and mortality rate threatens millions of lives and the global economic system. Developing effective treatment such as neutralization antibodies is an urgent need. We propose here to develop a new method to design antibodies strongly bind to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) that is necessary for viral entrance to human cells. We will develop a novel approach that combines directed evolution, deep sequencing and interpretable neural network models to efficiently identify strong and specific antibodies. This method will allow analyzing large sequencing data sets of antibody variants against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in order to derive superior binders that do not exist in the original library. Iteration through directed evolution and computational design will efficiently identify neutralization antibody candidates that can be used as potent therapeutics to treat COVID-19.

"Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling PROJECT SUMMARY The human body comprises of trillion of cells, which are the building blocks of life. Each cell is highly organized, with various constituents within localizing to specific regions. Location within a cell is a cardinal organizing principle of gene control and function, especially for RNAs that code for proteins or serve regulatory roles as non-coding RNAs. Each cell type has its distinct RNA-species profile, and where these RNAs are located within the cell can dictate their folding, editing, splicing, translation, degradation, binding partners, catalytic activity, and even the fate of the proteins that they encode. Unsurprisingly, perturbations in RNA localization result in disease conditions including cancers and neuropathologies. In spite of the vital importance of subcellular RNA localization in gene expression, investigating such phenomena simultaneously for many RNA species has been challenging. To address these long-standing issues, Dr. Furqan Fazal and others have recently developed a technique called APEX-seq that can track the location of thousands of RNAs in living human cells with high-temporal and nanometer-spatial resolution. APEX-seq has the transformative potential to provide high-resolution snapshots of tens of thousands of endogenous cellular RNA species, free from artifacts of overexpression, cell fixation or recombinant tagging. This proposal outlines a five-year career program for Dr. Fazal as he investigates principles of RNA subcellular localization, and reaches milestone goals that will transition him into an independent investigator. By improving the APEX-seq technique and amalgamating it with a number of cutting-edge tools including massively-parallel reporter assays and deep-learning-based approaches, Dr. Fazal will dissect how sequences within RNAs direct them to different locations, and how cells actively control RNA subcellular localization to regulate gene function. This work will be carried out at Stanford University, where Dr. Fazal will be mentored by Dr. Howard Chang, a pioneer in developing new genomics tools, and Dr. Joanna Wysocka, a leading authority in vertebrate development and non-coding genomic regulatory elements. Both mentors have highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions around the nation and world. Additional support will be available through collaboration with Drs. Shen, Boettiger and Kundaje who will provide training and expertise in genetics, imaging, statistics and computation. An advisory committee comprising of world-leading investigators Drs. Ting, Kool, Li, Bryant and Bassik will also monitor progress and provide expertise. Further acquisition of scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the educational resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Stanford provides an outstanding intellectually-stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success, and all proposed training will complement Dr. Fazal’s previous knowledge in genomics and biophysics and facilitate his transition into a multidisciplinary RNA biologist in the field of spatial transcriptomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many RNA species within a cell are spatially localized and locally translated into proteins, and previous studies in embryos, neurons and highly-dynamic tissues have demonstrated the vital importance of RNA subcellular location in development and cellular function. However, it has been challenging to study localization transcriptome-wide, which has hampered understanding of the extent and role of such processes in normal and diseased tissues. The proposed work will improve a newly-developed tool for the RNA community to investigate spatial transcriptomics, and use it to provide new insights into RNA biology by determining the regulatory sequences (i.e. the grammar) controlling localization, as well as identifying the associated cellular mechanisms.",Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling,10016780,K99HG010910,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Biological Transport', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterochromatin', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Motors', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Envelope', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Nuclear Pore', 'Organelles', 'Outer Mitochondrial Membrane', 'Pattern', 'Peroxidases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Transport', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'active control', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'cell fixation', 'cell type', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education resources', 'experience', 'gene function', 'genomic tools', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanometer', 'neuropathology', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'ribosome profiling', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,81284,0.008789320098158629
"Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo. ABSTRACT: “Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo”  microRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small regulatory RNAs involved in repression of gene expression. They recognize their target mRNAs though base pairing and upon binding, trigger translational repression, deadenylation and decay of the target mRNAs. Given that each miRNA has the potential to regulate hundreds of genes, and several dozens of miRNAs are expressed in each cell type, miRNAs are one of the master regulators of gene expression at post-transcriptional level in animals, plants and virus. Thus, the elucidation of the miRNA complement is essential to understand gene regulation and mRNA turnover. The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method for miRNA discovery and experimental validation in vivo.  Current miRNA discovery methods heavily rely on providing sequencing evidence of a small RNA that fits into a hairpin-like structure predicted bioinformatically. The problem is that sample availability or the abundance of a specific cell type in a tissue may be limited and hamper the number of miRNAs that can be backed-up with sequencing support. In these situations, the current solution is to sequence deeper, increasing overall costs. On the other hand, the presence of a small RNA of ~22-nt does not guarantee the belonging to the miRNA family, as random degradation of cellular RNAs also will produce small RNAs of this size and only tedious experimental validation of their processing into intermediate species and mature miRNA can confirm their identity.  A recent curation work found that of the over ~7,000 metazoan miRNAs in miRBase, the reference miRNA database, only 1,175 fulfilled the features necessary to pass as miRNAs, directly rejected 3,470 as false positives and lacked enough sequencing evidence to call another 2,105 miRNAs. Therefore, there is an unmet technological need to develop a miRNA validation method that boosts the access to the miRNA candidates even from limited samples and that allows rigorous multiplexed experimental validation of their processing.  With the synergy of an interdisciplinary team that combines expertise in microRNAs and zebrafish manipulation (Dr. Cifuentes, PI) and bioinformatics (Dr. Moxon, co-I), we will develop miRAGe (miRNA Analysis Genome wide), a high-throughput method to integrate miRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. The fundamental concept behind miRAGe is the use of living cells as “organic computers” to analyze miRNA processing. We will use massively parallel oligo pool synthesis to prepare the miRNA candidate precursors and test their processing in injected zebrafish embryos. Small RNA sequencing will determine which candidates are true microRNA by detecting their ~22-nucleotide mature product and their stereotypic intermediates.  Overall, the results from this project will transform the access of the scientific community to high quality, experimentally validated miRNA data from any organism with genomic data available, thus enhancing future transversal studies on post-transcriptional regulation. NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method to integrate microRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. We will take advantage of oligo pool synthesis to prepare the microRNA candidate precursors and test their processing after injection in zebrafish embryos.

"Determination of structure, dynamics and energetics of enzyme reactions Project Summary  Understanding enzyme mechanisms is of paramount importance from both the basic biophysics perspective of understanding life processes and the role of enzymes in diseases. To achieve a detailed understanding of enzyme catalysis, the effects of protein structure and dynamics on the reaction energetics need to be elucidated. We propose a combined computational and experimental approach that combines the synthetic, computational and structural biology expertise of a team of investigators that has been working together for >15 years to create a “molecular movie” where the position, movement and energy of every atom in the system followed over the entire reaction pathway. The proposal exploits the emerging convergence of timescales accessible by molecular simulation using GPUs and time resolved structural biology. Specific Aim 1 describes the simulation of the complete reaction pathway of Pseudomonas mevalonii (Pm) HMGCoA Reductase (HMGR) and will use transition state force fields (TSFFs) generated by the quantum guided molecular mechanics method to allow the µsec MD simulations of the chemical steps. TSFFs not only circumvent the well-known boundary problem of QM/MM, but are also 102-104 times faster. This allows a realistic modeling of the coupling of µsec dynamics and catalysis that was demonstrated in the last grant period to be essential for understanding the reaction. Together with accelerated MD simulations of the conformational changes involved in the reaction using standard force fields, these computational studies cover the fsec to µsec timescale. In Specific Aim 2, the computational results will be merged with the results of a three-tiered approach to obtain structural snapshots with progressively increasing time resolution: (i) “Frozen” intermediates that map out the overall pathway on long timescales, (ii) time resolved Laue crystallography using pH jump initiation on the msec timescale and (iii) use of photocaged substrates to allow time resolved Laue experiments on the µsec timescale. This approach will be applied to the study of HMGR, an enzyme of high biophysical and biomedical significance that has a complex reaction mechanism involving three chemical steps, six large-scale conformational changes and two cofactor exchange steps. The project is highly innovative because it (i) uses a combination of MD simulations using TSFFs and time resolved crystallography to span timescales of at least 12 orders of magnitude, (ii) iteratively couples the Markov State analysis of long timescale trajectories to the Singular Value Decomposition used to analyze time resolved crystallography data, thus providing new tools to generate and experimentally validate trial structures (iii) applies global optimization and machine learning techniques to allow the automated fitting of TSFFs for proteins, which will enhance the application of this powerful method to other proteins and (iv) provides new photocaged substrates for the study of enzyme mechanisms to the chemical biology community. All tool compounds, methods and codes developed in this project will be made available to the scientific community. Public Health Statement  The detailed study of enzyme mechanisms is a cornerstone of biophysical chemistry that, while basic in nature, has had a major impact on human health including the development of new mechanism-based drugs for a range of diseases and an understanding of the mechanism of action for existing drugs that allows the design of combination therapies. The combination of Laue crystallography and long-scale MD simulations will allow simultaneous studies of structure, dynamics and energetic studies with unprecedented detail. The application to HMG CoA Reductase, arguably the single most important drug target in western industrialized countries, will demonstrate the applicability of the methodology to an enzyme of high mechanistic complexity. 1","Determination of structure, dynamics and energetics of enzyme reactions",9897100,R01GM111645,"['Active Sites', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Couples', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enzymatic Biochemistry', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Free Energy', 'Freezing', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Movement', 'Mutagenesis', 'Nature', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Pseudomonas', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical chemistry', 'cofactor', 'computer studies', 'design', 'electron density', 'enzyme mechanism', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'millisecond', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'molecular scale', 'movie', 'new therapeutic target', 'particle', 'protein structure', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'structural biology', 'synthetic biology', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2020,335664,-0.012098562712970655
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data.

"Imaging Molecular Level Details of Collagen Fibers by VSFG Microscopy In this proposed project, we plan to fill the knowledge gap of the relationships between microscopic self-assembled structures, collagen-molecule interactions and macroscopic fiber morphologies of type-I collagen, the primary component of most human tissues and a commonly used biomaterial for tissue engineering. By investigating collagen-water and collagen-protein interactions in in vitro systems that mimic basic aspects of physiologically relevant three- dimensional fibrillar tissue architectures, we aim to fill knowledge gaps in fundamental collagen research. We will achieve this goal by developing a hyperspectral imaging technique – vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) microscopy – at high repetition rates (400 kHz) and apply it to collagen. The long-term vision is to develop new biophysics methods to reveal molecular-level structures and interactions for pericellular space research and other complex biological environments, and eventually applying it to study various pericellular environment related diseases. In order to correlate spectral features to microscopic and macroscopic structures of type I collagen, we plan to apply machine-learning techniques to analyze our data and extract spectral signatures of collagen’s micro/macrostructures. We will two major scientific focuses: (A) understanding molecular signatures of microscopic self-assembly fibrils structures and its relationship to the macroscopic morphology (plan 1 and 2); and (B) investigating molecular level collagen-molecule interactions (plan 3 and 4). Specific plans include:  1. Obtaining hyperspectral VSFG images of collagen tissues to study their morphology in a  label free and non-invasive manner  2. Establishing molecular spectral signatures of self-assembled collagen fibril structures  3. Understanding collagen-water interaction in first solvation layer of collagen fibers.  4. Imaging spatial locations of chemicals and peptides that interact with collagens. If successful, the significance is that a label free, vibrational mode specific imaging technique specific for pericellular space will be available, which can reveal molecular level insights of collagen structures and its interactions with surrounding molecules, pertinent to fibrosis and cell— pericellular space interaction related diseases. This proposed project contributes to the scope of NIGMS by developing new technology to reveal fundamental molecular-level principle, mechanism and signatures related to morphology of collagen I at both micro- and macroscopic scales, and collagen-molecule interactions, laying foundations for biophysical/biochemical principles for future biomedical applications related to collagens.

"Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space Project Summary  The natural environment is intrinsically spatiotemporally heterogenous at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. What shapes such a heterogeneity includes the concentration gradients of biologically relevant chemical species in the extracellular medium including dioxygen (O2), reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as essential redox-active transition metals. While a significant amount of effort has been devoted to spectroscopically image these chemical moieties, our capability to spatiotemporally control their concentration distributions in the extracellular medium remains limited. This is especially the case for biofilms and microbiota, in which the microorganisms’ small length scales pose significant challenges for concentration modulation. The inadequate control of concentration heterogeneity limits our capability of mimicking the natural environments in vitro and investigating how local concentration gradients affect microbial functionality. Therefore, there is a need for an advanced method of controlling chemical concentrations at microscopic level.  Our proposed research aims to use electrochemical nano-/micro-electrodes to spatiotemporally control the concentration gradients in the extracellular medium. When an electrochemical reaction occurs on an electrode’s surface, a concentration gradient is established near the electrode. Taking advantages of this phenomena with the assistance of numerical simulation, we will employ an array of nano-/micro-electrodes with individually addressable electrochemical potentials to program any arbitrary spatiotemporal concentration profiles. We will fine-tune the surface chemistry and the electrochemical properties of these electrodes to ensure biocompatibility and reaction specificity. The developed system will be applied to biofilms and we aim to investigate how the microbial social behavior will be affected by a perturbation of local O2 concentration. Moreover, we will use this device to mimic the heterogenous environment in the gut and culture gut microbiota in vitro. An algorithm based on machine learning will be employed to actively adjust electrode potentials, maintaining a stable concentration profile despite the accumulation of gut microorganisms.  Ultimately, our work will expand our capability of controlling the concentration heterogeneity in nature. The developed electrochemical system will serve an in vitro platform to culture microorganisms in their native environment, or as a tool to perturb the concentration profiles. Combining electrochemistry, inorganic chemistry, and nanomaterials the research will enable a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution and temporal response of microbial systems. Project Narrative The natural environment is intrinsically heterogenous yet our control of concentrations for chemical species is limited at microscopic level. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NIH because it describes the development of technology that will expand our capability of controlling chemical concentration profiles in a variety of microbial systems relevant to the public health.

"Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We have recently developed novel framework for next-generation quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) designed to meet the challenges of biomolecular simulations and drug discovery applications. QMFFs have tremendous computational advantages relative to their fully QM counterparts, being inherently parallelizable and linearly scaling, offering tremendous computational speedup, and promising quantitative accuracy potentially superior to full QM methods. QMFFs accurately model multipolar electrostatics, charge penetration effects, and non-linear polarization response. QMFFs thus offer a transformative technology for drug discovery applications, in particular, for advancing the predictive capability of free energy simulations in lead reﬁnement. These are critically important for the diverse chemical space of drug molecules, including halogen bonding, cation-  and metal-ligand interactions. Further, QMFFs offer a mechanism for modeling covalent inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, we propose to: I. Develop new QMFFs for drug discovery. QMFFs will be developed based on both semiempirical and ab initio density-functional methods in the following stages: 1) determination of multipolar mapping parameters enhancing the DFTB electrostatic potential to reach greater accuracy, 2) augmentation of electronic response terms using chemical potential equalization (CPE) corrections using an orthogonal perturbation-response approach to solve the under-polarization problem of DFTB methods, 3) parameterization of non-electrostatic non-bonded interac- tion parameters using realistic potentials that capture many-body exchange and dispersion interactions, and 4) exploration of statistical potentials, using machine learning approaches applied to quantum data sets, to correct internal conformational energies and short-range interactions. II. Develop new free energy methods to enable protein-ligand binding predictions using QMFFs. We will develop a novel integrated free energy pipeline to pre- dict alchemical binding free energies for ligands and inhibitors. This will include new GPU-accelerated methods for  -space self-adaptive mixture sampling ( -SAMS) and 2D-vFEP analysis, coupled with conformational space enhanced sampling methods for alchemical steps of the thermodynamic cycle, and advancements in free en- ergy “book-ending” methods (BBQm) to efﬁciently connect molecular mechanical force ﬁeld and QMFF model representations. III. Test and validate QMFFs and free energy methods, and apply to MIF inhibitor binding. The methods will be broadly tested against established data sets for solvation free energies, and a drug discovery data set. More in-depth validation studies will be conducted by examining the relative binding free energies of inhibitors of the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). Finally, exploratory applications will examine mechanisms, characterize transition states and predict rates for covalent inhibition for a series of MIF inhibitors. Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Laboratory for Biomolecular Simulation Research, Rutgers University, Piscat- away, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We propose a novel strategy to develop a class of integrated quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) that create highly accurate physical models for complex biomolecular simulations. Com- bined with recently developed high-precision free energy simulation and analysis tools, the pro- posed QMFFs will overcome current critical barriers to progress for drug discovery and deliver accurate and precise predictions for drug binding afﬁnity to enhance lead optimization. The pro- posed work will be applied to understand ligand-protein binding in the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF), and provide insight that may guide the design of new non-covalent and targeted covalent inhibitors to MIF and other systems.",Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications,10005389,R01GM107485,"['Affinity', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Books', 'Cations', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Free Energy', 'Halogens', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Penetration', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lead optimization', 'macrophage', 'mechanical force', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'programs', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2020,320588,-0.04464683217575926
"New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures RNA molecules play fundamental roles in nearly all cellular processes at the level of gene expression and regulation. Not surprisingly, emerging biomedical advances such as precision medicine and synthetic biology all point to RNA as the central regulators and information carriers. Recently, realizing the potential of using RNA to intervene gene expression, scientists successfully developed Onpattro, the ﬁrst FDA-approved RNA-based therapy in August 2018.  Understanding RNA function and therapeutic applications requires knowledge about RNA structure. Unfortu- nately, currently, the number of the known structures is a small fraction of what need to be determined. This gap has to be closed by computational methods. Furthermore, an RNA molecule is a highly charged polyanion and positive charges such as metal ions bind to an RNA and for an integral part of an RNA structure. Where and how metal ions interact with an RNA can directly impact RNA structure and function as well as RNA-drug interactions.  Continuously supported by NIH for over 15 years, we have developed systematic computational tools for the predictions of RNA structures, folding stability, kinetics, and metal ion effects. These tools have led to fruitful applications in virology, microbiology, gene therapy, RNA biotechnology, and various RNA-based therapeutic de- signs. However, despite over decade of efforts, many critical issues in computational RNA biology still remain: de novo prediction of non-Watson-Crick interactions, structure prediction for large RNAs, effective incorporation of experimental data such as cryo-EM and NMR data into structure prediction, and modeling of metal ion ef- fects. In this grant, after 15 years of developing an initio physics-based models, we propose to target the above and other pressing issues using a fundamentally different approach by systematically developing data-driven (such as deep-learning) or hybrid data-driven/physics-based simulation methods. The new approaches are mo- tivated by the increasing amount of experimental data and the pressing need to have more efﬁcient and reliable computational tools for data interpretation, especially for structure determination experiments. We will use ex- perimental database, such as RNA-Puzzles database, PDB, EMDataBank, BMRB, for large-scale benchmark tests, and biochemical and NMR data collected by our well-established collaborators for in-depth and interactive information about various experiments such as HCV genomic RNAs and HIV PBS systems. Our goal, if success- fully accomplished, will immediately impact experiments such as structure determination, including cryo-EM and NMR-based structure determination, identiﬁcation of metal ion sites, and rational design of RNA structures for therapeutic applications. RNA structures and interactions hold the key to many important biological processes. This project develops cutting-edge computational methods for the predictions of RNA structures and interactions. The results from the project will lead to novel computational tools for understanding disease mechanism at molecular level and for the rational design of RNA-based therapeutics. !",New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures,9851572,R35GM134919,"['Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell physiology', 'Charge', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'FDA approved', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hybrids', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Physics', 'Play', 'RNA', 'RNA Computations', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene therapy', 'genomic RNA', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'polyanion', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'success', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2020,240392,0.062266839880834625
"Open Data-driven Infrastructure for Building Biomolecular Force Field for Predictive Biophysics and Drug Design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Molecular simulation is a powerful tool to predict the properties of biomolecules, interpret biophysical experiments, and design small molecules or biomolecules with therapeutic utility. However, a number of obstacles have impeded the development of quantitative, cloud-scale research workﬂows involving biomolecular simulation. Two main ob- stacles are the insufﬁcient accuracy of current atomistic models for biomolecules and small molecule therapeutics and the lack of interoperability in simulation toolchains used in both academic and industrial biomolecular research. Our original R01, “Open Data-driven Infrastructure for Building Biomolecular Force Fields for Predictive Bio- physics and Drug Design,” seeks to solve the ﬁrst problem. It helps fund our effort, the Open Force Field Initiative (https://openforceﬁeld.org) to develop open, extensible, and shared software and data infrastructure, implementing statistically robust methods of parameterizing force ﬁelds and choosing new force ﬁelds in a statistically sound manner. This work is designed to create not just a new generation of force ﬁelds, but an open technology to continue advancing force ﬁeld science. However, even with improved molecular models, putting together complete workﬂows of biomolecular simulations involves interfacing substantial numbers of different tools. However the majority of the existing molecular simulation workﬂows are mutually incompatible, with differing representations of the molecular models. The Open Force Field Initiative effort already includes the development of molecular data structures that we can ex- port into existing molecular simulation tools. We propose to extend the existing scope of our R01 to create an extensible common molecular simulation representation and translators to and from this representation. Such a set of tools will immediately make it signiﬁcantly easier to combine the disparate workﬂows developed for different sets of molecular simulation tools. Researchers will be able to set up and build the biophysical simulations using their usual tools, but run and analyze them with currently incompatible tools, enabling better matching of computational resources and methods to problems. It will help avoid trapping in a single software framework, and enable combinations of functionalities previously impossible without substantial developer time and effort. We will (Aim 1) work with partners to generalize our modular, extensible object model for representing parameterized biomolecular systems in a manner that accommodates the force ﬁeld terms currently supported by most popular biomolecular simulation packages. We will engineer it to be extensible to advanced interaction forms, such as polarizability and other multibody terms, and machine learning models for intermolecular forces. We will (Aim 2): enable easy conversion between components of molecular simulation workﬂows by allowing other molecular simulation packages to easily store their representations in this data model, developing converters that can import/export this object model to multiple popular ﬁle formats, focusing initially on OpenMM, AMBER, CHARMM, and GROMACS. We will demonstrate the utility of this interface in cloud-ready workﬂows. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scientists use computer simulations of proteins, DNA, and RNA, at atomic detail, to learn how these molecules of life carry out their functions and to design new medications. We aim to greatly increase the utility of all of these simulations by improving the accuracy of the formulas they use to compute the forces acting between atoms. This supplement will make it much easier for molecular simulation workﬂows to interoperate with each other in large-scale workﬂows.",Open Data-driven Infrastructure for Building Biomolecular Force Field for Predictive Biophysics and Drug Design,10166314,R01GM132386,"['Affinity', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'COVID-19', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Infrastructure', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'RNA', 'Readability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Framework', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'biomaterial interface', 'computing resources', 'data infrastructure', 'data modeling', 'design', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'molecular modeling', 'open data', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'small molecule therapeutics', 'software infrastructure', 'sound', 'structured data', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2020,225000,0.01718095005332657
"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology.

To address this issue, we propose to develop a genetically encodable Cas-based RNA proximity-labeling strategy to precisely identify proteins that bind in close proximity to a specific RNA sequence. We will then use this approach to identify protein factors involved in regulating microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8) activity at specific primary micro-RNA loci.

Our approaches will help us define the gRNA design rules for RNA-targeting Cas proteins, and develop robust new RNA-targeting Cas tools to manipulate RNA splicing and dissect protein- RNA interaction networks, and ultimately, the tools developed here will transform the way we study RNA and will broadly impact the fields of molecular and cell biology.",Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology,9984455,R35GM133462,"['Address', 'Alternative Splicing', 'BCAR1 gene', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Floods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microprocessor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Transcript', 'base', 'clinical application', 'design', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'single cell analysis', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R35,2020,385000,0.06624967078982516
"Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention Project Summary/Abstract Viruses are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) being one of the most infectious and prevalent among them. Roughly 250 million people worldwide suffer from chronic HBV infection, including 1-2 million in the United States. Of those infected, approximately 15-25% will develop se- rious liver problems, including cirrhosis, cancer, and ultimately failure, leading to 600,000 deaths annually. While therapies exist to manage chronic HBV infection, all target viral genomic processes such as reverse transcription and DNA replication, and none provide a cure due to viral persistence and resistance. A promising orthogonal approach to eliminating infection is to target HBV's capsid, the protein shell that encapsulates the viral genome. The Finn laboratory has previously developed compounds that induce the misdirected assembly of non-functional HBV capsids, showing that small molecules have the power to affect the structures of these large multi-protein assemblies. While much is known about the structures of the intermolecular interactions with these compounds identiﬁed after the fact, little about the dynamics of such interactions has been explored, and a predictive under- standing of functional (antiviral) binding has yet to be developed. Both deﬁciencies will begin to be addressed in this program. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with in vitro experiments on HepAD38 cells, the PIs have identiﬁed seven compounds based on motifs previously unknown to interact with HBV that target the capsid assembly process. These compounds bind in a known pocket at the interface of two capsid-protein (Cp) dimers, possess moderate antiviral activity, and low toxicity. In the ﬁrst aim, using docking, free-energy perturba- tion, and synthetic chemistry, the PIs will optimize the lead compound to improve its efﬁcacy against HBV. In the second aim, using molecular dynamics simulations, advanced free-energy calculations, and experimental assays on different HBV protein oligomers, up to and including the whole virus capsid, the PIs will determine how small molecules interfere with capsid assembly. Both aims will beneﬁt from using a machine-learning-based classiﬁ- cation scheme as well as novel enhanced sampling methods. The lessons learned here concerning how small molecules can re-direct the assembly pathway into unproductive conformations can be generalized for application to other viruses. Project Narrative In spite of the dramatic increase in our understanding of the structure and properties of hepatitis B virus (HBV), this pathogen remains a major threat to human health. That knowledge also makes HBV an important test case for new antiviral strategies. This project aims to limit the impact of HBV by using computer simulations and synthetic chemistry to develop an improved understanding of the assembly process of HBV as well as new drugs that can eliminate HBV infection in ways that may be generalized to other pathogenic viruses.",Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention,10051923,R01AI148740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Capsid', 'Capsid Proteins', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Hepatitis B', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Encapsulated', 'Equilibrium', 'Failure', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Structure', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'dimer', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'intermolecular interaction', 'lead optimization', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'programs', 'protein oligomer', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'success', 'viral genomics']",NIAID,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,407510,-0.04777681256978716
"Computer Simulations of Enzymes Computer simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) and the combined quantum  mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach are capable of describing structures and dynamics  of proteins and chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. An accurate and  computationally efficient energy function is necessary. However, challenges remain: the  accuracy of QM method, the compatibility between the electron density of the QM subsystem and  classical force fields for the MM subsystem, and the cost of ab initio QM/MM methods capitalizing  on the accuracy and reliability of the associated QM approaches. To address these challenges, we  have developed a series of ab initio QM/MM approaches on reaction path optimizations and free  energy calculations, the QM/MM minimum free-energy path (QM/MM-MFEP) and the QM/MM neural  network (QM/MM-NN) methods. This proposal aims to develop further the ab initio QM/MM methodology  and its applications to the studies of redox processes in important enzymes, and the construction  of ab initio force fields combined with neural network representations. Our long-term goals are to develop and establish accurate first-principles based and density  functional theory (DFT) based MD and QM/MM simulation as an equal partner with experiments for the  study of enzymes and proteins and to provide insight into chemical and redox processes in  biological systems. Our aims are as follows: (1) We aim to make ab initio QM/MM models for much  more accurate QM/MM energies, for the QM description and for the electrostatic and vdW interactions   between the QM and MM subsystems. (2) We aim to develop a combined computational  model to explore the key molecular determinants of the reduction potential variability in  metalloproteins. We will provide detailed insight into chemical and redox reaction mechanisms in  biological systems, in particular laccases. (3) We aim at the development of accurate  force fields of water, and proteins for simulations in biological applications, going beyond the  traditional force field forms and limitation in accuracy. The proposed developments will capitalize on the theoretical developments in quantum  electronic theory, such as the linear response theory and accurate many-electron approach for  non-covalent interactions, and leverage machine-learning methods in data science for biological  system simulations. The proposed work will lead to the major advancement of the ab initio QM/MM  method and force fields, and insights into the structure-function paradigm for proteins  and important redox process and reaction mechanisms in enzymes. In addition, it will also lead to  methodology development for design of new drugs and enzyme inhibitors. Understanding chemical reactions and redox processes in solution and in enzymes is of critical  importance, because the structure-function relationship and the catalytic role of enzymes  are fundamental insights in biochemical research, and they are essential for the development of  new or better inhibitors and enzymes. Quantitative tools such as simulations make key contributions  to the investigation of the structure-function relationship, complementing experimental studies.  This proposal aims at developing methods for simulating structures and dynamics in proteins, and  chemical and redox processes catalyzed by enzymes, and investigating the mechanisms of  important enzymes-copper protein laccases, leading to significant advances in research tools for  studying enzymes and contributing to the understanding of life processes, as well as aiding in the  design of inhibitors and drugs.",Computer Simulations of Enzymes,10001530,R01GM061870,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Biophysical Process', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copper', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Electrons', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Laccase', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Mechanics', 'Metalloproteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Potential Energy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical reaction', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'electron density', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'intermolecular interaction', 'machine learning method', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'neural network', 'novel therapeutics', 'perturbation theory', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,360797,-0.012983730691187466
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,9934213,R01GM053148,"['ATP Synthesis Pathway', 'Achievement', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amino Acids', 'Anions', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Entropy', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Inorganic Phosphate Transporter', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proton Pump', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Water', 'Wisconsin', 'anti-influenza drug', 'antiporter', 'chemical bond', 'chemical reaction', 'experimental study', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'kinetic model', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'multi drug transporter', 'novel', 'pH gradient', 'protonation', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'symporter', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,310328,-0.005574085356217669
"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9982190,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'kinetic model', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2020,1239304,0.000885478368607483
"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The study of biomolecular interactions and design of new therapeutics requires accurate physical models of the atomistic interactions between small molecules and biological macromolecules. Over the least few decades, molecular mechanics force ﬁelds have demonstrated the potential that physical models hold for quantitative biophysical modeling and predictive molecular design. However, a signiﬁcant technology gap exists in our ability to build force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy, can be systematically improved in a statistically robust manner, be extended to new areas of chemistry, can model post-translational and covalent modiﬁcations, are able to quantify systematic errors in predictions, and can be broadly applied across a high-performance software packages. In this project, we willl bridge this technology gap to enable new generations of accurate quantitative biomolec- ular modeling and (bio)molecular design for chemical biology and drug discovery. In Aim 1, we will produce a modern, open infrastructure to enable practitioners to rapidly and conveniently construct and employ accurate and statistically robust physical force ﬁelds via automated machine learning methods. In Aim 2, we will construct open, machine-readable experimental and quantum chemical datasets that will accelerate next-generation force ﬁeld development. In Aim 3, we will develop statistically robust Bayesian inference techniques to enable the auto- mated construction of type assignment schemes that avoid overﬁtting and selection of physical functional forms statistically justﬁed by the data. This approach will also provide an estimate of the systematic error in predicted properties arising from uncertainty in parameters or functional form choices—generally the dominant source of error—to be quantiﬁed with little added expense. In Aim 4, we will integrate and apply this infrastructure to produce open, transferable, self-consistent force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy and broad coverage for modeling small molecule interactions with biomolecules (including unnatural amino or nucleic acids and covalent modiﬁcations by organic molecules), with the ultimate goal of covering all major biomolecules. This research is signiﬁcant in that the technology developed in this project has the potential to radically transform the study of biomolecular phenomena by providing highly accurate force ﬁelds with exceptionally broad chemical coverage via fully consistent parameterization of organic (bio)molecules. In addition, we will produce new tools to automate force ﬁeld creation and tailoring to speciﬁc problem domains, quantify the systematic error in predictions, and identify new data for improving force ﬁeld accuracy. This will greatly improve our ability to study diverse biophysical processes at the molecular level, and to rationally design new small-molecule, protein, and nucleic acid therapeutics.

"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets.

"Computational Methods to Characterize Alternative Splicing from Massive Collections of RNA-seq Data SUMMARY Alternative splicing (AS) is a gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human biology and disease. High throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) is making it possible to survey the expressed genes and their alternative splicing variations in a wide variety of cellular conditions. However, the short reads are challenging to analyze, demanding highly sophisticated computational methods that can extract meaningful AS information efficiently, accurately, and in a comprehensive way. While there has been great progress so far, current methods based on assembling the short reads into transcript annotations have reached a plateau. We propose two innovations that can help overcome the limits. The first is one-step simultaneous analyses of multiple samples in an RNA-seq collection, in contrast with the current two-step approach that analyzes each sample separately and then merges the results. The second is to create and interrogate assembly-free representations of AS. The project will design a suite of tools that will leverage the latent information in large collections of samples and from heterogeneous data types to build complete and accurate AS signatures of tissues and cell types, and to elucidate the regulatory circuitry of AS and its functional implications. Aim 1 will develop a high- performance multi-sample transcript assembly tool, combining subexon graph representations of genes and AS variations, statistical methods for improved feature detection, and search space reduction techniques for efficient sample processing. Aim 2 will build highly efficient and accurate feature selection tools to detect and characterize assembly-free AS variations (subexons and introns), simultaneously from collections of RNA-seq samples. It will combine novel regularized programs with complex models of intronic `noise' and other RNA-seq confounders, and enable analyses of differential splicing and to identify individual and group-specific variations. Lastly, Aim 3 will develop a system to comprehensively model the regulatory and functional circuitry of AS and the effects of mutations, starting from deep learning models of sequences and alignments and integrating expression, sequence, epigenetic and mutation data across tissues, cell types and conditions. We will rigorously test and evaluate all tools in simulations and on large public data sets, as well as on thyroid and head and neck cancer data provided by our collaborators, and we will experimentally validate random subsets of predictions with capillary electrophoresis and qRT-PCR. Collectively, the concepts, methods and tools will establish a new framework for analyzing RNA-seq data that can efficiently tackle the `big data' challenges, leading to more complete discovery and annotation of AS structure and function in human health and disease.   NARRATIVE Alternative splicing is a fundamental gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human physiology and disease. Next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is making it possible to characterize alternative splicing in great detail, however, current bioinformatics analysis tools miss important variations. The project will design a suite of innovative tools that criss-cross information across multiple RNA-seq samples, and across heterogeneous sequence, epigenetic and expression data, to more comprehensively and more accurately determine the structure, function and regulation of alternative splicing in human biology and disease.",Computational Methods to Characterize Alternative Splicing from Massive Collections of RNA-seq Data,10021689,R01GM129085,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Bypass', 'Capillary Electrophoresis', 'Charge', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Farming environment', 'Follicular thyroid carcinoma', 'Galaxy', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Graph', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'International', 'Introns', 'Learning Module', 'Length', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spliced Genes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Thyroid carcinoma', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'data reduction', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feature detection', 'feature selection', 'heterogenous data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'prototype', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'simulation', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,363164,0.009143251876179571
"ADAR-editing landscape dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders Project Abstract:  Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) editing plays a major role in shaping transcriptome diversity by creating variant isoforms that enable fine-tuning of calcium-mediated excitatory and other signaling needed for brain development, neural plasticity and mood regulation. The spatio-temporal ADAR editing landscapes are tightly regulated by controlling ADAR expression levels to preserve preferential binding and editing. Previous studies have shown that activation of the interferon pathways of the innate immune system – such as those seen in viral infections - leads to increased expression of ADAR1p150, which ultimately results in changes to ADAR editing patterns. Furthermore, common side effects to innate immune activation by interferon alpha therapies include increased risk of depression and suicide. The changes in spatio-temporal regulation of editing patterns can lead to a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms, including neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., decreased ADAR editing in the serotonin receptor subunit2C in the prefrontal cortex observed in individuals who commit suicide). Yet, our understanding of ADAR editing landscapes remain cursory. Advances in high throughput RNA-seq enable more accurate variant calling from the sequencing reads, providing a way to map ADAR editing patterns in the transcriptome. However, there are no computational pipelines focused on ADAR editing that are easy to use, are reproducible and can handle large scale analysis. I have recently built a pipeline to handle meta-analysis of RNA-seq data that incorporates variant calling steps, but further work is needed to validate this tool to assure accuracy and reproducibility of results. It can then be used to map the spatio-temporal variation of ADAR editing landscapes. The proposed project will study ADAR editing landscapes in the following ways: (i) new computational pipelines will be benchmarked to use variant calling with RNA-seq datasets using simulated reads, (ii) ADAR editing landscape diversity in the publicly available human samples will be mapped; the computational predictions and hypotheses generated from the pipeline will be validated using (iii) measuring calcium flux in cells with known differential ADAR editing landscapes caused by PolyI:C (viral infection mimic) treatment. The proposed work will yield a validated pipeline capable of mapping ADAR editing landscapes with machine learning algorithms. Defining ADAR editing landscapes is paramount to biomarker discovery and can influence precision medicine applications in diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. This project will allow for me to gain the knowledge base necessary to become an independent researcher with a unique skill set of both computational and benchwork methods to advance the field of neuroscience. Project Narrative Inferring ADAR editing landscapes and their link with ion homeostasis and excitatory signaling in the brain is important for understanding, diagnosing or staging neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder and suicide. This proposed project will develop and validate computational tools to use RNA-seq from publicly available datasets for ADAR editing inferences and to delineate patterns of editing changes in cells experiencing viral infections. Overall, this project will give me the training to build my unique skill set of both computational and experimental methods that will enable me as an independent researcher to bridge the gap between bioinformatics and experimental researchers and translate my findings into precision medicine.",ADAR-editing landscape dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders,9992699,F31MH123131,"['Accounting', 'Anxiety', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Economic Burden', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Fura-2', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'High-Throughput RNA Sequencing', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Innate Immune System', 'Interferon Activation', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Ions', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'PF4 Gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'accomplished suicide', 'adenosine deaminase', 'biomarker discovery', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'data visualization', 'detector', 'differential expression', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'dopaminergic differentiation', 'excitotoxicity', 'experience', 'immune activation', 'in silico', 'innate immune pathways', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mood regulation', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel marker', 'precision medicine', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'release of sequestered calcium ion into cytoplasm', 'serotonin receptor', 'side effect', 'skills', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virtual machine']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,29830,-0.06011252619711475
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy Summary In the past decade, we have witnessed a revolutionary progress in camera technology and the attainable resolution of macromolecular assemblies via cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting 3D maps to atomic resolution structures. Whereas single- particle cryo-EM today is capable of directly solving atomic structures of biomolecular assemblies in isolation, electron tomography (ET) in unstained frozen-hydrated samples is widely used to capture the 3D organization of supramolecular complexes in their native (organelle, cell, or tissue) environments. We have identified three inter-related research areas where our computational modeling experience (historically rooted in pre-revolution multi-scale approaches) offers the biggest value to today's post-revolution EM community: (1) medium resolution cryo-EM modeling, (2) the segmentation and denoising of cryo-ET data, and (3) the validation of atomic models and their corresponding maps. The first aim is an extension of promising new ideas in flexible fitting as well as secondary structure prediction for medium resolution maps, which have been our key research areas in the past. medium resolution (5-10Å) maps are still widely used in EM and can be of significant biological importance. This is particularly true in the case of cryo-ET maps, which are harder to read than single particle cryo-EM maps because they often exhibit considerable noise, anisotropic resolution, and anisotropic density variations due to the low dose requirements and the missing wedge in the Fourier space. In the case of tightly packed or crowded macromolecular structures, the fusion of nearby biomolecular densities prevents an automated segmentation of geometric shapes, requiring a labor-intensive manual tracing by human experts. We are currently developing novel computational approaches to provide a more objective strategy for missing wedge correction in homogeneous specimen areas of tomograms. Our hybrid approach combines deconvolution and denoising with template matching in a unified mathematical framework that allows modeling constraints to be imposed in a least-squares optimization process. Our approach can also be extended to the flexible refinement of atomic structures using our damped dynamics flexible fitting approach by tuning the internal point-spread functions to the missing wedge of the ET data. To support these aims, we will quantitatively measure the fitness of an atomic model in local density regions and characterize the fitness of maps with reliable reference structures. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include the refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, bacterial chemoreceptor arrays, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established Internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages and as plugins for the popular UCSF Chimera graphics program. Project Narrative This project will help biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels, from the atomic to the living organism. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Mapping the Secondary Metabolomes of Marine Cyanobacteria Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways. However, the complete structure elucidation of natural products is often the most time consuming and costly endeavor in natural product drug discovery programs. Compounding this, advancements in genome sequencing have accelerated the identification of unique modular biosynthetic gene clusters in prokaryotes and revealed a wealth of new compounds yet to be isolated and biologically and chemically characterized. Resultantly, there is an urgent and continuing need in this field to connect biosynthetic gene clusters to their respective MS fragmentation signatures in the MS2 molecular networks. The capacity to make such connections will accelerate new compound discovery as well as create associations between gene cluster and biosynthetic pathway, and aid in fast and accurate structure elucidations. Combined with this informatics approach, this proposed continuation project explores innovative methods by which to solve complex molecular structures by enhanced MS and NMR experiments, as well as the development of new algorithms by which to accelerate their analysis. Thus, the overarching goal of this grant is to develop efficient methods that facilitate automated structural classification, structural feature discovery and ultimately efficient structure elucidation of natural products (or any small molecule) and to build an infrastructure that interacts with data input from the community. We will achieve this with the following four specific aims: Aim 1. Integration of MS2 molecular networking with gene cluster networking to rapidly and efficiently locate natural products that have unique molecular architectures; Aim 2. To develop a suite of high sensitivity pulse sequences for natural product structure elucidation; Aim 3. To develop NMR based molecular networking strategies using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to facilitate the categorization and structure elucidation of organic compounds; Aim 4. To integrate NMR molecular networking and MS2-based molecular networking as an efficient structure characterization and elucidation strategy. By achieving these aims we will develop an innovative workflow for finding new compounds and for determining their structures, both quickly and accurately. The connection between gene cluster and molecule will shed light on stereochemistry and potential halogenations and methylations. This information can then be used in combination with more efficient NMR and MS methods to accurately determine structures. These tools will be widely shared, such as through the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Network, to enhance the overall capacity of the natural products and organic chemistry communities to solve complex molecular structures.   Natural products are compounds produced by natural sources and about 50 % of FDA approved drugs can trace their origin back to natural products. This proposal aims to use our data set of natural products produced by cyanobacteria for development of analytical tools that will speed- up and stream-line the discovery and structure elucidation of new compounds.  ",Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products,9921415,R01GM107550,"['Algae', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Light', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'analog', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'genome sequencing', 'halogenation', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'small molecule', 'social', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,514429,-0.006796157378288696
"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating infor- mation about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commer- cial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to for- malizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to be- come the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  In Phase 1 CDD developed the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. In Phase 2 CDD will continue to develop a sophisticated automated transla- tion tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that ma- chine readable mixture descriptions can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxi- cology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accu- rately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicol- ogy of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,9902210,R44TR002528,"['Academia', 'Adoption', 'Ally', 'Books', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Commercial Catalogs', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shorthand', 'Solvents', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Traction', 'Translations', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'male', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'structured data', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2020,748733,-0.007077587940372404
"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9987332,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'human disease', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'structured data', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2020,585552,0.040964687187462656
"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging.

"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology.

"High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy High accuracy computational methods for biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important condensed phase probes of composition, structure and dynamics of biomolecules and bio-organic species. NMR observables such as chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings can be measured to very high accuracy, and are sensitive both to the functional groups that are present and to their detailed geometries and chemical environment. As such these NMR measurements could be used to develop protein structures with a quality equivalent to high resolution X-ray crystallography but in their native aqueous environments. The connection to structure, while true in principle, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to reveal in practice through direct assignment of the spectrum. Simulation methods that accurately predict spectral observables from structure are a key goal for spectral assignment. Such methods are even more crucial for the inverse problem of realizing high quality NMR structures of folded proteins from spectra, and as powerful restraints for determining the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Existing approaches to this problem typically rely on semi-empirical heuristics, and while they have achieved considerable success, they also reveal limitations that significantly degrade the quality of structural prediction. In this proposal, we will develop a new, first principles quantum mechanical (QM) based approach to simulation of NMR spectral observables for condensed phase biomolecules and bio-organics. Rapid prototyping of new QM methods will be enabled by the development of a distinctive in-silico NMR laboratory that applies finite magnetic fields and nuclear spins. From this capability, new methods for chemical shifts and spin-spin splittings will emerge that offer improved accuracy versus cost tradeoffs, and will be employed to populate databases that reflect protein relevant and energetically accessible environments. With such data, both artificial neural networks and Bayesian supervised learning approaches will determine a quantitative relationship between structure and computed NMR observable, and the resulting eQMCalculator will be tested on the refinement of folded proteins and creation of structural ensembles for IDPs. Project Title: High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy NMR shifts and splitting measurements for organic materials containing 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei can provide detailed descriptions of the structure of drug molecules, folded proteins and their complexes, as well as the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However there are currently limitations of turning accurate NMR measurements into accurate structures that clearly hampers advances that could be made on connecting structure to function of proteins in their native aqueous environments. This proposal aims to significantly improve the ability to predict the chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin couplings to yield the spectrum associated with a given folded structure or IDP ensemble of structures, with very high accuracy, and with good computational efficiency.",High Accuracy Computational Methods for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,9875487,U01GM121667,"['Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Magnetism', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Phase', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantum Theory', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Solvents', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'aqueous', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cost', 'database structure', 'drug structure', 'experimental study', 'functional group', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'in silico', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic field', 'personalized approach', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'response', 'restraint', 'simulation', 'structured data', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vibration']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,U01,2020,297077,-0.04981488421842223
"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,9896829,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,312660,-0.014814832471888006
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"RNA Sequencing Via Single Reverse Transcript Assessments Project Summary While very substantial progress has been made over the last 10 or so years with regards to next generation sequencing (NGS) and third generation sequencing (TGS) of DNA, the development of novel and enabling tool sets for RNA sequencing has lagged significantly. During this project, we aim to make significant progress with regards to that gap by developing and validating an entirely new solid-state sequencing platform, developed specifically and ideally for direct RNA sequencing, including its structural complexities and nucleotide modifications, all with high accuracy. While there are over 100 known RNA nucleotide modifications, due to the lack of analytical characterization methods available, the exact roles of these modifications remain to be determined. The technology that will be developed during the project will be capable of elucidating the roles of these modifications, and revolutionizing our understanding and use of the transcriptome/epitranscriptome. Project Narrative A method/technology capable of directly (without transcription) sequencing RNA, with extremely high accuracy and the inherent ability to identify nucleotide modifications, has the potential to revolutionize the use of the transcriptome and epitranscriptome, radically change standard R&D practices, as well as enable revolutionary diagnostics and therapeutics. The entirely new direct RNA sequencing methodology/technology that will be developed during this project will overcome known hurdles and limitation with currently available NGS, TGS, and single-molecule sequencing (SMS) approaches, resulting in technology that is cost efficient, highly accurate, easy-to setup and utilize, capable of de novo sequencing and modified base calling, and capable of producing highly simplistic data for easy analysis and post possessing.",RNA Sequencing Via Single Reverse Transcript Assessments,9961426,R43HG011070,"['Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Caliber', 'Carbon Nanotubes', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Electrodes', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inosine', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Length', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Phase', 'Polymerase', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudouridine', 'RNA', 'RNA primers', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Reader', 'Reading Frames', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Generation Sequencing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'electric field', 'epigenomics', 'epitranscriptome', 'epitranscriptomics', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'nanopore', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'programs', 'research and development', 'sequencing platform', 'single molecule', 'solid state', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,"ELECTRONIC BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2020,279999,0.02266746117006836
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9939578,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'algorithm development', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'engineered T cells', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'immunoglobulin structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'structured data', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,321599,-0.03713673584886653
"Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM PROJECT SUMMARY Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has recently joined X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy as a high-resolution structural method for biological macromolecules. In addition, cryo-EM produces images of individual molecules, and therefore has the potential to resolve conformational changes. The proposal aims to develop new algorithms and software for extending the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing computational tools for cryo-EM. This extension requires solving two of the most challenging computational problems posed by cryo-EM. First, mapping the structural variability of macromolecules is widely recognized as the main computational challenge in cryo-EM. Structural variations are of great significance to biologists, as they provide insight into the functioning of molecular machines. Existing computational tools are limited to a small number of distinct conformations, and therefore are incapable of tackling highly mobile biomolecules with multiple, continuous spectra of conformational changes. The first area of investigation in this project is the development of a computational framework to analyze continuous variability. The proposed approach is based on a new mathematical representation of continuously changing structures and its efficient estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. MCMC algorithms have found great success in many other scientific disciplines, yet they have been mostly overlooked for cryo-EM single particle analysis. Second, a major limiting factor for present cryo-EM studies is the molecule size. Images of small molecules (below ~50kDa) have too little signal to allow existing methods to provide valid 3-D reconstructions. It is commonly believed that cryo-EM cannot be used for molecules that are too small to be reliably detected and picked from micrographs. Challenging that widespread belief, the second area of investigation focuses on developing a groundbreaking approach for reconstructing small molecules directly from micrographs without particle picking. The new approach is based on autocorrelation analysis and completely bypasses particle picking and orientation assignment and requires just one pass over the data. The single-pass approach opens new possibilities for real-time processing during data acquisition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Determining structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, and a first step in rational drug design. We propose to develop new, faster and more reliable computer algorithms to significantly increase the power of structure-determination using electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM).

"Methods for improving clinical diagnostic by detection, prediction, interpretation and prioritization of aberrant transcriptome variations The goal of this research program project is to develop methods to improve clinical diagnosis of children with rare Mendelian disorders. Even with the most advanced standard-of-care genetic test of exome sequencing (ES) diagnostic rate is still below 50%. One reason for this rate is that mutations in non-protein coding regions or those that are synonymous (code for the same protein) are generally discarded even though these could be deleterious due to their effect on the processing of RNA transcribed from the underlying gene. We propose 2 complementary methods to help improve clinical diagnosis: The first is “RNA-first”, where our algorithms suggest which clinically accessible tissue (CAT) to use for RNA sequencing, then compare the results to a larger pool of donors to detect which RNA processing variations may be deleterious. The second is a “DNA-first” approach where we develop “RNA splicing code” models that predict the effect of genetic variations on RNA processing in a given tissue of interest. The two approaches, “RNA-first” and “DNA-first”, will be combined into a clinical diagnostic pipeline at the Children Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and applied to solve undiagnosed cases at CHOP and other centers, including the NIH’s Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN). Many children who are born with multiple medical issues have a genetic cause for their differences, but even the best tests cannot identify the genetic cause. This project will develop new computer technology to do a more complete analysis of their genetic testing information to help diagnose more of these children.","Methods for improving clinical diagnostic by detection, prediction, interpretation and prioritization of aberrant transcriptome variations",10033447,R01LM013437,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Benchmarking', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Human', 'International', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Mutation', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'causal variant', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'congenital anomaly', 'deep learning', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,347736,0.007685639814405638
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9995511,R01GM123314,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'K-562', 'K562 Cells', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Location', 'MALAT1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Recognition Motif', 'RNA metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Running', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'deep sequencing', 'differential expression', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive tools', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,302789,-0.019508454242437422
"Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines The “Computational Models of Immunity” projects in this application focus on development and implementation of new structure-based design tools for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein trimer interface specific antibodies or vaccine antigens. These projects will use knowledge about the structure and function of human neutralizing antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head that we have in hand or will discover, in order to design new antibodies or vaccines in silico. We have access to peripheral blood cells from a diverse panels of subjects with prior natural infection, or exposure to experimental inoculation with vaccines encoding HA molecules with both seasonal vaccines and unusual experimental influenza subtypes, including H3variant, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 viruses. The immune B memory cell populations from these individuals are the ideal starting materials to isolate unusual heterosubtypic antibodies. Recently, we identified the HA head trimer interface as a major new site of vulnerability for universal influenza antibodies and candidate vaccines. Here, we will study existing and isolate additional broadly heterosubtypic human antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head. We will determine the immunome of the responding heterosubtypic clones using high-throughput next generation sequencing of antibody gene repertoires that comprise the clonal lineages of the most heterosubtypic antibodies isolated. Once antibodies with unusual breadth or activity are isolated, the structure of these antibodies will be determined in complex with purified HA molecules in the Structural Core using crystallography and single particle electron microscopy (EM) studies. Such structures will provide the coordinates for the modeling experiments using Rosetta. We will in silico mature human antibodies to increase affinity for the HA antigen of specific virus types and use multi-state design to maximize breadth, i.e., create antibodies that recognize HAs of all clades, subtypes, groups, or even types. We then will synthesize and express these novel antibodies and determine neutralization activity, binding affinity, and competition binding groups of designed antibodies, using a diverse HA panel and pseudotyped viruses with all type A HAs in nature. The co-crystal structure of these human antibodies with HA will be the template for in silico design of structurally stable epitope-focused immunogens. We will first validate these designed immunogens by testing the interaction with the target human antibodies. Further, these immunogens will be experimentally tested by evaluating immune responses. Then, we will use the novel immunogens to isolate new antibodies from subjects naturally exposed to influenza, to show that the immunogens present antigens recognized by natural immune responses. The next generation of viral vaccines and biologics alike will be designed rationally, based on a structural understanding of how protective antibodies engage the epitope of the target. The multidisciplinary group in this application will develop and implement new structure based computational models, and then validate the power of the computational design approach with laboratory experiments focused on the structural basis of broad neutralization of influenza through recognition of the a novel site of vulnerability in the interface of the hemagglutinin head domain.",Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines,9950456,U01AI150739,"['Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exposure to', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antibody engineering', 'base', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular recognition', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoparticle', 'neutralizing antibody', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'particle', 'programs', 'protective efficacy', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'tool', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2020,1265006,-0.015988355417057447
"Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Prashant K. Purohit, John L. Bassani, Valeri Barsegov and John W. Weisel The goal of this proposal is to explore and understand the fracture toughness of blood clots and thrombi, thus providing a mechanistic basis for life-threatening thrombotic embolization. A combination of experiments, theoretical modeling and computer simulations will reveal how mechanical stresses (due to blood flow) in synergy with enzymatic lysis induce structural damage from the molecular to continuum scales and affect the propensity of a clot to embolize. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) Measure and model fracture toughness of fibrin gels in quasi-static conditions, (2) Investigate rate dependent dissipative effects on toughness of fibrin gels, and (3) Study the effects of blood cells, prothrombotic blood composition, and fibrinolysis on rupture of blood clots. In Specific Aim (SA) 1, we will measure toughness of fibrin clots and provide a structural basis for rupture at the micron and nanometer scales. In SA2, we will delve into the thermodynamics and rate-dependence of the fracture of fibrin gels, including fluid flow through pores and fluid drag on fibrin fibers to capture how energy dissipation increases toughness. In the translational SA3, we will investigate toughness of physiologically relevant clots with effects of platelets, red blood cells, and neutrophils in the absence and presence of the physiological fibrinolytic activator (tPA). We will also study the rupture of clots made from the blood of venous thromboembolism patients to explore the effects of (pro)thrombotic alterations of blood composition on clot mechanical stability. Our preliminary studies show that i) the toughness of cross-linked fibrin gels is in the range of those for synthetic hydrogels, ii) the addition of tPA to a crack tip reduces the loads for crack growth, iii) fibers are aligned and broken along the tensile direction at the crack tip, and iv) crack propagation results from the rupture of covalent and non-covalent bonds. We also developed v) dynamic force spectroscopy in silico to mechanically test fibrin fibers and fibrin networks using pulling simulations and vi) atomic stress approach to map the stress-strain fields using the output from simulations. We will use continuum and finite element models of swellable biopolymer hydrogels, and statistical mechanical models for the forced unfolding of fibrin molecules. We will employ multiscale computational modeling based on Molecular Dynamics simulations of atomic structures of fibrin fibers, and Langevin simulations of fibrin networks accelerated on Graphics Processing Units. The proposed experiments cover the whole gamut of macroscopic tensile tests, shear rheometry, electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to visualize and quantitate the structural alterations of ruptured blood clots. Our experiments and modeling will help us to understand the mechanisms of thrombotic embolization and will address the clinically important question: why is there a strong association between clot structure/mechanical properties and cardiovascular diseases? The new knowledge will also help to design new hydrogel-based biomaterials that are currently at the forefront of research in mechanics, materials science and bioengineering. Project Narrative The research objective of this proposal is to measure, model and predict the mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi at the molecular and continuum length scales.

"Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads Project Summary RNA modifications are pervasive throughout the human transcriptome and affect transcript stability, localization, and function. In particular, ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) edits in RNA have been shown to affect pre-mRNA splicing and alter codon sequence. Amino acid changes caused by inosines have been implicated in various deleterious conditions, which include cancer and diseases of the brain. However, previous literature mapping inosine positions in high-throughput were only able to do so inside the limited context provided by short RNA-Seq reads. As modifications can be transcript-specific, elucidating the association of inosines with full mRNA isoforms is crucial for a more rigorous understanding of the role of inosine modifications in the tissues of our body and, more broadly, disease. Therefore, I propose to investiate A-to-I editing in the context of diseased and non-diseased systems using full-length mRNA nanopore sequencing. The nanopore is able to sequence whole RNA strands by converting changes in electrical current caused by RNA translocating through the pore into nucleotide sequence. ​Aim 1 leverages high-accuracy nanopore cDNA sequencing of cellular systems with and without ADAR knockdown to interrogate ADAR function and A-to-I-induced changes to transcript expression changes. To accomplish the latter, I will develop workflows to determine isoform structure from noisy, long reads. In addition to sequencing full-length transcripts, nanopore native RNA (nvRNA) sequencing informs on RNA modifications, as modified nucleotides appear as subtle alteration in current signal with respect to canonical nucleotides. As such, ​Aim 2 ​employs a generalizable approach to producing cost-effective training data for systematically understanding how inosines alter current signals in nanopores. I will use a Cas13b-ADAR fusion protein (REPAIRv2) to create site-specific edits and then perform nvRNA sequencing on the edited transcriptome. Site-specific A-to-I editing allows this approach to create a labelled inosine dataset in nvRNA signal from which I can develop computational algorithms to reliably identify inosines in nvRNA data. The REPAIRv2 approach to can be generalized to eventually identify any RNA modification with nanopores. ​Aim 3 will elucidate how A-to-I editing differs between tissues. I will sequence 4 normal tissue types with nvRNA sequencing, generating a map of A-to-I edits in conjunction with isoform usage using the software I am developing. Taken together, the fulfillment of these aims will not only provide further insights on elusive ADAR mechanism, but also create workflows for nanopore data analysis and a platform for the study of any modification. As I work toward my Ph.D. with this interdisciplinary project, I will gain invaluable skills in experimental and computational biology that will prepare me for a career in science. Project Narrative Understanding the functional outcomes of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in greater depth is crucial to understanding cancer, diseases of the brain, and other deleterious effects that arise from modification misregulation. To study inosines in full-length mRNA contexts, we will use nanopore sequencing to generate a map of A-to-I editing in diseased and non-diseased transcriptomes. The objective of this proposal is to develop the experimental and computational requisites for identifying inosine modifications in nanopore native RNA sequencing data, particularly for illuminating the interplay between A-to-I editing, alternative splicing, and mRNA regulation.",Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads,9912024,F31HG010999,"['Address', 'Adenosine', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acids', 'Atlases', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breast', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enzymes', 'Exons', 'Functional disorder', 'Guanosine', 'Human', 'Inosine', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neurons', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Poly(A) Tail', 'Polyadenylation', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Work', 'adenosine deaminase', 'base', 'career', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'functional outcomes', 'human tissue', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'mRNA Precursor', 'machine learning method', 'nanopore', 'neuron loss', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,F31,2020,38613,0.04308999676986735
