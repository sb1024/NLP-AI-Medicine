"Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning Project Abstract Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals. Currently there are no proven effective therapies for treatment of advanced non-neovascular AMD, termed geographic atrophy (GA). Earlier intervention may be preferable, but this would require identification of those individuals with the highest risk for progression to atrophy. Over the last two decades, various studies including ours have identified several optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based factors that appear to associate with a higher risk for AMD progression. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important risk factors, yielding a better prediction of AMD progression risk than current subjectively specified features. In this proposal, we will first develop an AI- based system to automatically identify the “subjectively-specified” high risk factors based on individual spectral domain (SD) OCT 2D scans, and to automatically segment GA (the end-stage outcome variable of AMD) in OCT 2D en face maps. Subsequently, as a proof-of-concept study of our hypothesis, we will apply an AI-based “reverse learning” approach to objectively learn and identify AMD high risk factors in longitudinal OCT data. To achieve these objectives, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate an AI approach to classify individual OCT 2D scans as containing or not containing the pre-specified risk factor(s). In our previous work, we manually identified the presence or absence of the pre-specific high-risk factors and assigned to a risk score based on the entire OCT volume. Such approach was time consuming and not precise. In this proposal, an AI algorithm will be applied to detect the high risk factors from individual OCT scans. Hence, the precision of the scoring system can be greatly enhanced with high computational complexity. Aim 2: Develop and validate an AI approach to segment GA lesions from 2D OCT en face maps. For the OCT volumes having atrophy, we will perform the GA segmentation from the choroidal hypertransmission-resulted en face map using the multi-scale CNNs. Aim 3: Develop and validate an AI “reverse learning” approach to objectively identify the high risk factors using longitudinal OCT data. The “reverse learning” will be based on the multiple CNNs, followed by de- convolutional networks to identify the high risk factors objectively. Our previous scoring system will possibly be refined and optimized by the potential inclusion (or substitution) of novel risk factors derived from our objective AI approaches. The work in this proposal will be performed retrospectively in SD-OCT images from the image data pool that the multi-PI Sadda has aggregated over years as the director of the Doheny image reading center. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals and it may be preferable to intervene at an earlier stage in the disease process. We propose to use artificial intelligence techniques to automatically and objectively identify and quantify end-stage atrophy as well to identify the features on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), which are associated with a higher risk for progression to late atrophic AMD. This research should have implications for clinical practice in the staging and monitoring of AMD patients, as well as facilitating new therapeutic trials for AMD.",Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning,9807978,R21EY030619,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drusen', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Elderly', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'geographic atrophy', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'research study']",NEI,DOHENY EYE INSTITUTE,R21,2019,235500,0.042680392127380076
"Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning Project Summary Dr. Pappas is a junior faculty member in the Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, with appointments in the Center for Value-Based Care Research and the Department of Hospital Medicine (Cleveland, OH). This career development award aims to provide training in propensity methods, deep learning techniques, and pilot intervention development, ultimately seeking to identify personalized approaches to cardiac stress testing before surgery. Noncardiac surgery carries risk of mortality and morbidity, and cardiac complications account for the largest share of perioperative mortality. Meanwhile, current approaches are expensive and may not effectively reduce cardiac risk. This proposal uses machine learning techniques to define the value of information provided by each different kind of stress test and the expected benefit of different therapeutic interventions through which preoperative risks might be modified. It then seeks to identify the most helpful cardiac stress test, if any. In this career development award, Dr. Pappas proposes three phases of investigation, and in so doing will acquire new skills critical to achieving his goal of becoming an expert in perioperative risk mitigation. In Aim 1, Dr. Pappas will use propensity matching techniques to evaluate prior associations between preoperative stress testing and improved postoperative mortality, when including rich clinical data not available to previous large studies. In Aim 2, he will use machine learning techniques to estimate the value of information provided by each modality of stress testing, and the impact on the risk of each event from each intervention. In Aim 3, Dr. Pappas will pilot an intervention presenting personalized estimates to physicians in the preoperative clinic. In addition to advanced training through formal coursework, this career development award is supported by an extraordinary mentorship team, including internationally-recognized experts in perioperative outcomes research, cardiovascular disease, use of observational healthcare data, and machine learning. The combination of formal training and mentored research outlined in this application is designed to ensure that Dr. Pappas will emerge from this award as an independent investigator and expert in personalized perioperative decision-making. Project Narrative Many patients die soon after surgery, and many of those deaths are from heart problems. Physicians have tried to reduce those risks in many ways, but our current approach is expensive, leads to unhelpful testing, and probably doesn't do a very good job reducing the risk of death. This proposal uses a form of machine learning and a large dataset to try to find more personalized, more helpful, and less expensive strategies to try to reduce the risks of surgery, and then tests whether we can present personalized estimates to doctors that they could use when thinking about the risks of surgery.",Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning,9664901,K08HL141598,"['Appointment', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hospital Departments', 'Information Theory', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative complication', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Stress Tests', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'functional status', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'perioperative mortality', 'personalized approach', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic value', 'randomized trial', 'risk mitigation', 'skills', 'surgical risk', 'therapy development', 'treatment center']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K08,2019,161047,0.01808326612128119
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this ﬁeld typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind admis- sion risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modiﬁable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital ad- missions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classiﬁcation models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to signiﬁcantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close men- toring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a support- ive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identiﬁcation and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,9681485,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'social', 'supportive environment', 'trend', 'trial design']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2019,195076,0.010059440125632745
"SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in technology, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare costs in the U.S. Yet, there is a tremendous gap in accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in CVD risks and outcomes for disaggregated Hispanic and Asian subgroups. The current cardiovascular risk assessment tools have not been well-validated in these diverse populations, and it remains largely unknown why minority patients are less likely to start and more likely to stop life-saving therapies. The overall goal of Dr. Rodriguez’s K01 application is to address gaps in knowledge about CVD prediction and treatment in understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. The proposed study will utilize the electronic health record (EHR) data from an established NHLBI-funded cohort enriched with disaggregated Hispanic and Asian patients. Using this cohort, Dr. Rodriguez will first test the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups using a large diverse mixed-payer cohort of 1,234,751 patients from two large healthcare systems in Northern California and Hawaii. Secondly, she will build new CVD risk prediction models for diverse patient subgroups using machine learning techniques. Finally, she will identify reasons for statin underuse and discontinuation using natural language processing in the EHR. This study, which will evaluate existing data from real-world clinical practice in a stable population, will inform future risk prediction models and cholesterol treatment guidelines for diverse racial/ethnic groups. The proposal is aligned with the NHBLI’s strategic goals to eliminate health disparities and inequities by leveraging epidemiology and data science to understand and solve complex health problems. This proposal will also prepare Dr. Rodriguez to meet her long-term goal of becoming a national leader and independent investigator in CVD prevention and minority health. The proposed didactic and applied data science experiences, including training in advanced epidemiological methods and machine learning, will prepare Dr. Rodriguez to apply her research to other areas of CVD prevention and populations. This training program builds on the strengths of Stanford University in health services research, epidemiology, and biomedical informatics. Her mentorship team, led by Dr. Latha Palaniappan, includes experts in cardiovascular prevention and health services research (Dr. Heidenreich, co-mentor), applied statistical analyses (Dr. Robert Tibshirani, advisor), machine learning in the EHR (Dr. Nigam Shah, advisor), and chronic disease prediction and medical decision making (Dr. Michael Pignone, advisor). Dr. Rodriguez’s team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal as well as overseeing her advanced training in their respective areas of expertise. The research and training plan proposed in this K01 application will develop Dr. Rodriguez into a unique and highly-skilled clinician researcher ready to compete for R-level funding and launch her independent research career. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S., yet current CVD risk prediction algorithms fail to adequately assess risk in these populations. The proposal will address this substantial knowledge gap by validating current risk prediction models in racial/ethnic minority subgroups, improving risk prediction using modern machine learning techniques, and identifying reasons for statin discontinuation. Findings from this study will provide the foundation for clinical guidelines, research agendas, and public health interventions to improve CVD prevention strategies in diverse populations. !",SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups),9645316,K01HL144607,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mexican Americans', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Puerto Rican', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'South Asian', 'Stable Populations', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'college', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'epidemiologic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health difference', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevention service', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'random forest', 'risk prediction model', 'side effect', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,172692,0.029993431955444825
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9610723,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,794994,0.01132608348114026
"Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes ABSTRACT Diabetic patients are at risk of developing diabetic heart disease, which may lead to complications in care. Diabetic heart disease patients not only have exceptionally high healthcare expenditures and resource utilization but also are likely to have poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that early intervention of patients likely to develop diabetic heart disease is cost-effective and yields favorable health outcomes. Therefore, early identiﬁcation of diabetic patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease is crucial to provide effective interventions. The commonly accepted methodology for diabetic heart disease risk prediction is the use of one or more risk scoring systems. However, these risk functions may not generalize well for the diabetes patient and may suffer from poor calibration when used on different cohorts. Moreover, the scoring systems have only been studied on coronary heart disease, one variant of diabetic heart disease while heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy remain important, yet insufﬁciently studied problems. Machine learning offers the ability to perform accurate predictive analytics and has been proposed as a way to identify and manage high-risk patients. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a high-impact and practical risk prediction model that can be used to per- form early identiﬁcation of high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of patient information in electronic health records, the model needs to capitalize on the multi-dimensional temporal nature of pa- tient records to extract identifying characteristics of patients that will develop diabetic heart disease. To accomplish this, we will leverage modern machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization and natural language processing to model complex patient characteristics, provide a more complete representation of the patient, and uncover excellent predictors of diabetic heart disease risk. An existing dataset that contains the de-identiﬁed electronic health records of approximately 4,100 diabetic patients from the Emory Healthcare System to compare the predictive power of machine learning-based algorithms with the standard risk scoring systems. These algorithms will be evaluated on calibration, discrimination, and ease of interpretability. The results of this work will provide insight as to how to develop a machine learning–based prediction system that can identify high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. The study may also shed light on the best approaches for fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources to build a better predictive model and potentially identify novel indicators of high- risk diabetic heart disease factors. Moreover, the work will help inform a larger multi-site study of diabetic heart disease risk prediction and develop methods to generalize the results to a broader spectrum of comorbidities. This project is consistent with the National Library of Medicine's mission to translate biomedical research into practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic patients are risk of developing diabetic heart disease which can lead to high healthcare expenditure, high resource utilization, and poor patient outcomes. Existing diabetic risk prediction models can suffer from poor calibration and predictive accuracy.

"Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients Failure to rescue (FTR), a nurse-sensitive national metric of health care quality, refers to death of a hospitalized patient from a treatable complication, and is potentiated by failure to recognize and appropriately respond to early signs of complications. There is a paucity of research examining patient features predictive of FTR complications. Such information could shift the current paradigm of nursing surveillance to earlier recognition, prevention and treatment of FTR complications, thereby saving lives. New-onset venous thromboembolism (VTE), an FTR complication occurring as either a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE), is the leading cause of preventable hospital death, carrying a high risk of mortality and a national cost burden of $7 billion annually. VTE is a complex disease process involving interactions between clinical risk factors and acquired and/or inherited susceptibilities to thrombosis. Although biomarkers and clinical factors associated with VTE have been identified, clinical manifestations are subtle, presenting gradually over hours to days. Current VTE risk assessment models (RAM), the cornerstone of prevention, have limited utility due to their complexity and lack of reliability, generalizability and external validation. A critical gap in VTE risk modeling research is that while new-onset VTE pathology evolves over the course of hospitalization, no current models incorporate the progressive accrual of dynamic patient data and pattern evolution over time in their modeling approaches. The totality of routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data is massive in terms of volume, variety, and production at a rapid velocity in real-time. Such big data could be used in machine learning (ML) analytic approaches to process time series clinical data to identify subtle, evolving feature patterns predictive of new-onset VTE and address this gap. This study proposes to assemble a large scale, multi-source, multi-dimensional VTE study dataset, and in tandem, systematically define the EHR data elements associated with a new-onset VTE diagnosis for computable phenotype algorithm development. We will then apply machine learning analytic approaches to baseline and accruing intensive time series clinical data in the curated dataset to develop models identifying data patterns and features predictive of dynamically evolving new-onset VTE in adult hospitalized patients. This proposal aligns with NINR’s strategic vision for nurse scientists to employ new strategies for collecting and analyzing complex big data sets to permit better understanding of the biological underpinnings of health, and improve ways nurses prevent and manage illness. This innovative study and individualized training plan under a strong and well- established team, represents initial steps in the applicant’s research trajectory focused on data science approaches to predict FTR complication risk, and develop, implement and test dynamic RAMs to inform targeted prevention and treatment decisions. Discovering new knowledge informing real-time decision making, nursing surveillance practices and care delivery systems can improve nurse sensitive patient outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of preventable hospital death. This study first proposes to develop a reproducible computable phenotype definition for new-onset VTE cohort ascertainment from the electronic health record, and then develop dynamic models for VTE risk assessment through the application of machine learning algorithms to massive electronic health record clinical data repositories. Such models can inform the mechanisms underlying this complex disease and identify subtle pattern changes in a patient’s condition forecasting a VTE event, enabling earlier nurse identification and intervention, and decreasing the development of complications and failure to rescue in hospitalized patients.",Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients,9794015,F31NR018102,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Quality of Care', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Vision', 'base', 'care delivery', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multidimensional data', 'prevent']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2019,45016,0.012287541583472686
"Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Because suicidal behavior (i.e., suicide and suicide attempt) significantly contributes to global disease and financial burden, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, the World Health Organization, and prominent researchers have called for the need to develop and improve prediction models for suicidal behavior. The period after contact with a health care professional is a particularly high-risk period, suggesting that prediction of suicidal behavior in the short-term after contact (i.e., defined as within one year in most studies) would address a critical need in the field to aid intervention efforts. However, previous short-term research has been limited by numerous factors, including a lack of research on youth samples, an overreliance on self-report measures or electronic health records, and the frequent examination of bivariate associations between only one predictor and suicidal behavior. The overall objective of the current proposal is to utilize several algorithms and assess their relative performance in the prediction of short-term suicidal behavior after contact with an outpatient specialist (defined as within 1, 6, and 12 months) using an unparalleled dataset. I will use data from a prospective, large-scale register of all outpatient mental health specialist visits among youth in Stockholm County, Sweden, consisting of approximately 160,000 visits by the onset of the current award. These individuals can be linked to population-based registers assessing a broad range of information (e.g., medical problems, academic information, neighborhood factors, parental psychopathology), which is a significant advantage over prior literature primarily studying demographic and psychiatric predictors in isolation. The central hypothesis is that the examination of numerous predictors within a large sample and the use of advanced statistical methods will significantly improve upon previous suicidal behavior prediction, which has remained slightly above chance. To achieve the overall objective, the current proposal is designed to apply machine learning algorithms through two specific aims: Aim 1: Apply variable selection algorithms that determine a limited number of salient predictors and, therefore, maximize interpretability; Aim 2: Apply ensemble algorithms that aggregate machine learning models and, therefore, maximize predictive power. The current proposal will significantly contribute to the field by examining short-term risk using machine learning techniques among a youth, outpatient sample, including varying follow-up windows and predictors across domains. Finally, the results from the current proposal will have positive impact by informing both 1) basic research through the identification of at-risk subgroups based on numerous predictors, and 2) the creation of a prediction tool that will aid in clinical practice. Project Narrative Over the past 50 years, prediction of suicidal behavior has remained slightly above chance levels, significantly hindering the development of effective intervention strategies. Because the majority of those who attempt or die by suicide are in contact with a health care professional within the year prior to their death, the current proposal serves to fill a critical gap in suicidal behavior prediction by exploring prediction methods for suicidal behavior among youth in the short-term (i.e., within 1, 6, and 12 months) after contact with an outpatient mental health specialist using an unparalleled dataset. Findings from the current proposal will have implications for clinical practice by identifying high-risk individuals for short-term suicidal behavior and aid clinical decision-making.",Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach,9835007,F31MH121039,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sweden', 'Techniques', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'World Health Organization', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'translational pipeline']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F31,2019,45016,-0.11691989508263805
"Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease Project Summary  Cardiovascular disease negatively affects millions of people worldwide. Globally, it accounts for approximately thirty percent of all deaths. Furthermore, a significant fraction of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease occur in a non-geriatric population; fifteen percent of all worldwide deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease for people under the age of seventy. Treatment to prevent cardiovascular events should be based on highly individualized risk prediction. High risk patients should get more aggressive treatments because the risk of disease outweighs the burden of treatment, while low risk patients should be managed more conservatively. For example, anti-thrombotic therapy for coronary heart disease may increase bleeding risk and may not be appropriate for low-risk patients. Two primary kinds of cardiovascular disease are stroke and coronary heart disease, and there have been a number of developments in risk scores for both ailments. However, these risk scores only use a small fraction of the available measurements about a patient and treat risk as a collection of independent factors rather than considering how their interactions amplify or ameliorate risk. Moreover, a majority of the popular coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores are designed to be manually computed by a busy physician at the point of care, which further limits their scope and fidelity. Next generation risk scores for stroke and cardiovascular disease should take into account all of the available information in the electronic health record without the constraints of the parametric assumptions of traditional risk modeling. More accurate risk assessment of coronary heart disease and stroke will lead to better care and reduce the cardiovascular disease burden.  Our vision is to capitalize on large collections of electronic health records along with recent advances in deep learning to build risk scores that use more available health information while making minimal mathematical assumptions about the nature of clinical risk. Our proposal propels the field from human computable independent risks calculations necessitated by previous limitations of technology to calculations that make use of deep learning to learn highly nonlinear risks and risk factor interactions. We additionally demonstrate how deep learning can be used to deal with the ever-present issue of missing values in medicine. Our proposal also targets an area under- explored by previous work on risk scores: fairness. Treatment quality is affected by the quality of risk estimation. This means populations where estimated risk is less accurate may receive worse care. Risk scores developed with simple models may only capture risk accurately for the majority population as simple models are not flexible enough to cover multiple populations. We seek to identify potential risk calculation differences with respect to race and ethnicity. We will construct and evaluate deep learning methods for coronary heart disease and stroke risk assessment from electronic health records. We will develop techniques to incorporate clinical text, handle missing data, and evaluate fairness of deep learning for cardiovascular risk scores. Finally, we will make our work available as open source code written in deep learning frameworks, at clinical conferences, and publications. Project Narrative Coronary heart disease and stroke create a large burden of disease in the world and require accurate risk assessment to aid in providing appropriate treatments. We will construct and validate deep learning risk scores for both coronary heart disease and stroke using large quantities of information from the electronic health record and take care to evaluate potential racial and ethnic biases present in the algorithm. More accurate coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores provided by this approach have the potential to reduce the overall cardiovascular disease burden with a specific focus on minority communities.",Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease,9801981,R01HL148248,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical conference', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'ethnic bias', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'heart disease risk', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'negative affect', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'stroke model', 'stroke risk', 'thromboembolic stroke']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,709389,-0.03103387830186329
"Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major health problem affecting over 5 million people in the US leading to significant morbidity and even mortality. Therapy for this epidemic is suboptimal, with success of 30-70% at 1 year for most therapies. Despite great advances in understanding potential AF mechanisms, these insights have not yet translated into better AF therapy. The scientific focus of the project centers on the issue of identifying novel phenotypes for the heterogeneous conditions that currently fall under the rubric of AF. Machine learning is an approach well-suited to identify novel classifications from large diverse data sets that are traditionally difficult to separate. I will use machine learning and computational methods to analyze detailed clinical, structural, cardiac electrophysiological and biochemical features in patients with AF, to better predict responders and non-responders to various therapies. This may enable prospective guidance to tailor personalized therapy. In performing this project, I will grow as a physician-scientist focused on patient-oriented research in atrial fibrillation. The specific aims of the scientific project are as follows: First, I will create a novel disease taxonomy for AF that classifies patients successfully treated by risk factor modification, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, or diverse approaches to ablation, using computational methods and supervised learning on large training data from my collaborators. I will assess the predictive efficacy of these disease partitions in a testing cohort of patients referred for treatment of AF. Second, I will use advanced techniques in machine learning and patient-level analyses to explain why a certain strategy may fail or succeed in an individual, paving the way for clinical use. Third, in a pilot prospective clinical study, I will assess the feasibility and accuracy of these machine learning models. The findings from these experiments may provide an immediate clinical impact by delivering AF therapy options in a patient-specific manner that optimizes benefit while reducing risk. In addition, under the balanced and expert mentorship provided by this award, I will gain the necessary computational modelling, clinical research design and biostatistical methodology experience to design comprehensive studies and be competitive for independent funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent heart rhythm disorder in adults, which may lead to significant morbidity, mortality and economic burden. The results of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapy remain suboptimal, despite the fact that mechanistic data in patients are increasing on atrial structure, electrophysiology and clinical risk factors yet are rarely used to individualize AF therapy to each patient. In this project, computational methods and machine learning are proposed to harmonize large amounts of data, including clinical factors, imaging studies and cardiac signals, to provide tools to devise an individualized AF management strategy.",Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation,9821943,K23HL145017,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biometry', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Flecainide', 'Freedom', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Life Style Modification', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nonpharmacologic Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Registries', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Work', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'dofetilide', 'economic implication', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'functional outcomes', 'heart rhythm', 'imaging study', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,193536,0.02286508083997768
"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,9717330,K23AR075070,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calcium Pyrophosphate', 'Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diuretics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Female', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Structure', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vascular calcification', 'Vascularization', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bisphosphonate', 'calcium indicator', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'crystallinity', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'sex', 'side effect', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2019,176541,0.01568283610461114
"The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence Project Summary Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are the most common types of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the world. VBD epidemics have been increasing over recent decades, with tickborne diseases having doubled in the last decade in the United States. Despite the increase in public health burden, over 80% of vector-control organizations lack preventative capabilities. Understanding the interplay between the environment, vectors, pathogens, and humans that expedite disease spread remains a challenge. The overarching goal of this project is to identify the key environmental and human drivers that have led to the emergence of VBDs. Current models that predict tickborne disease risk have oversimplified the process by focusing only on the vector, i.e. risk of tick exposure. A human’s risk of infection is not only a function of entomological risk but also of factors inherent to the individual including behavior or characteristics that increase susceptibility to disease. This project proposes a novel approach to tickborne disease prediction by developing a comprehensive model that incorporate pathogen population dynamics and human factors to predict disease risk. This study will investigate several pathogens vectored by the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis): Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic anaplasmosis), and Babesia microti (babesiosis). The central hypothesis is that the prediction of tickborne disease risk can be improved by using sophisticated statistical methods to identify environmental drivers that impact pathogen population dynamics while incorporating human demographic characteristics. The hypothesis will be addressed in the following aims: (1) Determine the current and historical population dynamic patterns of pathogens vectored by I. scapularis to predict pathogen distribution; (2) Determine the association between human characteristics and tick-borne disease risk in order to develop an improved spatial disease risk model. This model will allow the identification and quantification of factors that are associated with the emergence of tickborne diseases in New York State, which is geographically advantageous because it is representative of much of the natural environment that ticks encounter in the northeastern US including rapid and recent changes in climate and landscapes. The results of this project will be used to develop a public disease warning system that will use contemporary and future climate forecasts to monitor tick populations and predict potential disease outbreaks for areas with vulnerable populations. With climate forecasts predicting an increase in 2-3°C in temperature by 2100, there is uncertainty in how diseases will shift and a warning system will allow preparation accordingly. At the completion of the proposed research project, the applicant will have acquired the following skillsets through intensive, interdisciplinary mentorship: big data analysis, advanced statistics including Bayesian and machine learning methods, spatial analyses, and risk analysis. This will enable the applicant to succeed as an independent investigator to address the challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases are the most common types of emerging infectious diseases in the world and constitute major threats to public health. My project uses advanced statistical methods to uncover how interactions between environmental factors affecting pathogen population dynamics and human demographic characteristics determine human risk for three tick-borne diseases: Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. The results of my project will be used to create a risk map to predict the spatial and temporal occurrence of tickborne diseases, which can inform public health strategies in order to mitigate disease burden.",The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence,9758579,F31AI133871,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anaplasma phagocytophilum', 'Anaplasmosis', 'Area', 'Award', 'Babesia microti', 'Babesiosis', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bite', 'Black-legged Tick', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Characteristics', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Contracts', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecological Change', 'Ecology', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Entomology', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'New York', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'Tick-Borne Infections', 'Ticks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'anthropogenesis', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cost effective', 'decision tree learning', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'environmental change', 'geographic population', 'granulocyte', 'human disease', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'learning strategy', 'model design', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogen exposure', 'predictive modeling', 'regression trees', 'spatial temporal variation', 'statistics', 'tick-borne pathogen', 'trend', 'vector', 'vector control', 'vector transmission']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2019,45016,0.021062590204118534
"Use of a machine learning framework to predict severe maternal morbidity Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) is on the rise in the United States. Such morbidity is accompanied by delivery complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and can have long- term health consequences for women. To date, only a handful of studies examined risk factors for SMM in the United States, and even fewer considered the site of delivery care as potentially influencing SMM occurrence. This study will test the use of machine learning techniques to develop models for predicting women’s risk of experiencing SMM. We will use population-based data from a family of Maryland state databases linked with American Hospital Association Annual Survey data for the 2010-2014 period. Our primary analytic sample will be comprised of all delivery hospitalizations in Maryland hospitals during 2010-2014. Two SMM outcome measures will be employed: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s SMM algorithm, and a composite measure that includes any of the codes in the CDC SMM algorithm, ICU admission and/or blood transfusion during the delivery hospitalization. Separately for each of the two outcome measures, we will first develop multi-stage least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) models to predict SMM and then employ Multiple Additive Regression Tree to maximize the predictive ability of the LASSO models. Next, we will fit Logit regression models for SMM adjusting for LASSO-selected predictor variables and compare LASSO and Logit models’ performance using standard metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve of receiver operator characteristic. The proposal has several areas of innovation. Classical analytics tools are not well suited to capture the full value of large data. In contrast, machine learning techniques are unconstrained by preset statistical assumptions and expected to make predictions with higher degrees of accuracy. The success of this pilot study will open up new avenues of study into the potential for machine learning to aid clinical care. Obstetrics is one of the areas that can greatly benefit from its use by predicting maternal risks early and optimizing pathways to the best possible outcomes for women and their newborns. Identifying key predictors of SMM can serve to ascertain health disparities, strengths and weaknesses in obstetric care, and prevent adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Severe maternal morbidity is on the rise in the United States and such morbidity can have long- term health consequences for women. This study will assess the potential use of new statistical methods, not currently employed in obstetrics, to develop prediction models for severe maternal morbidity during the delivery hospitalization. Our ability to predict a woman’s risk of developing severe maternal morbidity can help prevent such morbidity from occurring.",Use of a machine learning framework to predict severe maternal morbidity,9767258,R03HD095057,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Surgical Procedures', 'American Hospital Association', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Behavior', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Event', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Logit Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'care delivery site', 'care seeking', 'clinical care', 'delivery complications', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal morbidity', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neonatal outcome', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'regression trees', 'stillbirth', 'success']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,81875,0.016071518936120893
"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,9819327,R01DK116986,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'base', 'case-based', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injury prevention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'prevent']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,512304,-0.023652506474927167
"Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings Project Summary (Abstract) With little change in incidence for over 50 years, pneumonia remains the top cause for morbid hospitalization1 in the USA, and is associated with healthcare costs exceeding $10 billion annually2. This study proposes to mine big data captured in an intergrated medical/dental record (iEHR) and enterprise data warehouse (EDW) of a large midwestern medical-dental integrated healthcare system and will test the hypothesis that poor oral health is an independent risk for subtypes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Proposed specific aims include: 1) electronic identification and characterization of pneumonia types and 2) evaluation of the association of oral health status with risk of pneumonia. Tasks to achieve study aims are to: a) develop electronic, phenotype-based algorithm(s) to classify and characterize pneumonia by subtype and relative frequency of events; b) characterize impact of immediate and longitudinal oral health status on emergent pneumonia stratified by subtype; and c) evaluate relative risk contributed by medical and dental factors. Innovative application of natural language processing (NLP) to support evaluation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML) to identify as-yet unknown potential risk factors is proposed. These aims will be accomplished by established investigators including dentists and researchers with extensive research track records in oral and systemic health including pneumonia, clinical pulmonologist/intensivist to provide clinical expertise to inform data mining, biomedical informaticians with expertise in data mining, ML and NLP and data modeling, and experienced biostatisticians who will apply appropriate statistical approaches and traditional data modeling to big data. This team will collaboratively create and deliver a unique, well-defined, pneumonia- specific, oral health data registry resource and validated phenotype-based algorithm to classify pneumonia, stratified by subtypes, which will support future interrogation for additional permutations of medical and dental factors. Study outcomes are expected to leverage immediate translational value within the health system with high potential for relevance and portability to other settings. The project is expected to define risk factors which may represent actionable targets for reduction of pneumonia risk across various settings. Project Narrative- Relevance to public health: Pneumonia continues as a leading public health problem in hospitals, healthcare facilities and community settings. Pneumonia is the top disease-related cause for hospitalization. This study proposes to use data in electronic health records to classify pneumonia type and describe risk factors that may make individual susceptible to different types of pneumonia, including impact of diseases of the mouth, gums and teeth. The project expects to create models that can identify patients at risk for pneumonia based on information in their medical record so that those risks may be recognized and reduced.",Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings,9784789,R03DE027020,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Climate', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Hygiene', 'Dental Records', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Mouth Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nosocomial pneumonia', 'Oral', 'Oral health', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Periodontitis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal vaccine', 'Pneumonia', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Ventilator', 'Visit', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'case finding', 'clinically relevant', 'community setting', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outreach', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'pneumonia model', 'portability', 'secondary analysis', 'systems research', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia']",NIDCR,MARSHFIELD CLINIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION,R03,2019,159914,0.02508727611147618
"Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment Postoperative complications and readmissions rates are higher in minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) patients. Low SES is associated with frailty, one of the best predictors of 30-day postoperative complications and early hospital readmission. Despite their influence on health outcomes, frailty and social risk factors are not considered in risk adjustment for reimbursement and quality measures. CMS developed financial incentive- based programs to improve quality of care. Yet this strategy disproportionately penalizes minority-serving, major teaching and safety net hospitals (SNH), further constraining resources for the care of vulnerable populations. Our long-term goal is to use frailty and social risk factors to identify at-risk patients to design more effective clinical care pathways. Frailty can be derived retrospectively using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) dataset. Data networks are powerful research tools that can be used to answer important questions. However, extracting data from EHR is challenging. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) developed 13 Clinical Data Research Networks (CDRN) that have considerable overlapping membership with Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) institutions. While steady progress has been made, multiple barriers exist to efficiently access and use data. We will engage 3 CTSA hubs, each members of a different CDRN, to locally merge identified datasets developing data accessing and linking strategies at diverse institutions for dissemination across sites within CDRNs and to ultimately perform similar studies across CDRNs. We will use the SMART IRB reliance platform to harmonize the regulatory approval process as much as possible for each step of this project to identify barriers to use in data networks. We propose the following Aims: 1) Determine the predictive power of ethnicity, race, SES, and frailty for postoperative complications, mortality  and readmissions to improve risk adjustment at 3 CTSA/CDRNs 2) Estimate postoperative functional status using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning  algorithms on inpatient physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and nursing notes for ACS NSQIP  patients to predict long-term functional status 3) Develop methods to predict long-term loss of independence after major surgery 4) Determine hospital resource utilization stratified by SES, frailty and minority status The significance of our study is the incorporation of social risk factors, frailty and functional status in risk adjustment forming the basis for future interventions by targeting patients at the highest risk for postoperative complications and reducing health care disparities. Our innovative approach harnesses data sources at diverse institutions with the goal of disseminating these methods across 3 CDRNs and the CTSA network. Project Narrative: Patients with social risk factors, including poverty, being a minority, lack of an education and frailty are all associated with having worse health outcomes and with more difficulties recovering after surgical procedures. Safety net hospitals take care of many people with social risk factors and are being judged on the quality of care provided without accounting for the challenges faced by poor people. We will study the effect of social risk factors and frailty on health outcomes after surgery to identify patients that would benefit from care pathways that help poor and/or frail people.","Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment",9749954,U01TR002393,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Community Surveys', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physical therapy', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Recovery of Function', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic data', 'financial incentive', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'payment', 'postoperative recovery', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'readmission rates', 'safety net', 'simulation', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,U01,2019,100000,0.044029561234000085
"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",9640524,R01DK119860,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Caring', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'disorder subtype', 'elastography', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'liver injury', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,462750,0.010804230054291568
"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome,9885029,R01MH119185,"['22q11.2', '3-Dimensional', 'Acoustic Rhinometry', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ear', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nasal cavity', 'Neurobiology', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Cortex', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oral cavity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Societies', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Work', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conotruncal anomaly face syndrome', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microdeletion', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory sulcus', 'precision medicine', 'psychotic symptoms', 'resilience', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,746845,0.0026322664699893377
"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,9681505,R01MH116969,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neural correlate', 'pleasure', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'socioeconomics', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2019,584268,0.02250107505404865
"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for evaluating angle closure patients despite its limited ability to quantify PACD severity and predict progression to PACG.

"2/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored.

"Developing data tools to reduce CVD disparities via Health Information Exchanges ABSTRACT CVD disparities across the race/ethnic and socioeconomic gradients are exacerbated by barriers to receiving guideline-based primary or secondary preventive treatment—such as appropriate blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes treatment.1–6 Most patients not receiving guideline-based treatment are actually insured and have seen a primary care provider in the past year.1 To reduce CVD disparities by better targeting disease prevention and treatment, healthcare administrators and county departments of public health have begun pooling data resources across healthcare and public health systems—such as across clinics, emergency rooms and hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories, and administrative datasets.7–9 The idea behind pooling such datasets is to better identify persons most in need, and direct targeted interventions to them. Solano County, California, a medium-sized, diverse, low-income county, has developed one of the first, and most comprehensive health information exchanges (HIEs), including: (i) electronic health record data from all emergency rooms, hospitals, primary care and specialty clinics and care facilities in the county; (ii) labs from all laboratory service providers; (iii) prescription details from all pharmacies; (iv) validated social determinants of health surveys administered in clinics; and (v) administrative datasets, including welfare, disability, housing, and geocoded neighborhood features. While several other counties are following suit to develop large, secure HIEs across healthcare and public health systems, a key challenge remains: how to cheaply, accurately, and rapidly analyze HIEs to identify which persons should be targeted for interventions. Without reliable, user- friendly, cost-effective, and generalizable data analysis programs, counties are unable to use the massive data at their disposal to address preventable causes of morbidity and mortality. The objective of this application is to apply our unique machine-learning innovations to develop open-source programs that can enable counties to identify persons at high risk for preventable CVD events and deaths. We will test the hypothesis that electronic health record data alone are insufficient to provide accurate risk prediction for preventable CVD events and deaths. Rather, we believe that key survey and administrative data providing information on social determinants of health will improve identification of high-risk patients. To test our hypothesis, we will develop and validate open-source, generalizable programs to: (Aim 1) rapidly identify persons in need of improved primary and secondary prevention of CVD by systematically comparing the performance of three alternative machine learning approaches to read HIE data, as compared to human clinician chart reviewers; and (Aim 2) perform multi-level risk assessment by automatically calibrating and validating models of CVD event risk, utilization and cost to HIE data, to identify the added value of administrative and social determinants data as compared to clinical or claims-based data alone. Our work will produce generalizable software tools for counties across the country to analyze HIE data and reduce preventable CVD disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities are exacerbated by inadequate guideline-based treatment of CVD risk factors. Furthermore, risk adjustment models currently used to target interventions and pay for healthcare services only use claims-based data such as demographics and clinical diagnostic codes, ignoring social determinants of health. Our research will rigorously develop and test novel machine learning methods that incorporate social determinants data from large Health Information Exchanges, producing novel data tools that will enable health systems nationwide to better detect individuals who could use improvements in their preventive therapy for CVD, and improve risk adjustment models to identify persons at high risk for preventable healthcare utilization and cost.",Developing data tools to reduce CVD disparities via Health Information Exchanges,9766361,R21MD012867,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Blood Pressure', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Case Management', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Surveys', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Neighborhoods', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Primary Health Care', 'Primary Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Secure', 'Social Work', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Unemployment', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular disorder therapy', 'care providers', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disorder prevention', 'health care service', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'payment', 'programs', 'prospective', 'residence', 'risk prediction model', 'safety net', 'semiparametric', 'service providers', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'treatment disparity', 'user-friendly', 'welfare']",NIMHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,190864,0.03566317608086192
"Cancer Prevention through Dietary Change: Training in translational neuroimaging PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Unhealthy eating increases the risk of developing several kinds of cancer. This occurs directly through consumption of carcinogenic food, and indirectly through overweight and obesity. Because nearly 70% of American adults are overweight or obese, it is critical to develop effective interventions to alter eating behavior. One key factor that influences eating behavior and weight gain is cue-induced food craving. Craving stimulates appetitive motivation to eat, but can be regulated via cognitive strategies such as reappraisal, or the reconstrual of a stimulus to change its affective meaning. Reappraisal increases the salience of consumption- related costs and reduces food craving for unhealthy food. Craving reappraisal is therefore a promising target for interventions designed to reduce unhealthy eating and risk for diet-related cancers. However, individual differences in treatment efficacy remain a persistent problem with interventions. To understand why an intervention works for some individuals and not for others requires clearly defined neurobiological mechanisms of change, as well as sensitive and specific tools to evaluate individual differences in psychological targets. To fill this gap, the goal of this project is to leverage machine learning and multivariate neuroimaging methods to develop and validate a sensitive and specific neural signature of craving reappraisal that can be used as a neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability. To achieve this goal, this project will pursue the following Aims: 1) develop and validate a neural signature of craving reappraisal in an independent sample of existing data, and 2) establish the predictive and incremental validity the neural signature in the context of an ongoing randomized control trial of cognitive reappraisal training to reduce unhealthy eating in overweight and obese adults. Specifically, after development, I will test the construct validity of the neural signature by assessing whether expression of the signature is greater while participants reappraise their desire for craved food than while they simply view these foods (Aim 1). I will also test the predictive and incremental validity of the neural signature by assessing the extent to which individual differences the neural signature change predict intervention outcomes, such as the value of unhealthy food and eating behavior, above and beyond standard methods (Aim 2). Upon completion of this project, I will have developed and validated a sensitive and specific neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability that can be readily used by other researchers to evaluate intervention efficacy and individual differences in responsivity to treatment. I will also receive in-depth training in translational neuroscience interventions for cancer control, and multivariate neuroimaging and machine learning. This work will facilitate the refinement of reappraisal-based interventions to reduce unhealthy eating that will ultimately reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity and risk for diet-related cancers. Further, by documenting my analysis process and sharing my analysis code, the results of this work can readily be adopted by others to study a variety of psychological processes relevant to eating behavior and cancer risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive reappraisal can be used to reduce food craving and unhealthy eating (a key risk factor for several kinds of cancer), but interventions to train reappraisal ability are not equally effective for all individuals. This project aims to leverage multivariate neuroimaging and machine learning techniques to develop an objective, neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability that can be used to assess individual differences in treatment responsivity. The knowledge and research training gained from this project will prepare the trainee to build and refine interventions to reduce unhealthy eating that will ultimately reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity, and risk for diet-related cancers.",Cancer Prevention through Dietary Change: Training in translational neuroimaging,9756118,F31CA232357,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Health Promotion', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'adult obesity', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenicity', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'control trial', 'cost', 'craving', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'food craving', 'increased appetite', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'open source', 'parent grant', 'post intervention', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2019,39535,-0.033904208730011764
"Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA): Prediction and Prevention Project Summary: The recent advances in information technologies and biotechnologies is an opportunity to substantially improve healthcare. To exploit the power of data to benefit patients, however, effective clinical decision support tools and novel, individualized interventions must be designed, tested, and implemented. Although there has been progress in the development of statistical/machine learning methods, numerous challenges remain to tailor and translate them into useful clinical decision support tools. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) accounts for 15-20% of all adult deaths and is the industrial world’s leading cause of death. Clinical studies of SCA produce repeated measures on risk factors and multiple different kinds of events over time. We refer to these data as survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) data. In this project, we will develop novel statistical learning methods for SLAM data and apply them to two distinct aspects of the SCA problem. First, we propose to develop novel statistical learning algorithms that better predict an individual’s multivariate longitudinal data with a focus on the risk of first and subsequent SCA. Second, we propose to develop micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs to reduce behavioral risk factors for SCA among persons at high risk. The methods that we propose to develop will be applicable in many areas of medicine. However, they are motivated by and applied to SCA in this project. Our team has expertise in statistics including causal inference, longitudinal data and survival analyses, plus machine learning, epidemiology, cardiology, and behavioral interventions through mobile health (mHealth). This proposed collaboration has the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and test statistical learning tools for real-time risk prediction of survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) outcome data. Aim 2: Estimate the risk of SCA and its dependence on dynamic modifiable and non-modifiable factors in population-based and clinical cohorts. Aim 3: Plan and conduct a feasibility-usability study of micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs for behavioral change to reduce SCA risk. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have contributed to the progress of healthcare delivery through the application of computational statistics to medicine. ! ! Project Narrative: Although sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the industrial world’s leading cause of death, SCA prediction and prevention strategies remain limited. In this project, we contribute towards addressing the global burden of SCAs through the development of novel statistical/machine learning methods for SCA risk prediction and the design of mobile health (mHealth) interventions for risk reduction. While developed in the context of SCA, these methods will be applicable in many areas of medicine and public health. !",Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA): Prediction and Prevention,9790928,F30HL142131,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Information Technology', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'adaptive intervention', 'career', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'time use', 'tool', 'trial design', 'usability']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,0.03955801368028107
"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief. These findings may advance understanding of the process of grief, facilitate early identification of high-risk grievers and potentially form the basis for targeted treatment of complicated grief.",Predicting complicated grief from grief processing,9686793,K23MH114021,"['Acute', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Down-Regulation', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Family member', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Guilt', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Reaction Time', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Stimulus', 'Suicide', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Trauma', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intense pain', 'loved ones', 'neural patterning', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'sustained attention', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K23,2019,199800,-0.03500976414125395
"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) is a major concern after ACL reconstruction. This project will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction using a novel combination of mechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics.

"Biomarker Signature to Predict the Persistence of Post-Traumatic Headache ABSTRACT There is currently no recognized way of accurately predicting who will recover from post-traumatic headache (PTH) during the acute phase following concussion and who will go on to develop persistent post-traumatic headache (PPTH), a condition that is difficult to treat effectively. Clinical experience with treating secondary headaches suggests that treatment is most effective when initiated early after headache onset, before headache patterns become persistent. So, why don't clinicians treat all patients with PTH acutely following concussion? Although it is likely to be beneficial to treat those patients who are at high risk for PPTH as early as possible, medication side effects and toxicities make it potentially harmful to administer unnecessary medication to those patients who would recover on their own without treatment. The inability to identify which concussed patients with acute PTH are at high risk for PTH persistence leaves clinicians without the knowledge needed to make informed decisions regarding how aggressive to manage patients with acute PTH. Study Goal: to develop a prognostic biomarker signature for PPTH using clinical data as well as structural and functional brain neuroimaging and to assess the predictive accuracy of an ensemble biomarker signature for the early identification of patients at high risk for PTH persistence. The accurate prediction of individuals who are at high risk for PTH persistence would allow clinicians to recommend early and more aggressive management with the intention of preventing PTH persistence. A predictive model for PPTH could also guide clinical trials that will test the utility of innovative therapies to prevent PPTH by allowing for enrichment of the subject cohort with patients at high risk of PPTH. R61 Phase: During the R61 phase this study will develop brain imaging and clinical feature prognostic biomarker signatures for PPTH using machine-learning algorithms. The imaging and clinical biomarker signatures will be developed by laboratories that will first work in-parallel, and then the laboratories will combine the neuroimaging and clinical biomarkers using an ensemble approach. Results of this study will determine important clinical factors (e.g. demographics, medical history, brain injury characteristics, headache characteristics, speech patterns) and brain imaging markers (e.g. regional volumes, cortical thickness, white matter tract integrity, perfusion, functional connectivity) for predicting PTH persistence Additionally, the predictive weight of specific clinical factors and neuroimaging features for characterizing patients who are at higher risk for developing PPTH will be determined. R33 Phase: Once the predictive weights of clinical factors and neuroimaging features are determined, the clinical testing battery and neuroimaging sequences can be pruned down and optimized to include only those that have high predictive power for PPTH. The scanning sequences used in this study are commonly available MRI sequences, making their use feasible across healthcare centers. This optimized and shortened testing sequence can be translated into clinical practice and integrated into PTH clinical trials for early identification of those individuals who are at high risk for PTH persistence.   Project Narrative: Currently, there are no adequate methods to predict whether an individual with post-traumatic headache (PTH) will have resolution of headaches during the acute phase or will have persistence of PTH (PPTH). The goal of this study is to identify a prognostic biomarker signature that will accurately predict the persistence of PTH using clinical data and structural and functional brain neuroimaging data collected in the semi-acute post-concussion phase. The ability to predict who will develop PPTH would help clinicians determine how aggressively to manage patients with PTH during the acute phase and would allow for optimizing enrollment into PTH clinical trials by preferentially enrolling individuals who are likely to have PTH persistence.  ",Biomarker Signature to Predict the Persistence of Post-Traumatic Headache,9829475,R61NS113315,"['Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Headache', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Headaches', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'demographics', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'sex', 'side effect', 'white matter']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R61,2019,3152333,0.018759056625155573
"Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes Project Summary Motor vehicle crashes lead causes of adolescent mortality, making this a major health threat facing US adolescents. Given that 95.6% of novice driver crashes are due to driver error, improved skill should reduce crash incidence. Research supports this: novice driver crash rates peak immediately following licensure and decline steeply with experience gained over the months following licensure. However, it is not known which critical driving skill deficits present at licensure predict crashes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop interventions prior to licensure that can lead to the safest independent driving post licensure. With this R21 project, we will identify deficits in driving skills that are (a) associated with major predictors of early crash risk (age at licensure and sex) and that (b) can predict differences in crash rates within the first year of independent licensure. We will leverage our exclusive access to an innovative, newly available data source for young driver research. To enable study of safety critical driving skill deficits in novice drivers, results from a new (as of July 2017) virtual driving test (VDT) - developed by the PI, adopted by the State of Ohio and delivered immediately prior to the on-road licensing examination - will be linked to Ohio licensing and crash data. We propose these aims: Aim 1: identify skill clusters using multivariate clustering, regression and machine learning techniques to test the hypothesis that these clusters are related to age at licensure, sex, and time spent in the learner period; Aim 2a: use data on driving skills linked with reported crash data in Ohio to determine whether the skill clusters identified in Aim 1 are associated with crash risk; and Aim 2b: determine if those skill clusters from Aim1 are predictive of crashes in rural teen drivers. With a large sample of new driver applicants (>25,000), this study will examine, for the first time, differences in skill, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will create a normative dataset of novice driver skills; classify skill deficits by age, sex and time in learner period; and quantify the relationship between skill deficits and crash rates during the first 2 months of licensure (when crash rates are highest for young drivers) and the following 10 months as experience accumulates. If the use of the VDT proves successful in predicting crash risk, we will be able to identify novice drivers with elevated crash risk before granting a license. This R21 will enable the following lines of research: (1) Develop new interventions that address skill deficits through training, individualized to the needs of the novice driver (in partnership with Ohio). (2) Develop or adapt advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or self-driving vehicle technology to mitigate identified skill deficits (as part of Dr. Winston’s National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center). (3) Conduct a prospective study (R01) of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk. Narrative We will identify safety-critical driving skill deficits immediately prior to licensure that predict crashes, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will leverage exclusive access to newly available data on >25,000 novice drivers: state licensing and crash data linked to results from a new (as of July 2017), well-validated virtual driving test that identifies driving skill deficits (adopted by Ohio). If this R21 finds the VDT successful in predicting crash risk, we plan to: (1) conduct a future study of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk and (2) develop new interventions (training and vehicle technology) to address this risk.","Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes",9808966,R21HD099635,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industry', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Licensure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Police', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vehicle crash', 'Young driver', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'design', 'driving skills', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prospective', 'safety study', 'sex', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suburb', 'virtual']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2019,294653,0.026133596613904058

"A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors PROJECT ABSTRACT Advances in acute care have decreased short-term mortality of sepsis, resulting in an increasing number of survivors who experience significant morbidity and mortality. Recurrent infections account for 60% of hospital readmissions after sepsis and are an important cause of long-term mortality. Identifying sepsis survivors at risk for infections and understanding predisposing factors are therefore important first steps to develop personalized interventions to improve long-term outcomes. The overall research goal is to develop innovative targeted interventions to improve long-term outcomes after sepsis. This proposal focuses on identifying subgroups of sepsis survivors (phenotypes) at high risk for infection-related hospital readmissions and deaths. It is hypothesized that the combination of host factors, disease characteristics, and interventions prior to and during sepsis will identify distinct phenotypes that are captured by clinical data. These clinical phenotypes likely have distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms (e.g., immunosuppression), predispose to different outcomes (e.g., recurrent infections), and patients with the same phenotype may respond similarly to targeted interventions such as immunomodulation. In Aim 1, three nationally representative datasets of sepsis survivors will be assembled and analyzed by machine learning techniques to identify valid clinical sepsis phenotypes. In Aim 2, phenotypes at high-risk for infection-related readmissions and deaths at 6 months will be identified, and underlying biomarker profiles for these phenotypes analyzed. In Aim 3, these high-risk phenotypes will be used to conceptualize and simulate an adaptive platform trial designed to test the efficacy of three different immunomodulatory drugs. An adaptive trial design was chosen, because it can test multiple interventions simultaneously and reduces the chances of exposing patients to ineffective or harmful interventions. The research plan is augmented by expert mentoring and rigorous didactic training. Together, this will provide the candidate with essential career development skills in the science of precision medicine, including machine learning methodologies, Bayesian statistics, and innovate clinical trial design. This proposal has potentially groundbreaking implications for the future treatment of sepsis survivors, because it deviates from the current “one-size fits all” approach and attempts to create the framework for personalized interventions. This framework sets the stage for future independent investigator (RO1) applications evaluating personalized treatments in adaptive clinical trials, and will uniquely position the candidate as a future leader in the field of long-term outcomes after critical illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is important for public health because sepsis is a life-threatening infection that affects 30 million people worldwide each year. Long-term outcomes for patients who survive a hospital admission for sepsis are poor, and many patients develop new disabilities or worsening of preexisting health conditions. This proposal supports the NIH’s mission to enhance health and reduce illness and disability by trying to identify interventions for sepsis survivors at highest risk for poor outcomes.",A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors,9718511,K23GM132688,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Interleukin-7', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'PDCD1LG1 gene', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Recombinants', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Sepsis', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'trial design']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2019,189327,0.020466388700405982
"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack.

"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and associated with significant impairment and mortality. Rates of depression begin to rise rapidly in early-mid adolescence and peak in early adulthood.

"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",9903905,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Appalachia', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'sociodemographics', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2019,418818,-0.01632931682354043
"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project focuses on human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife, with an emphasis on factors that moderate and mediate brain-to- risk relationships. The Program Project applies integrative, multi-level and multi-method approaches in community samples of midlife men and women to understand brain phenotypes for CVD risk.

"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Title: Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Project Summary  Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. Risk assessment of influenza viruses is a key component in pandemic influenza preparedness (PIP), and it can help optimize resources for influenza surveillance, vaccine development and other control measurements to help minimize losses due to an emerging influenza virus. Risk assessment of influenza viruses includes emergence risk and public health impact of novel influenza viruses. Emergence risk assesses the probability for a novel influenza virus to infect and easily spread among humans; it is the first risk to be evaluated in risk assessment.  Although a number of individual mutations or structural/functional motifs have been reported to be associated with influenza infection and transmission, their effects on emergence risk are difficult to predict a priori. Thus, conventional methods for assessment of the emergence risk of a novel IAV often require laboratory generation of reassortants and subsequent measurement of their infectivity, pathogenesis, and transmission, which is often done in a mammalian system. However, this strategy can lead to laboratory mutants with gain of function (i.e., mutants with new or enhanced activity on pathogenesis and/or transmissibility in mammals). Thus, an ideal system for influenza risk assessment should be able to quantify emergence risk for a novel IAV solely by using genomic sequences.  Avian influenza A viruses facilitated the emergence of all four known pandemic human influenza A viruses: the hemagglutinin genes of 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemic viruses are all of avian origin, and the polymerase PB2 and PA genes of the 2009 pandemic virus are of avian origin. Risk assessment of potential reassortants from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses has been a key component of the pandemic influenza preparedness process.  The objectives of this study are to develop and validate a machine learning method to assess the emergence risk for a novel IAV using genomic sequences. The study will focus on emergence risk from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses. We expect to identify genetic features within and across gene segments and ascertain their synergistic effects as emergence risk determinants. We also expect to develop a computational model for estimating the probability of a possible reassortant to emerge, given the genomic sequences of one human influenza virus and one avian influenza virus. The study results should help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and with assessing emergence risk of influenza virus; thus, the results should facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness. Project Narrative This project will develop a computational model for influenza risk assessment, and it will help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and for assessing the emergence risk of influenza viruses, and thus the project will facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness.",Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses,9693661,R21AI135820,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Birds', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Funding', 'Gene Combinations', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Information Theory', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Reassortant Viruses', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'cost', 'enzootic', 'flu transmission', 'gain of function', 'genetic variant', 'in vivo', 'influenza surveillance', 'influenzavirus', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'pandemic influenza', 'transmission process', 'vaccine development', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,5173,0.038774862204128145
"Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches Project Summary  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, affecting every 200-1000 people, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria. FH leads to lifetime raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a high risk for premature atherosclerosis and downstream coronary heart disease. FH is designated as Tier 1 disease by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, notably one of only three such diseases, because it is common, is associated with a high risk of premature illness, and is treatable with lifestyle or medications. Great uncertainty exists about the optimal approach to FH screening, which is reflected in conflicting recommendations in national screening guidelines.  We propose to synthesize high quality data from national surveys and population-based cohort studies in a health policy computer simulation model comparing the health and economic value of different FH screening strategies. This study will prioritize the optimal approaches to FH screening in the U.S. population, identifying optimal initial screening age and defining the role of genetic testing in screening.  We have assembled a team of experts in pediatric preventive cardiology, decision analysis, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, population genetics, biostatistics, health economic evaluation, and computer simulation modeling in order to evaluate and compare different FH screening strategies in children and adults. We aim to use this expertise and these methods in order to:   Quantify diagnostic yield, clinical effectiveness, and economic value of universal FH phenotype  screening in childhood or adulthood, and the added value of FH genotype screening   Compare universal FH screening to the alternatives of using family history or a Big Data-based  algorithm to direct targeted screening limited to children and adults with possible FH diagnosis   Quantify the health and economic value of cascade screening families of FH cases  We hypothesize that FH screening in childhood will be the highest value screening strategy in the U.S. population, and that genetic testing will improve diagnosis and treatment decisions most in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., borderline high cholesterol or absent family history). We hypothesize that a machine-learning algorithm will avoid the costs and complexity of universal screening, while yielding a similar case yield, as long as cholesterol testing is sufficiently common in children.  This study will identify the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population and the most influential data based on current knowledge and set the stage for efficiently designed clinical trials of FH screening. This study will be a test case for the concept of a “precision” population health approach to screening for genetically-determined diseases in the general population. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by lifetime elevated cholesterol, which, if uncontrolled, is associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conflicting current national guidelines highlight that the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population is controversial: it is unclear if screening should start in childhood or adulthood, or if it should include genetic testing. We propose to synthesize data from national surveys, high quality cohort studies, and clinical trials of cholesterol lowering interventions in a lifetime cardiovascular disease risk computer simulation model to project the life time health impact of different FH screening approaches and identify optimal screening strategies in children and adults.","Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches",9661259,R01HL141823,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coronary heart disease', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Decision Analysis', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Policy', 'Hepatocyte', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Low Prevalence', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proxy', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'economic evaluation', 'economic value', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'pediatric patients', 'population based', 'population health', 'premature', 'premature atherosclerosis', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,894544,0.0044127565032547715
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9988737,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,544562,0.03331554683564096
"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser.

"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.","Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies",9709183,R01AA024391,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dependence', 'Distal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Heart Rate', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol involvement', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'care systems', 'clinical application', 'coping', 'cost', 'craving', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'model development', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized care', 'prevent', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'real time model', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'relative cost', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'sensor', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'stressor', 'wearable device']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,381816,-0.025486330897025972
"Developing a Pediatric Readmission (PERE) Risk Prediction Tool for Decision Support During Pre-Discharge Planning Project Summary/Abstract Pediatric Potentially Preventable Readmissions (“PPRs”) take a toll on the quality of life of young patients and their families and also place extra strain on health care systems that care for children. Accurate readmission risk prediction algorithms can aid clinicians in identifying patients most at risk for PPRs and thereby facilitate improved identification of patients most in need of more intensive discharge planning. Such focused risk assessments help with allocation of staffing and resources. Unfortunately, existing PPR risk predictions rarely explicitly consider pediatric patients and are not highly accurate. With recent advances in machine learning and deep learning, assessment of a large range of risk factors for pediatric PPRs is possible. To that end, our primary objective is to develop a suite of Pediatric Readmission (“PERE”) risk prediction algorithms to predict risk of a PPR within three (3), seven (7), and thirty (30) days of discharge from a child’s current inpatient stay. We will do this by leveraging recent advances in statistical data science algorithms. We will also develop PERE predictions such that they can be used to assess risk for PPRs prior to and during the discharge planning phases of a patient’s current inpatient stay. In environments of limited staffing and resources, the PERE risk prediction suite will support clinicians with a means of identifying patients most at risk for PPRs who may be candidates for increased discharge planning related care. Relevance We will focus our PERE risk prediction efforts on an AHRQ priority population: Children. Children represent a vulnerable population due to their developing physiology, limited communication abilities, and reliance on a caregiver to appropriately understand instructions and administer care after discharge.1,2 Early identification of risk for PPRs in three (3), seven (7), and thirty (30) days in this vulnerable population will alert hospital nurses and care managers of the increased risk a particular patient may face that can be more fully attended to during discharge planning. By using deep-learning and other emerging machine learning methods to optimize risk prediction, this proposal also supports AHRQ’s mission to harness data and technology to improve health care quality and patient outcomes and to facilitate improved measurement, monitoring, and surveillance of patient risk. This technology will be implemented using data from a very large pediatric patient care database to develop and validate PERE risk predictions. Project Narrative Pediatric discharge planning benefits from understanding which patients are most at risk for Potentially Preventable Readmissions (“PPRs”). This study will use the Children's Hospital Association's Pediatric Health Information System and machine learning to produce a Pediatric Readmission (“PERE”) suite of risk prediction tools appropriate for use at the outset and during discharge planning across a range of hospital IT support infrastructures.",Developing a Pediatric Readmission (PERE) Risk Prediction Tool for Decision Support During Pre-Discharge Planning,9808871,R03HS027024,[' '],AHRQ,VARIETY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R03,2019,51077,0.03116654376379553
"Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes Summary The objective of this proposal is to optimize the design and evaluate a robust artificial pancreas (R-AP) system for use in patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (T1D) with HbA1C greater than 8% and compare HbA1C outcomes in these patients relative to a decision support system that utilizes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. Although high risk patients have possibly the most to gain from usage of AP technology, they are oftentimes under-represented or excluded from clinical trials. This has been because of the increased risk of failure of these AP systems that were not designed to handle inconsistent reporting of meals, variable activity level, and infusion set failures. An AP system for high risk patients needs to be designed to achieve maximal benefit, including reducing the risk of acute and chronic complications. A major obstacle for enabling the AP for usage by high-risk patients is that these patients may be less compliant with use guidelines for the system including missed meal announcements, infrequent sensor calibrations, and prolonged infusion set wear leading to infusion set failures. In this grant, we will integrate new risk-mitigation features into the OHSU single-hormone AP to enable usage by high-risk patients that fall into the categories described above. We present new algorithms for automating the detection of missed meal announcements, missed calibrations, and robust handling of hybrid usage mode. While AP systems may be an optimal choice for improving glycemic control, many people with T1D prefer MDI therapy. Decision support systems such as the DailyDose decision support system developed at OHSU can be used to improve glycemic control for patients who prefer MDI therapy. The DailyDose decision support system is designed for CGM augmented MDI therapy. It enables on-demand calculation of insulin doses, automates insulin dose adjustments based on pattern recognition, and uses machine learning approaches to alert the patients to events such as predicted hypoglycemia and missed meal doses.The benefit of the DailyDose system is that it is a simple system and does not require use of an insulin pump, which may be a challenge for some patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes as pump therapy is more intensive and requires infusion set changes. It is unknown in this high risk group of people whether patient needs, quality of life, and glycemic control are best addressed with an AP system or decision support tool or if both treatments are appropriate. We have designed a 3-month clinical study to compare glycemic outcomes during AP vs. decision support interventions in a high- risk T1D cohort (HbA1C 8-10.5%), with the aim of demonstrating a significant clinically relevant reduction in HbA1C. Our hypothesis is that both AP and decision support therapies will decrease HbA1C relative to baseline but that the AP will provide further benefit over DailyDose. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. We propose to integrate features into the OHSU artificial pancreas to optimize it for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c>8-10.5%) and compare it to DailyDose, a decision support system that uses multiple daily injections.",Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes,9789266,R01DK120367,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Carbohydrates', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Distress', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modification', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'design', 'engineering design', 'expectation', 'falls', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'patient population', 'primary outcome', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'risk mitigation', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'support tools']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,621247,0.017736258519430035
"LEVERAGING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITHIN SOCIAL NETWORKS TO MAXIMIZE DRUG ANDALCOHOL TREATMENT EFFICACY AND RELAPSE PREVENTION PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sober Grid™ has developed a smartphone-based mobile application currently in use by over 120,000 individuals worldwide who are in, or seeking, recovery from drug and alcohol addiction. The “Grid”, as it is known, is a mobile-based, social recovery community providing rapid context- specific peer support, efficient help seeking, motivational enhancement exercises, and member ratings of support content – all aimed to prevent relapse. The overarching goal of this phase II project is to extend the current capabilities of the Sober Grid app to achieve a comprehensive social recovery support app featuring intelligent, context appropriate resource matching and 24/7 rapid response peer-coaching that is effective in reducing disordered substance use and is cost effective. We hypothesize that providing this functionality to high-risk members will be acceptable, feasible, increase access to and engagement with resources, and have a positive effect in increasing time to relapse and days of consecutive abstinence. The company’s priority commercial goal is to leverage the insights gained from its large database of information and behaviors recorded in its existing addiction recovery-focused social network, combined with its recently completed SBIR phase I work, to identify users at risk for relapse and deliver tailored lay and professional peer support, telehealth, and provider interventions prompted by near real-time automated risk indicators built into an Enhanced Sober Grid (ESG) solution. The specific goals of this proposed phase II project include: (1) implementing the relapse risk scoring algorithm successfully developed in phase I in a production environment, (2) developing a ML resource relevancy matching algorithm, and (3) using this system to pilot test the feasibility and acceptability as well as to estimate the effect on abstinence of providing peer-coaching and resource information to a national sample of Sober Grid members in recovery from non- alcohol/nicotine substances who are predicted to be at high risk for relapse. We will accomplish our objectives by: (Aim 1) Implementing an accurate, near real-time production risk prediction system; (Aim 2) Developing an enhanced, in-app substance-addiction recovery resource locator; and, (Aim 3) Determining the feasibility, acceptability and estimating the effect size of the proposed ESG among high relapse-risk participants in recovery from opioid, stimulant, or cannabis use. The expected impact of this project is to substantially enhance Sober Grid's ability to deliver effective and timely interventions to the right individuals, at the right time – including those high-need and underserved populations that would otherwise lack access to care and draw considerable resources from the healthcare system. This capability holds the promise to reduce drug and alcohol relapse and the associated negative health impacts at both an individual and societal level while reducing the total cost of providing treatment services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sober Grid is combining near real-time risk prediction with automated phone-app messaging, peer-coaching, and resource visibility and transparency in order to dramatically improve support for recovery from substance abuse. The strategy is to provide continuously available responsive connection and support with simple and familiar ways to search, filter, sort, identify, and review/rate resource options in order to lower overall relapse rates within the population, enabling Sober Grid users to achieve improved health outcomes and institutional payers to reduce the total cost of achieving those outcomes. Over time, the innovations resulting from this project will significantly reduce costs for individuals, public and private payers, the healthcare system, and society at large.",LEVERAGING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITHIN SOCIAL NETWORKS TO MAXIMIZE DRUG ANDALCOHOL TREATMENT EFFICACY AND RELAPSE PREVENTION,9681118,R44DA044062,"['Abstinence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Android', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug usage', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality Traits', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Published Comment', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Stream', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Underserved Population', 'Work', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'alcohol relapse', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'drug relapse', 'effective therapy', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'marijuana use', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'member', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'peer', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'phase 2 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'prevent', 'provider intervention', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sobriety', 'social', 'social media', 'stimulant use', 'success', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services']",NIDA,"SOBER GRID, INC.",R44,2019,499907,-0.013750769864800704
"Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark's population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation. This will inform the development of interventions to address the neighborhood factors that affect Alzheimer's disease.",Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors,9745267,R01AG063385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Attention', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Blood Vessels', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Experience', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Minority Groups', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Refugees', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Social Sciences', 'Socialization', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Violence', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical development', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'deprivation', 'diabetes risk', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'residence', 'response', 'social', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'treatment effect', 'vascular risk factor', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,567836,0.03141288434376932
"Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Strom received an MD from Harvard Medical School (HMS), and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (BIDMC), and non-invasive cardiac imaging (BIDMC). Additionally, he completed an MSc in Epidemiology program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in May, 2018. He is now a junior faculty member at BIDMC with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. Through this proposed 5-year program, Dr. Strom will pursue additional training in advanced prediction modeling, machine learning, patient-oriented research, and metabolomics. The candidate’s long- term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the area of applied outcomes research. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Robert W. Yeh (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Director of the Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology, Robert E. Gerszten (Co-Mentor), Professor of Medicine at HMS and Chief of Cardiovascular Medicine at BIDMC, and Changyu Shen (Co-Mentor), upcoming Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Lead Biostatistician for the Smith Center. Dr. Yeh has a track record of leading practice-changing studies and successful mentorship of clinician investigators. Dr. Gerszten is an internationally recognized expert in molecular phenotyping of cardiovascular diseases using metabolomics and proteomics and has mentored several K-award and R01 funded clinical investigators. Dr. Shen has a long track record of NIH funding, expertise in evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effect in cardiovascular diseases, and has mentored multiple prior trainees. Research: The optimal therapy for a given individual with aortic stenosis remains uncertain. This proposal seeks to define the clinical and biologic components of frailty that modify risk after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and alter treatment benefit. For Aims 1-2, we will leverage the unique linkage of Medicare data to the US CoreValve Pivotal trials, a collection of clinical trials that randomized individuals with severe aortic stenosis to transcatheter AVR (TAVR) with a self-expanding bioprosthesis vs. surgical AVR (SAVR). In Aim 1, we will we will identify which variables, related to in-person assessments of frailty and candidate frailty codes, best predict adverse outcomes after AVR. In Aim 2, we will identify if novel variables identified in Aim 1, identify a heterogeneous treatment response in individuals undergoing AVR. In Aim 3, we will prospectively enroll patients undergoing TAVR at BIDMC with concurrent frailty phenotyping to identify whether metabolites associated with longevity correlate with frailty and predict adverse outcomes, independent of age and comorbidities. The research will identify the mechanisms by which frailty confers adverse risk and differential treatment benefit in AVR, providing insights that may personalize treatment selection and improve patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE While new technologies have permitted the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis, which is fatal without treatment, deciding on the optimal treatment for a given patient is often difficult, especially as these decisions are often made towards the end of life and there are significant risks concomitant with each treatment. In this setting, frailty, a state of debility that impairs recovery from illness, has emerged as a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes but the mechanisms by which frailty confers risk and the components of frailty that are most important are unknown. In this proposal, we seek to define the clinical and biological components of frailty that contribute risk in aortic valve replacement using a combination of novel data sources and methodologic techniques, including linkage of clinical trials to administrative data, machine learning, and metabolite profiling, in order to personalize treatments and optimize patient health and medical decision making.",Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling,9821515,K23HL144907,"['Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bioprosthesis device', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronology', 'Citric Acid Cycle', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Israel', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physician Executives', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'aortic valve replacement', 'base', 'end of life', 'frailty', 'health data', 'health service use', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'mid-career faculty', 'minimally invasive', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'surgical risk', 'treatment effect', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2019,172800,0.012257721904684143
"Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT [ Pediatric specialists are often required to identify infants who are likely to suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcome, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is the most common developmental disability among children in the United States and results from several factors, including low weight for gestational age, premature birth, and stroke. Although MRI and cranial ultrasound (cUS) provide valuable structural information in the preterm period, they have moderate sensitivity to CP and require transportation of the infant. Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have validated the clinical potential of General Movement Assessment (GMA) for CP risk identification. During the early period, (23 weeks to 36 weeks gestational age), the presence of Cramped Synchronized General Movements (CSGMs), has demonstrated very high sensitivity and specificity for CP, conjointly ranging from 80%-98%. CSGMs are assessed while preterm infants are still in an acute care facility (NICU) and can inform the clinician independently, and in combination with cUS and MRI. Despite its potential, GMA is available in only a few clinical centers, as adoption and routine application depend on lengthy, cost-intensive observation and availability of specially trained raters. A Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) is proposed that will automate GMA for bedside evaluations in both preterm and postterm periods. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology not only for routine risk identification, but also for establishing disease trajectory and potentially differentiating CP subtypes and assessing efficacy of emerging treatments along the early developmental continuum.  Preliminary studies at UC Irvine have demonstrated that GMA analysis for CSGMs can be automated by quantifying infant limb movement using highly miniaturized, 3-axis wireless accelerometers and classifying CSGMs using a patented Markov-type approach that merges an application-specific Erlang-Cox state transition model with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (“EC-DBN”), treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling CSGM (and non-CSGM) duration and interval. In Phase I, this approach will be utilized in a comparative evaluation of two movement measurement modalities to determine which has the best overall performance and clinical utility at three leading NICU centers. Infant movement data will be concurrently acquired using an advanced, second generation prototype wireless accelerometer system (CPRIS-A) and a high definition 3D (infrared) optical camera (CPRIS-O). The optical modality offers significant potential advantages as it requires no infant contact and can monitor unattended, intermittently, over weeks or months. However, its potential for GMA automation must be systematically evaluated. Classifier results from both modalities will be compared to expert rater consensus in 80 preterm infants. The primary outcome will be CSGM identification accuracy, as determined by ROC-AUC analyses, with a threshold for success of 0.85. Additional comparative performance measures include reliability and practicability in the NICU environment. An Advisory Committee of experts in the fields of neonatology, pediatrics and cerebral palsy will evaluate project results and advise on the clinical potential of each modality. ] PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood, with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per 1000 in high-income countries. The overall project goal is to develop a computerized hardware-software system capable of identifying preterm infants at high risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP), based on the systematic identification of specific patterns of movement-derived features. The Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) will enable clinical staff with only minimal training to cost effectively implement General Movement Assessment (GMA) for Cramped Synchronous General Movements (CSGMs), with interpretive reporting performed automatically. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology for advancement in the identification, characterization and treatment assessment of CP.",Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System,9769890,R43NS098840,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Budgets', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Compromising', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Muscle Cramp', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neonatology', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'comparative', 'computerized', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'critical period', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'digital', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'heuristics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'limb movement', 'miniaturize', 'new technology', 'off-patent', 'perinatal brain', 'postnatal period', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'wireless communication']",NINDS,"NEUROCOMP SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2019,261076,0.012250846138441263
"Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities Project Summary/Abstract From 2000-2014, hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, incidence rates increased nearly 4% per year, while most cancers in the United States were on the decline. HCC disproportionately impacts minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. To inform primary prevention strategies that will reduce disparities in HCC risk, we need to determine the relative contribution of well- established and emerging (e.g., hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, alcohol, smoking, cirrhosis, NAFLD, metabolic disorders, diabetes, HIV infection), and novel (e.g., medications, comorbidities, neighborhood attributes) risk factors to these disparities. To inform secondary and tertiary prevention strategies to reduce disparities in HCC burden, we need to understand the multilevel factors that contribute to HCC surveillance disparities. Answering these gaps in knowledge requires a robust high-quality study with a sample enriched for racial/ethnic minorities. Thus, we propose to leverage existing multi-disciplinary collaborations to develop an integrated dataset that includes electronic health records (EHR) data linked to population-based state cancer registry data and geospatial contextual data. This multilevel resource will include data on nearly 2.3 million individuals from three healthcare systems (mixed payer, integrated healthcare, federally qualified health centers) in California and Hawaii, thus providing diversity in healthcare settings and enrichment for racial/ethnic minorities: 59,400 are Black, 189,500 are Hispanic, and 441,700 are Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI). With this resource, we specifically aim to: (1) assess the relative importance of established and emerging examine the extent to which these factors independently and jointly contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk; (2) discover novel risk factors and assess their relative importance to HCC risk; and (3) assess racial/ethnic disparities in adherence with surveillance for HCC as well as examine the extent to which these disparities are attributable to modifiable individual-, clinician-, system-, and neighborhood factors (Aim 3). For Aim 1, using prospective data, we will assess the relative importance of risk factors and their contribution to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk with causal inference methods. For Aim 2, we will apply innovative machine learning methods to identify novel factors and validate their associations with HCC risk using modeling strategy from Aim 1. For Aim 3, we will use multilevel generalized linear regression to investigate the patient, clinician, institutional and geographic factors that contribute to disparities in HCC surveillance. Given the importance of sex and age/birth cohort for HCC risk, these social determinants will be considered together with race/ethnicity using an intersectional approach. By applying a multilevel framework to understand how biological, clinical, and social factors at multiple levels contribute to HCC disparities in incidence and surveillance, the proposed study will identify modifiable factors that can be translated to the clinical and community settings to collaboratively identify strategies to ameliorate racial/ethnic disparities in HCC. Project Narrative While most cancer incidence and mortality in the United States are declining, the burden of liver cancer is increasing; yet, we do not understand what causes 40% of these cancers. Furthermore, this cancer impacts racial/ethnic groups disproportionately, with minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. Therefore we propose to study the relative contribution of established and emerging risk factors, discover and validate novel risk factors, and to understand patient, clinician, healthcare system and geographic factors that influence surveillance; these findings can then be used to inform strategies in clinical and community settings to reduce the burden of liver cancer particularly for those at high risk.",Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities,9679122,R01CA225478,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Alcohols', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'HIV Infections', 'Hawaii', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Maintenance Organizations', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive measure', 'Primary Prevention', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'built environment', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer health disparity', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'data registry', 'disparity reduction', 'electronic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'intersectionality', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'sex', 'social', 'social disparities', 'socioeconomics', 'tertiary prevention']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,680549,0.03444266042957006
"Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions Project Summary/Abstract Atrial Fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and accounts for roughly 15% of all strokes in the United States. Many individuals may have undiagnosed AF whose arrhythmia does not prompt evaluation either because of minimal symptoms or brief episodes. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is highly effective at reducing stroke risk in patients with AF, but is only prescribed to individuals with recognized disease. Identifying subjects with undiagnosed AF is important so they may be treated with OAC and prevent strokes from occurring. This project will help advance our knowledge of screening patients for undiagnosed AF in the primary care setting by identifying patients at high risk of developing AF for targeted clinic and home-based screening strategies. Fundamental questions of who to target and how to implement a screening program in the United States remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic and content area training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To identify predictors of AF incidence from electronic health record structured and free-text data, 2) To develop and implement an electronic algorithm that improves upon existing models to identify patients at increased risk for AF in a primary care population, and 3) To implement and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of a clinic and home-based screening program to identify undiagnosed AF. This project aligns with several objectives of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Strategic Vision by implementing novel diagnostic tools to diagnose AF and prevent strokes, by optimizing clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease, and leveraging emerging opportunities in data science, through the use of natural language processing of text data in the electronic health record, to improve identification of patients at high risk for AF. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in cardiovascular disease and targeting populations for prevention of cardiovascular disease events. Career development activities include training in biomedical informatics, data mining and risk prediction, survey research design, implementation research, and cardiovascular disease pathophysiology and clinical management through formal coursework, clinical shadowing, as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will improve prediction of which patients are at the highest risk of developing AF, and evaluate how to use this risk information to implement an effective screening strategy in primary care. Pilot data from this award will lay the groundwork for a highly competitive application for NIH R01 funding. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke and the prevalence is estimated to increase from 5.2 million adults in the United States to more than 12 million by 2030, however, many additional individuals have undiagnosed disease. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, by 1) improving identification of patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation, and 2) targeting patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation in the primary care setting with an efficient strategy for clinic and home-based screening. This program will significantly increase knowledge of how to overcome the real-world issue of how to effectively and efficiently screen for atrial fibrillation in clinical practice.",Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions,9806592,K01HL148506,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Senior Scientist', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data registry', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient screening', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk minimization', 'screening', 'screening program', 'stroke risk', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2019,176990,0.016917410726098234
"The CRIT-ICU Biomarker Panel for Stratification of Mortality Risk in ARDS Patients PROJECT SUMMARY: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastatingly intense lung inflammatory disorder that annually afflicts more than 1 million individuals world-wide (200,000 cases/year in the U.S.) with an unacceptable mortality rate of 30-40%. Substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity within ARDS phenotypes has greatly impeded therapeutic developments to reduce mortality. All therapies currently employed in ARDS management are ge- neric. The critical care community suffers from a lack of tools that allow identification of ARDS sub-phenotypes and individuals most likely to benefit from novel therapies. Recently, the hyperinflammatory and low inflammatory ARDS sub-phenotypes were identified that markedly differ in natural histories, clinical and biological character- istics, biomarker profiles, responses to positive end-expiratory pressure, ventilator- and organ failure-free days and mortality. ARDS severity (PaO2/FiO2 ratio), the severity of renal or hepatic failure, or the extent of leukocy- tosis failed to distinguish the two phenotypes. As the mortality of the hyperinflammatory phenotype is 3-5 times greater than low inflammatory phenotype, this Phase I STTR will leverage substantial complementary expertise to: i) establish a novel panel of ARDS biomarkers (CRIT-ICU Panel) that stratifies subjects at risk for ARDS into high and low mortality sub-phenotypes; and ii) develop a quantitative platform to allow assessment of these validated biomarkers upon patient entry into the ER or ICU. Our preliminary biomarker data are strong and include 11 ARDS-relevant plasma biomarkers in >250 well-phenotyped ARDS subjects and 70 controls. The targeted biomarkers include cytokine-chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1b, IL-RA), dual-functioning cytozymes i.e. cy- tokine/intracellular enzymes (macrophage migration inhibitory factor, NAMPT), vascular injury markers (VEGF- A, S1PR3, angiopoietin 2), and the advanced glycosylation end product pathway (HMGB1, soluble RAGE). Spe- cific Aim #1 will apply standard biostatistical approaches as well as novel neural network artificial intelligence analysis of this existing dataset to identify an optimal plasma-derived CRIT-ICU Panel which predicts ICU mor- tality in patients with sepsis or trauma who are at risk for development of respiratory failure and ARDS. Specific Aim #2 will develop an optimized and highly standardized Predictive Platform for the CRIT-ICU biomarkers iden- tified to be used in the clinical care setting. Finally, Specific Aim #3 will conduct retrospective validation studies of the optimized CRIT-ICU Panel in biobanked samples from 2 large cohorts: an emergency room-ARDS cohort (PETAL Clinical Network, n=800) and a Spanish sepsis-ARDS cohort (n=200). We speculate that unique exper- tise within Aqualung Therapeutics Corp., PAI Life Sciences Inc., InBios International Inc. and the University of Arizona Health Sciences will drive future prospective validation of the CRIT-ICU Panel in patients at risk for ARDS (Phase II STTR) and lead to development of a true Point of Care test to accelerate clinical trial stratification strategies, and development of innovative ARDS therapeutics to reduce mortality in this devastating syndrome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastatingly intense lung inflammatory disorder that afflicts more than 1 million individuals world-wide each year (200,000 cases/year in the U.S.) with an unacceptable mortality rate of 30-40%. The tremendous heterogeneity of ARDS has greatly impeded therapeutic developments to address ARDS mortality and all therapies currently employed in ARDS management are generic. The critical care community suffers from a lack of empirical data and tools that would allow identification of ARDS sub- phenotypes and potentially identify individuals most likely to benefit from novel therapies. This Phase I STTR leverages substantial complementary expertise to establish a novel panel of ARDS biomarkers (CRIT-ICU Panel) that will be used to stratify subjects at risk for ARDS into high and low mortality sub-phenotypes and develop a predictive platform to allow assessment of these validated biomarkers upon entry into the ER or ICU.

"SCH: Prediction of Preterm Birth in Nulliparous Women Preterm Birth (PTB) is a major long-lasting public health problem being the leading cause of mortality and long-term disabilities among neonates, with heavy emotional and financial consequences to families and society. Prediction of PTB risk has been an exceedingly challenging problem, in particular for first time mothers (nulliparous women) due to the lack of prior pregnancy history. Most studies to date have examined individual risk factors, genetic, environmental, or behavioral, through univariate analyses of their association with PTB, including GWAS identifying modest contribution of common variants across six gene regions. The challenge of improving PTB prediction is due to the inherent complexity of its multifactorial etiology and the lack of approaches capable of integrating and interpreting large multidisciplinary data. Our previous work [NSF Eager 1454855, 1454814] developed predictive models for PTB based on non-genetic maternal attributes. An important question is to know whether factors other than history of PTB can be used to identify a nullipara patient at risk. We plan on devising longitudinal risk prediction methods for PTB that integrate every piece of available data. We will address three important gaps in current literature as our three project objectives: a focused study of nulliparous women and their risk for PTB; combining genetic factors with other clinical factors to determine risk ; and using longitudinal data and models to optimize scheduling of patient visits, testing and treatment. We will focus on a recently released NIH-NICHD dataset called nuMoM2b, which is a prospective cohort study of a racially/ethnically/geographically diverse  population of10 ,038 nulliparous women with singleton gestation . Our aims are as follows: (1) Longitudinal Preterm Birth Prediction ; (2) Combining clinical and genetic features for risk prediction ; (3) Assessing the effectiveness of the methods in clinical practice. RELEVANCE (See instructions) . Over 26 billion dollars are spent annually on the delivery and care of the 12% of infants who are born preterm in the United States. A crucial challenge is to identify women who are at the highest risk for early preterm birth and to develop interventions. Equally important, would be the ability to identify women at the lowest risk to avoid unnecessary and costly interventions. Our project has the potential to advance knowledge about this long-lasting public health problem. n/a",SCH: Prediction of Preterm Birth in Nulliparous Women,9928205,R01LM013327,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Female', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'New York', 'Nulliparity', 'Paper', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Premature Birth', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Social Impacts', 'Societies', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'disability', 'genetic association', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'minority student', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'non-genetic', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'symposium', 'undergraduate research']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2019,259112,0.026334980695713227
"Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT The purpose of this K07 proposal is to provide Jeffrey Lee, MD, MAS with the protected time and resources to pursue the additional training needed to reach his long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator, focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality for CRC. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps (adenomas) and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. With limited data available in the literature to determine the appropriate timing and frequency of follow-up colonoscopy for patients after adenoma removal, recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance from our national guidelines have been imprecise at best. For example, the currently recommended range of 5-10 years for a surveillance colonoscopy for patients with a single adenoma covers a two-fold difference in exam frequency, with resultant two-fold impact on patient risk, cost, and colonoscopy capacity. To help optimize the timing of colonoscopic surveillance and guide appropriate utilization of this invasive and costly resource, stratification of CRC risk after colonoscopic polypectomy from a large community-based cohort with long-term follow-up is needed. Building on his prior work in CRC screening, Dr. Lee seeks to fill this knowledge gap by optimizing surveillance practices in post-polypectomy patients according to patient-, polyp-, and colonoscopy exam-related factors. Specifically, he will determine the long- term CRC risk in patients after colonoscopic polypectomy in a very large “real world” community-based population (Aim 1). He will also identify patient-, polyp-, and exam-related risk factors associated with incident CRC in these patients (Aim 2). Finally, he will develop a CRC risk prediction model that will identify post- polypectomy patients at high and low risk for developing subsequent CRC (Aim 3). To achieve these goals, Dr. Lee and his mentors have designed a career development plan for research and educational training to obtain: 1) knowledge and expertise in advanced epidemiologic methods for design and analysis of cohort studies; 2) knowledge in medical informatics methods; and 3) predictive modeling skills. To achieve the proposed research aims, Dr. Lee will leverage the rich electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large community-based healthcare system, in which data on patient, physician, colonoscopy, pathology, and CRC status have been collected since 1994. In addition, Dr. Lee will use an established natural language processing tool to efficiently collect data and evaluate potential confounding variables from more than 600,000 colonoscopy reports in order to address one of the main practical challenges that have limited the feasibility of large-scale population-based studies. Thus, completion of these aims has the potential to improve prevention and early detection of CRC, impact current surveillance guidelines for post-polypectomy patients, and reduce overuse and underuse of surveillance colonoscopy. Importantly, this proposal is realistic and feasible within the award period and will allow Dr. Lee to continue to build research skills, generate preliminary data, create additional collaborative relationships, and compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K07 award will support and accelerate the career development activities of Dr. Lee and allow him to successfully launch into the next phase of his career as an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized controlled trials have shown that screening reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. Thus in this proposal, we will determine the long-term risk and risk factors of CRC after colonoscopic polypectomy, and develop a CRC risk prediction model to tailor surveillancein post- polypectomy patients using a large, community-based cohort.","Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort",9766215,K07CA212057,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Polypectomy', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Premalignant', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scheme', 'Stratification', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Surveillance Program', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adenoma', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'skills', 'surveillance strategy', 'tool']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K07,2019,171720,0.04166201725213926
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018,9769695,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antioxidants', 'Apical', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Budesonide', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Chinese People', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'Taiwan', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vitamin E', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'bile salts', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'hepatotoxin', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outreach', 'pediatric patients', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'transcriptomics', 'transport inhibitor', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,256000,-0.0032807891622824194
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9780580,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2019,7702,0.018219141229783027
"Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia Project Summary/Abstract: The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with transdisciplinary expertise in cancer epidemiology, biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation. The focused didactic training, mentorship, and experiential learning through research activities proposed in this award will facilitate the development of critical skills in the pursuit of knowledge to inform and improve cancer prevention and screening. The candidate's research is motivated by the recognition that type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at a 30-40% increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), and that anti-diabetic drugs may also alter CRC risk. Thus, this high-risk group presents an opportunity for targeted screening and early detection of CRC. Currently, CRC screening is based on age and family history, with no consideration for comorbidities, including T2DM. Building on her previous work in cancer epidemiology, the candidate seeks to determine the association between T2DM and risk of colorectal polyps: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity, individually reflecting different molecular pathways (Aim 1); and to examine the risk for colorectal polyps associated with anti-diabetic therapy: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity (Aim 2). These aims will be addressed by leveraging the rich resources of an existing colonoscopy- based cohort at the University of Washington Medical Center's (UWMC) Gastroenterology clinic established during 2003-2011. Demographics, select lifestyle factors, and detailed histopathology have been previously abstracted from UWMC's electronic medical records (EMR) database. The candidate proposes to extend this cohort through 2017 (N~38,000), and enhance it by linking existing data with diabetes-related variables from the EMR database using biomedical informatics (e.g., natural language processing, clinical text mining) to estimate the risk for colorectal neoplasia. Using these empirical estimates derived from Aims 1 and 2, the candidate will then build a microsimulation model projecting the risk for colorectal neoplasia in T2DM patients, accounting for their diabetes therapy. Alternative screening and treatment strategies, including altering the screening start-age, modifying diabetes treatment, or altering screening modality among T2DM patients, will be evaluated for their cost-effectiveness (Aim 3). This work may help inform targeted screening recommendations that could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening. The candidate has proposed a training and career development plan that builds upon her prior skills in cancer epidemiology to gain experience and proficiency in biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation, including cost-effectiveness approaches. The transdisciplinary mentorship team, comprised of national and international experts, will provide the necessary expertise to ensure the success of this proposal, as well as facilitate the candidate's transition into an independent translational investigator in the field of cancer prevention and screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to determine the link between clinically diagnosed type-2 diabetes mellitus, use of anti-diabetic medications, and risk of colorectal polyp subtypes, including differences by lesion severity. Evaluating the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening among persons with type-2 diabetes may help inform targeted screening recommendations, which could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening.","Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia",9741106,K07CA222060,"['Accounting', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Award', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Models', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Family', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metformin', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Smoking History', 'Subgroup', 'Sulfonylurea Compounds', 'Testing', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer prevention', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'demographics', 'diabetes mellitus therapy', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'economic evaluation', 'experience', 'health economics', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'mortality', 'non-diabetic', 'personalized screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'skills', 'success', 'text searching', 'translational scientist', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K07,2019,158153,0.010956516712414363
"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia.

"Applying statistical learning tools to personalize cardiovascular treatment Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) treatment is often guided by risk stratification tools (to decide who to treat), and randomized controlled trials (to decide which treatments to select). Prior CVD research reveals two major  obstacles to improving our treatment approach: (i) longitudinal cohort data are unavailable for recalibrating risk stratification tools for local-area estimation (by zip code), or for people with major CVD-promoting  comorbidities (e.g., chronic kidney disease); and (ii) the average treatment effect in randomized trials can be highly erroneous when projected onto individuals that vary from the ‘average’ participant in a trial. CVD risk- stratification and treatment effect estimation can be improved and personalized if we overcome a critical barrier to progress: correctly estimating risk and treatment effect from new, large participant data repositories, which have greater population size and include patients with more co-morbid conditions than common cohort studies, and which permit personalized risk/benefit prediction tool development from individual-level data. Our prior studies show that we can critically advance the field by applying novel statistical learning methods to this data, to address: (i) false-positives from multiple testing; (ii) the reliance on standard regressions that cannot account for non-linear, complex interactions between factors; and (iii) identifying the optimal approach among many alternative statistical learning methods. We propose to apply our work in these areas to (Aim 1) Develop CVD risk stratification tools for patients with inadequate sample sizes in common cohort studies. We will enhance CVD risk stratification to include local-area adjustment (by zip code) and major co-morbid conditions affecting CVD risk (e.g., chronic kidney disease). We will additionally (Aim 2) develop personalized treatment effect  prediction tools to guide decisions for CVD therapies with high potential benefit and risk, for therapies where  individual participant data from trials are available. We have obtained the individual participant data from the large randomized trials that reveal wide variations in CVD risk reduction and serious adverse event risk increase from three drug classes: non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, intensive blood pressure treatment, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors for diabetes. Our preliminary research shows that traditional  regression methods cannot distinguish which patients are most likely to benefit or be harmed by such therapies, but our statistical learning methods can. Finally, we will (Aim 3) develop open-source tools to improve the ability of researchers to choose an optimal statistical learning approach for their dataset and problem. While numerous statistical learning methods have been proposed in the literature, a key problem for biomedical scientists  without access to RCT data is: which method should I use to estimate treatment effects from observational data? Building on our innovative approach to identify the optimal inference method for observational data, we will construct an open-source tool to compare methods, identifying which method most often results in optimal treatment decisions that minimize error and maximize performance on standardized metrics. Public health relevance  Using current cardiovascular disease risk stratification tools, about 31.6 million Americans will receive an incorrect cardiovascular disease risk estimate that will lead to wrong treatment, per current guidelines.  Furthermore, extrapolating the average treatment effect for major preventive cardiovascular disease treatments— rather than calculating a personalized risk/benefit score—contributes to 4.9 million serious adverse events from treatment complications each year. In this project, we seek to address both problems: improving  cardiovascular disease risk stratification, and developing personalized calculators for risk and benefit of major  cardiovascular disease treatments.",Applying statistical learning tools to personalize cardiovascular treatment,9637461,R01HL144555,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anticoagulants', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Fasting', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population Sizes', 'Preventive', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Reduction', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Sodium', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Thromboplastin', 'Variant', 'Wages', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'biomedical scientist', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular disorder therapy', 'clinical care', 'data warehouse', 'editorial', 'fasting glucose', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'stroke risk', 'symporter', 'tool', 'tool development', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,774381,0.024301764488890144
"Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial PROJECT SUMMARY Overdose deaths have skyrocketed in the United States since 1999. The epidemic has prompted widespread federal and state actions, yet the number of people who die of an overdose continues to increase. In light of the accelerating and rapidly evolving overdose epidemic, new strategies are needed to identify communities most at risk, and to utilize resources more effectively to curb overdose deaths. To address these public health priorities, we will develop a forecasting tool to predict overdose deaths before they occur, and then conduct a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention to evaluate resource targeting based on these predictions. The study will take place in Rhode Island, a state with the 10th highest rate of overdose fatality in 2016. The study has two phases. First, we will develop a predictive analytics model that forecasts future overdose mortality at the neighborhood-level, using publicly available information and data from a multicomponent overdose surveillance system. This tool, called PROVIDENT (Preventing Overdose using Information and Data from the Environment) will be used to predict the likelihood of magnitude of future overdose deaths in every neighborhood across Rhode Island. Next, we will conduct a randomized policy experiment to evaluate whether targeting overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods at highest risk reduces overdose morbidity and mortality. The state's department of health will receive PROVIDENT model predictions for half of the 39 cities/towns in Rhode Island. Within these cities/town, the health department will work with stakeholders to target overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods with the highest probability of future overdose deaths. Interventions include efforts to: (1) prevent high-risk prescribing (through academic detailing and other educational efforts); (2) expand access to opioid agonist therapy, including buprenorphine and methadone; (3) increase naloxone distribution (through community and pharmacy-based efforts); and (4) expand street-based peer recovery coaching and referrals. Control cities/town will continue to receive these interventions, but without targeting to specific neighborhoods. Fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose rates in the control cities/towns will be compared to those that received the PROVIDENT model predictions. To achieve these aims, we will leverage a unique partnership between an academic institution and a state's health department, which allows for unprecedented access to and sharing of population-based overdose surveillance data. Our results will improve public health decision-making and inform resource allocation to communities that should be prioritized for evidence-based prevention, treatment, recovery, and overdose rescue services. If found to be effective, the PROVIDENT forecasting model will be disseminated to other states, which could adapt the tool to guide resource allocation and maximize public health impact. In sum, this project is highly responsive to a top research priority of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and directly addresses one of the nation's most challenging public health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objectives of this project are to leverage surveillance data to predict future overdose outbreaks, and to evaluate the impact of a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention trial to target overdose prevention programs to neighborhoods at highest risk of future overdose deaths. This study develops and tests an opioid overdose forecasting tool, which will allow other states to identify and deploy interventions to communities at highest risk of opioid-related death. This results study will significantly improve the allocation of resources to curb the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States.","Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial",9817054,R01DA046620,"['Academic Detailing', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'American', 'Area', 'Buprenorphine', 'Censuses', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Community Pharmacy', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Community Trial', 'Intervention Trial', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methadone', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Naloxone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neighborhoods', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Research Priority', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid policy', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'overdose prevention', 'overdose risk', 'peer', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'referral services', 'resource guides', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment arm']",NIDA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,718669,-0.0010231347171334906
"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,9675331,R01MH113622,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Work', 'base', 'childhood adversity', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'laboratory experience', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'negative mood', 'network models', 'physical conditioning', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,569073,-0.015736097560569474
"Infrared Eyes(iREyes) Infrared Eyes Abstract Eden Medical, Inc. is pleased to resubmit this Phase 2 SBIR proposal to develop the “Infrared Eyes” (iREyes) imager system, an affordable and powerful mobile health (mHealth) tool for healthcare. The hand-held iREyes system will acquire both thermal and visible spectrum imagery to quantify healing via thermal indexing methodology. The iREyes will offer a user-friendly product with automated categorization. Diabetic foot wounds are common, complex and costly. Foot areas that are likely to ulcerate are associated with increased local skin temperature due to inflammation and enzymatic autolysis of tissue. Inflammation is characterized by the cardinal signs including redness, swelling, and heat. In addition to identifying inflammation associated with healing, the iREyes will also identify hot spots associated with repetitive stress to reduce ulceration and re-ulceration risk for people in diabetic foot remission. The iREyes will directly quantify inflammation pathophysiology implementing a powerful revised two-part strategy: wound healing via regional foot index analysis and ulcer reoccurrence risk through temperature asymmetry threshold analysis. The combined thermal indexing for healing existing wounds and asymmetry predictive analysis represents a significant breakthrough over current practice.

"Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic disabling psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent maladaptive reaction to the exposure to severe psychological stress, including trauma re-experiencing, hypervigilance, and hyperarousal. Our group has conducted seminal work to establish PTSD as a risk factor for coronary heart disease and autonomic dysfunction. A major concern, based on these findings, is that PTSD could increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) through autonomic dysregulation. This has important clinical implications on management of cardiovascular risk in PTSD. Two important metrics that are potentially useful for risk stratification are T-wave alternans (TWA) and Morphological Beat Variability (MVB). We have found in preliminary investigations that TWA may be linked to acute stress and PTSD, but additional study is needed. In this R03 application, we seek to collaborate with Dr. Gari Clifford in Biomedical Informatics to create a custom program that measures TWA and MVB with state-of- the-art signal processing in a recently recruited cohort of male veteran twins with high-resolution ECG data. We will also study for genetic influences with twin modeling and the effects of acute stress with laboratory- based trauma reminder challenges. Our aims are to 1) Examine the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA a) over 24 hours, and b) during trauma recall challenge; 2) Evaluate the potential role for familial and genetic factors by comparing the within-pair difference in MVB and TWA between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs discordant for PTSD. We hypothesize that MVB and TWA will be higher, on average, during a 24 hour period, and will increase during trauma recall challenge in PTSD subjects compared to those without PTSD. In addition, we hypothesize that the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA will be stronger within DZ pairs than MZ pairs, implying that there is a common genetic pathway linking PTSD and SCD risk. The development of methods to measure these factors, as well as the study of these important mechanisms, will accelerate Dr. Shah’s progress towards research independence, and help to establish him as an expert in the field of mental stress and SCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Posttraumatic stress disorder is a common and debilitating psychiatric condition that is associated with increased heart disease risk. Whether or not this means that it increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia is not known, but important for clinical management. To study this, we aim to examine the risk of PTSD and its symptoms on electrocardiographic markers of sudden cardiac death.",Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study,9723857,R03HL146879,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Arrhythmia', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional Stress', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Stress', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Tachyarrhythmias', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Twin Studies', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Veterans', 'Viola', 'Visit', 'War', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'heart disease risk', 'heart rate variability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'male', 'method development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'programs', 'recruit', 'signal processing', 'sudden cardiac death', 'traumatic event', 'vector']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,78000,0.03047763705664889
"Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 mo is considered the optimal form of nutrition for most newborns, yet many women experience substantial roadblocks in meeting this goal. One of the most common reason for  lactation cessation is mastitis (inflammation of the breast). Mastitis is also a significant concern for the US dairy industry because, not only does it represent a significant challenge to animal welfare, but it also decreases milk production and is the most common reason animals are treated with antibiotics. Despite decades of research, mastitis prevention and treatment are poorly understood in both species. One reason for this is that, although mastitis has historically been attributed to the presence of bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, this dogma is now known to be incorrect. Modern advances in the use of DNA sequencing (rather than needing to grow bacteria in culture media) have resulted in a paradigm shift in this regard such that researchers now know that all milk produced by both healthy and mastitic cows and women contains a rich community of microbes. Experts now believe that a dysbiosis in these microbes or a shift in their metabolism causes mammary  inflammation. Consequently, we must now re-examine everything we thought we knew about the etiology and risk factors for this disease. Fundamental to filling this research gap is the rigorous characterization of the  microbiome in milk produced by healthy and mastitic women and cows; and identification of microbial community  “fingerprints” and metabolomic modifiers, thereof, that alter risk of mammary inflammation. In addition,  understanding the similarities and dissimilarities in mammary inflammation between cows and women will help  researchers understand whether the former can be used as a model for the latter (and vice versa). The overall objectives for this project are to 1) compare and contrast the milk microbiome, its functionality, immune  parameters, and inflammatory markers in healthy and mastitic women and cows, and 2) identify milk microbial  profiles and their functionality related to risk for mammary inflammation. Our central hypotheses are that  1) mammary inflammation in both species is associated with shifts in microbes and their function, concentrations of selected markers of immunity and mammary inflammation, and that 2) there exist detectable milk microbiome patterns (or functions) that predispose some women and cows to increased risk of inflammation, and these patterns are related to (and perhaps modified by) environmental and behavioral parameters, some of which are currently considered risk factors for mastitis. To test these hypotheses, we will compare healthy and mastitic cows and women (case-control design) during the first 6 wk postpartum (longitudinal, repeated-measures  design during a high-risk period in both species). Importantly, we will utilize a multi-omics approach and machine learning to understand complex relationships within and between species. The results of this work will lead to better understanding of how the microbiology of the lactating mammary gland is related to mammary  inflammation and will lay the groundwork for future studies to determine how this disease can be prevented and treated. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inflammation of the mammary gland (mastitis) is the leading cause for cessation of breastfeeding, considered the optimal form of nutrition for almost all newborns worldwide, and a major animal welfare and economic  burden for the dairy industry. Mastitis has been attributed to bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, but new evidence demonstrates that all milk (healthy and mastitic) contains a community of microbes. Understanding the bacterial community in milk, and its function, with related host immune response will lead to a reduction in the risk of inflammation in dairy cows and women, support breastfeeding, and promote optimal health in  mothers and infants.",Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis,9776590,R01HD092297,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cattle', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Culture Media', 'DNA sequencing', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Etiology', 'Exclusive Breastfeeding', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Industry', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Lactation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammary gland', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'high risk', 'inflammatory marker', 'inflammatory milieu', 'macromolecule', 'mastitis', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'milk microbiome', 'milk production', 'multiple omics', 'nutrition', 'offspring', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'protein metabolite', 'virtual']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,R01,2019,501342,0.01936356466735721
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9697234,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'circadian', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social deficits', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,1273593,0.0029457438145358865
"Disentangling the Epidemiologic and Genetic Heterogeneity of Postpartum Depression to Predict Risk and Prognosis PROJECT SUMMARY Postpartum depression (PPD), a common complication of childbirth, has significant morbidity and mortality for mother and child, yet etiology is still poorly understood. PPD is a more heritable subtype of MDD, yet significant heterogeneity exists within the PPD phenotype, which may reflect differences in etiology. This study aims to disentangle the heterogeneity of PPD to understand etiology by leveraging existing data from two unique global resources, the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and the US arm of the Postpartum Depression: Action Towards Causes and Treatment Consortium. The study aims to 1) apply modern statistical learning methods in a master training set (N=63,528) and two independent testing sets (N=31,716 and N=4,978) to identify PPD subtypes, 2) identify genetic contributors to PPD subtypes and genetic overlap with other traits, and 3) examine the extent to which PPD subtypes predict longer-term mental health prognosis. This research will support my primary career goal to become an independently funded investigator with the expertise necessary to conduct integrated epidemiologic and genomic research to understand the complex etiology of PPD. My long-term research objective is to develop comprehensive risk prediction models that can ultimately be translated into effective preventive interventions and novel individualized treatments for PPD. I have expertise is in epidemiology and perinatal health, but I need additional mentored training to conduct large- scale, integrated gene-environment analyses to understand the biological basis of PPD. The specific objectives to meet my career goal are to 1) develop skills in data science to effectively analyze large, complex datasets, 2) establish an in-depth understanding of genomics and statistical genetics, and 3) understand the complex phenotypes of PPD and other related psychiatric conditions. The core mentorship team consists of Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, lead mentor, an internationally recognized expert in perinatal mental health research, and Dr. Patrick Sullivan, co-lead mentor, a psychiatric geneticist who has built a collaborative network of depression research in Scandinavia. Dr. Yun Li, co-mentor, has extensive experience in developing statistical and computational methods for genomic and high-dimensional data. Dr. Ted Reichborn-Kjennerud, co-mentor, and Drs. Helga Ask and Alexandra Havdahl, collaborators, have extensive experience with assessment of psychiatric outcomes in the MoBa cohort. Dr. Cathryn Lewis, collaborator, is a leading expert in the development of genetic risk score methodology. Their combined mentorship will place me in an ideal position to succeed as an independent investigator. This work will inform further investigation of unique contributions of genes and environment to develop multifactorial predictive models for PPD, representing an important step towards personalized medicine in perinatal mental health. The vital skills I attain during this grant award will provide a foundation for future research evaluating interventions for prevention and personalized therapeutic treatments of PPD. PROJECT NARRATIVE PPD is a common complication of childbirth with substantial morbidity, mortality, and personal and societal costs. Identifying subtypes of PPD (Aim 1), their genetic overlap with other psychiatric disorders and traits (Aim 2), and examining how they predict longer-term mental health prognosis (Aim 3) will make a significant contribution to understanding the biological underpinnings of PPD and determining potential points of intervention. Disentangling the heterogeneity of PPD and developing sophisticated risk prediction models that integrate genetic and epidemiologic risk factors could ultimately assist in early detection, differential diagnosis, and development of personalized intervention and treatment options for these devastating disorders.",Disentangling the Epidemiologic and Genetic Heterogeneity of Postpartum Depression to Predict Risk and Prognosis,9805582,K01MH120352,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Child', 'Childbirth', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Norway', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Depression', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Progesterone', 'Psychometrics', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scandinavia', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'arm', 'biopsychosocial', 'career', 'chronic depression', 'cohort', 'early life adversity', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'perinatal health', 'perinatal mental health', 'perinatal period', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'reproductive', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'societal costs', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'stressor', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K01,2019,150200,-0.008079915936506943
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9722280,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2019,129089,0.02187495354293035
"Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress PROJECT SUMMARY Childhood traumatic stress (CTS), resulting from experiences such as abuse and neglect, is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences effecting overall health across the lifespan. Growing evidence shows that the negative effects of CTS are not limited to a single individual and may be transmitted across generations, increasing the risk for behavioral and psychiatric disorders in the offspring. Psychological stress during pregnancy is associated with heightened stress responses, emotional dysregulation, and behavioral problems in infancy and early childhood potentially making it a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of trauma. The majority of studies examining maternal psychological stress (MPS) during pregnancy consider the magnitude of stress as the `risk factor' for alterations in offspring development; however, psychological stress, particularly during the prenatal period, is dynamic and variable. Infant neurodevelopment occurs sequentially and is sensitive to environmental influences, meaning that the effect of any insult is likely as much about the timing, as it is the magnitude. As a result, it remains unclear which aspects of stress most strongly impact offspring development – is it simply the magnitude as previously suggested, or does the trajectory matter as well? Understanding the variability of prenatal factors and their influence on infant neurobiological and psychosocial development is critical to targeting preventive interventions. The goal of this proposal is to explore maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress. The overall hypothesis is that a history of maternal CTS will increase the amplitude and velocity of MPS trajectories compared to a low-risk group, will predict increased offspring limbic system connectivity and negative affect expression, and that an intervention to reduce MPS in a high-risk sample will alter the observed trajectories. These hypotheses will be tested using a novel methodology that characterizes the longitudinal heterogeneity of psychological symptom data to create MPS trajectories. These trajectories will be used to explore the role of timing and rate of change of MPS on offspring neurobiological and affective development and, further, to test whether these trajectories mediate the effects of CTS on infant development. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To characterize the longitudinal heterogeneity of MPS in a sample of women with and without a history of CTS; (2) To examine the effects of heterogeneous longitudinal trajectories in MPS on offspring limbic system and negative affect development in mothers with and without childhood trauma; and (3) (Exploratory) To determine whether an intervention designed to reduce MPS will alter MPS trajectories in a high-risk sample. This study aims to elucidate the importance of trajectories of MPS for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS. Achieving these goals will provide insight into the best timing for targeted screening and interventions to alter MPS during pregnancy for women with a history of CTS and, thereby, reduce the risk of offspring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood traumatic stress is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences for psychological well-being, such as increased stress reactivity and increased risk for perinatal psychopathology. The proposed research will integrate tools from developmental neuroscience, clinical science, and computer science to: (1) examine the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a potential mediator of childhood traumatic stress on infant brain and negative affect development; and (2) evaluate whether an intervention designed to reduce maternal psychological stress will alter the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal prenatal stress. By identifying the importance of trajectories of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS, this work stands to improve the targeting and timing of prenatal interventions for women with a history of childhood traumatic stress.",Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress,9794014,F30MH118762,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Limbic System', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'maternal stress', 'mindfulness based cognitive therapy', 'negative affect', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pediatric trauma', 'prenatal', 'prenatal intervention', 'prenatal stress', 'psychological symptom', 'psychosocial development', 'random forest', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'stress reactivity', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,0.009453699404944414
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,9785527,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2019,192917,0.02375900468913015
"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis,9676982,K23MH116130,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Israel', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'computational basis', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'economic cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal course', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotoxic', 'open source', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'responsible research conduct', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'smart watch', 'social', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIMH,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2019,190676,0.017955008524235115
"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,9938134,R01HS027369,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,497444,0.01343604864292288
"Chronic Inflammation and Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-omics Approach ABSTRACT The etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) likely involves a complex interaction of polygenic, metabolic, and environmental factors including diet. Accumulating experimental, epidemiological, and clinical evidence supports a pathogenic role of chronic inflammation in T2D development. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these findings are largely unknown, and current evidence on the causal relationships between specific inflammatory pathways and T2D risk is inconclusive. Advances in omics technologies have led to the identification of genes and metabolites associated with T2D risk, but data on mechanisms and causality are still very limited. Multi-omics integration in the framework of systems epidemiology may provide new avenues to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms. To systematically investigate the relation between chronic inflammation and T2D, I propose to examine 3 Specific Aims by leveraging the rich resources in the UK Biobank, Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS), Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (SOL), and Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx). In Aim 1 [K99], I will integrate existing genomic data from the UK Biobank, NHS/HPFS, SOL, and transcriptomic data in the GTEx to examine shared genetic architectures between systemic inflammatory markers and T2D and whether polygenic susceptibility to chronic inflammation confers T2D risk. Meanwhile, I will receive extensive training in T2D systems biology and cutting-edge high-dimensional data analytics and bioinformatics. In Aim 2 [R00], I will integrate dietary and metabolomic data to examine metabolomic profiles mediating the association between dietary inflammatory potentials and T2D risk in the prospective NHS/HPFS and the SOL. In Aim 3 [R00], I will conduct plasma proteomic profiling in a nested case-control study within the NHS to identify inflammatory protein networks in relation to T2D risk, and as a Secondary Aim, integrate findings from Aim 1-3 to explore T2D-related pathways co-regulating at multiple biological dimensions. Findings from this project may improve the understanding of inflammatory mechanisms underlying T2D and identify novel targets/pathways suitable for early detection and prevention. I will be mentored/advised by an interdisciplinary team that includes Dr. JoAnn Manson (diabetes epidemiologist), Dr. Liming Liang (expert in statistical omics methodologies), Dr. Frank Hu (nutritional epidemiologist), Dr. Peter Kraft, (statistical geneticist), Dr. Qibin Qi (genetic epidemiologist), Dr. Towia Libermann (expert in proteomics), and Dr. Clary Clish (expert in metabolomics). The outstanding training opportunities with key leaders in these areas will provide me advanced knowledge and skills, positioning me for a successful, independent career as a diabetes epidemiologist with expertise in systems biology and integrated-omics. This project aligns with the NIDDK’s goal of integrating multi-omics technologies into diabetes research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to systematically examine the relationship between chronic inflammation and type 2 diabetes (T2D) by incorporating multi-omics data from several large prospective cohort studies. The proposed research will yield novel evidence on the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between chronic inflammation and T2D risk. Novel pathways, and specific genes, proteins, and metabolites identified in this research will serve as the critical first steps for future development of biomarkers and therapeutic targets for T2D prevention and treatment.",Chronic Inflammation and Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-omics Approach,9805982,K99DK122128,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Food', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos', 'IL6 gene', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Interleukin-6', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Limes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Nutritional', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Study of Latinos', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Technology', 'Training', 'White Blood Cell Count procedure', 'Work', 'adiponectin', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'diabetes risk', 'disorder prevention', 'genetic architecture', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'response', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2019,91499,0.0024828764029347296
"Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening PROJECT SUMMARY The guidelines for initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are currently based on two risk factors: attained age and family history of CRC. Using the principles of precision medicine, we will individually tailor CRC screening recommendations based on the enormous knowledge we now have on genetic and non- genetic factors that predict risk for this disease. This strategy will reduce under and over-utilization of CRC screening, because individual risks vary substantially in the population, and over 80% of all CRC cases occur in those without a positive family history. In Aim 1 we will develop predictive models for CRC, based on genetic (~30M common and rare genotyped or imputed genetic variants) and clinico-epidemiologic variables (over 70 harmonized characteristics), derived from over 40,000 colorectal tumor cases and 46,000 controls. We will identify key predictors, and derive efficient personalized risk-prediction models for early detection of more treatable CRCs as well for CRC prevention, through the identification of advanced colorectal adenomas. In Aim 2 we will calibrate and validate these models in two prospective cohorts of >120,000 participants, including 40,000 minority members, diversity representing racially/ethnically and socioeconomically. These two cohorts (Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health and the Women's Health Initiative Minority cohort) contain genome-wide genotype array and comprehensive risk factor data coupled to data on screening and outcome data, allowing us to test the model's ability to predict risk for CRC and advanced colorectal adenoma across a broadly defined community-based population, and to personalize decision on starting age of screening based on individually specific genetic and environmental risk factors. In Aim 3 we will estimate the population benefit of our risk-stratified screening strategy, based on our risk prediction methods, compared with the current screening recommendations. This comparison will employ the well-tested decision model currently used to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force CRC screening guidelines. Accomplishing these three aims, our research has the potential to accelerate the translation of a large amount of genetic and epidemiologic research to patient care by predicting advanced adenoma risk, for cancer prevention, and predicting cancer risk, for early cancer detection. Genetic testing is becoming part of routine care and genetic data will increasingly become part of an individual's medical record. Using genetic and non-genetic risk-factor information in clinical and preventive settings is a critical step towards developing precision medicine. Our models will provide recommendations for individually tailored CRC screening and interventions and, because they are personalized, may also increase adherence, maximize the appropriate use of invasive technologies, and guide important next steps towards public health policy development and clinical translation.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, but current recommendations for initiation of CRC screening do not use important information on individual genetic, lifestyle and environmental risks for this disease. Our research, in large CRC consortia will accelerate the translation of several decades of genetic and epidemiologic research on CRC risks, to allow for personalized screening decisions, based on an individual's specific genetic and environmental risk factor distributions. This work will ensure that the most comprehensive information will inform novel precision medicine strategies for CRC.  ",Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening,9618151,R01CA206279,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'member', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized risk prediction', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'rare variant', 'risk prediction model', 'routine care', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,628904,-0.012228339805312266
"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9692475,R01HS025402,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2019,394737,0.008165905688048163
"An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. Project Summary / Abstract Diagnostic errors are increasingly recognized as a cause of pain, suffering and increased healthcare costs. Diagnostic delays are an important class of diagnostic errors. While many diagnostic errors occur in hospital settings, emergency departments visits may be especially important to consider because they treat critically ill patients and because most decisions to admit patients to the hospital are made in emergency departments. Thus, to enable a more complete understanding of diagnostic delays requires consideration of healthcare visits across a range of healthcare settings including clinic visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Delays in diagnosing infectious diseases are important to consider. For contagious infectious diseases, diagnostic delays increase the risk of additional exposures, potentially generating more cases. Second, many infectious diseases can be effectively treated, but even short delays in treatment lead to worse clinical outcomes. However, with the exception of a few infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis), diagnostic delays for infectious diseases are understudied. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact for diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. The overarching goal of our research is to investigate diagnostic delays associated with infectious diseases using existing data along with methods from the fields of computer science and statistics. While our research relies upon “big data”, we will also use clinical experts to review and contribute to all of our results. Our subject matter experts incorporate expertise in infectious diseases, emergency medicine, acute care, medical education, diagnostic reasoning, healthcare epidemiology, public health, industry, and professional infectious disease societies. Specifically, we will 1) determine the incidence of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases; 2) identify the risk factors associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases that are frequently delayed or have serious outcomes; and 3) estimate the impact of diagnostic delays in terms of healthcare costs and mortality. With our data, methods and clinical experts, we will be able to translate our results into future interventions designed to decrease diagnostic delays and improve healthcare outcomes. In addition, while our proposal focuses on infectious diseases, the methods and approaches that we will develop can be adopted to investigate non-infectious diseases and conditions. Project Narrative Diagnostic delays for infectious diseases contribute to worse clinical outcomes, increased healthcare costs and, for some infectious diseases, outbreaks of great public health importance. We will use existing large data sets along with machine-learning techniques and expert clinical guidance to detect patterns of healthcare visits representing diagnostic delays. Our goal is to characterize the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases to inform future interventions.","An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases.",9938200,R01HS027375,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,497273,0.01442815533855289
"Combining Systems Pharmacology Modeling With Machine Learning To Identify Sub-Populations At Risk Of Drug-Induced Torsades de Pointes No abstract available Project Narrative Current standards for identifying patients at risk of forming the rare but lethal ventricular tachycardia, Drug- induced Torsades de Pointes include measuring the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Although this decently predicts susceptibility, there remains a percentage of patients who still succumb to an arrhythmia with a normal QT.

"Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment Diagnosis-based risk adjustment is widely used in the US and abroad for health plan payment, notably for Medicare Parts C and D, for commercial contracting and quality assessment, and in numerous state Medicaid programs. Yet the risk adjustment technology used for payments has not kept up with improved classification systems, larger patient datasets, improved estimation algorithms or recent theoretical and clinical developments. Our work will take advantage of the richer ICD-10-CM classification system, in use since October 2015, with over 5 times as many diagnoses as ICD-9-CM Codes. ICD-10 codes now recognize: left vs. right side for thousands of conditions, distinguish between initial, subsequent and sequela diagnoses, and incorporate hundreds of new clinical, demographic and biometric variables. Based on the ICD-10, more exact models can leverage increased diagnostic coding accuracy to reduce opportunities for gaming or discriminating against patients with conditions who are predicted to be unprofitable. Led by two of the three developers of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS-HCC) existing classification system, our team of physicians, public policy experts, statisticians and economists will comprehensively improve the accuracy of risk adjustment and predictive models using larger sample sizes, clinical judgment and state-of-art economic and statistical modeling. We will also expand the conventional regression methods explored, to include machine learning algorithms, constrained regression, and LASSO estimation. We will calculate a new “appropriateness to include” (ATI) score that captures diagnostic vagueness, discretion and suitability for use in risk adjustment models, and use this score to inform which variables are included in plan payment formulas. Selection incentives remain of concern in public US health plan payments formulas and may be costing Medicare over $5 billion per year (NBER 2017). Prediction and payment models from this project can reduce overpayment and offset plan incentives to skimp on services that attract sick people. To ensure that these models and formulas are useful for enrollees of all ages, they will initially be calibrated and tested on large commercially-insured claims data, covering ages 0 to 64. They will then be validated and refined for Medicare, Medicaid, and state employees using data from All-Payer Claims Data from five states and a second large commercial dataset. We will make development steps, statistical programs, and full details of the classification system and prediction formulas publicly available for comment, refinement, and use by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers. Project Narrative This project will develop new classification systems and new prediction and payment models that take advantage of the fivefold increase in diagnostic codes available with the October 2015 change from ICD- 9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Using data from two national claims datasets and five state all-payer claims datasets that collectively cover over 75 million enrollees, we will identify new, underutilized ICD-10 capabilities, create new clusters of diagnoses useful for prediction, develop new algorithms for using these clusters, and estimate formulas that predict spending, utilization and diverse health care outcomes for all ages. Methods and results will be publicly described and software posted on the web for use in risk adjustment and diverse clinical, financial, policy evaluation, and quality assessment outcomes by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers.",Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment,9775421,R01HS026485,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,384093,0.020844329792444948
"Developing Computational Methods for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistant Agents PROJECT ABSTRACT  Antimicrobial resistance is a critical public health issue. Infections with drug resistant pathogens are estimated to cause an additional eight million hospitalization days annually over the hospitalizations that would be seen for infections with susceptible agents. The use of antibiotics (in both clinical and agricultural settings) is being viewed as precursor for these infections and thus, is a major public health concern—particularly as outbreaks become more frequent and severe. However, scientiﬁc evidence describing the hazards associated with antibiotic use is lacking due to inability to quantify the risk of these practices. One promising avenue to elucidate this risk is to use shotgun metagenomics to identify the AMR genes in samples taken through systematic spatiotemporal surveillance. The goal of this proposed work is to develop algorithms that will provide such a means for analysis. The algorithms need to be scalable to very large datasets and thus, will require the development and use succinct data structures.  In order to achieve this goal, the investigative team will develop the theoretical foundations and applied meth- ods needed to study AMR through the use of shotgun metagenomics. A major focus of the proposed work is developing algorithms that can handle very large datasets. To achieve this scalability, we will create novel means to create, compress, reconstruct and update very large de Bruijn graphs that metagenomics data in a manner needed to study AMR. In addition, we will pioneer the study of AMR through long read data by proposing new algorithmic problems and solutions that use data. For example, identifying the location of speciﬁc genes in a metagenomics sample using long read data has not been proposed or studied. Thus, the algorithmic ideas and techniques developed in this project will not only advance the study of AMR, but contribute to the growing domain of big data analysis and pan-genomics.  Lastly, we plan to apply our methods to samples collected from both agricultural and clinical settings in Florida. Analysis of preliminary and new data will allow us to conclude about (1) the public risk associated with antimicro- bial use in agriculture; (2) the effectiveness of interventions used to reduce resistant bacteria, and lastly, (3) the factors that allow resistant bacteria to grow, thrive and evolve. A–1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Antibiotic use in agriculture is a major public health concern that is receiving a lot of media attention, par- ticularly as antibiotic-resistant infections in become more frequent and severe. This research will build a novel bioinformatics framework for determining how antimicrobial resistant genes evolve, grow, and persist in a system that has been affected by antibiotic use. This will, in turn, facilitate the development of effective intervention methods that reduce resistant pathogens in clinical and agricultural settings.

"Molecular Biomarkers of Dangerous Intracranial Aneurysms Abstract Rupture of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) causes intracranial hemorrhaging that leads to high rates of neurological deficits and death. Although rupture rates are low, clinicians must decide whether to treat or monitor these potentially dangerous lesions. In the current clinical practice, the most common metric to measure risk of rupture is aneurysm size (≥7 mm or ≥5 mm). However, clinical data show that small aneurysms can also rupture. As a result, alternative clinical stratification scores have been proposed, including the PHASES (Population, Hypertension, Age, Size, Earlier subarachnoid hemorrhage, and Site) score based on patient demographics and IA characteristics to stratify ruptured and unruptured IAs, and the Rupture Resemblance Score (RRS) that stratifies ruptured and unruptured IAs based on hemodynamic and morphological properties. However, all metrics require imagining on digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which is invasive, expensive, requires the use of X-rays, and is associated with transient or permanent neurological and non-neurological complications. In previous studies, we found that patients with and without IAs have RNA expression differences in their circulating blood that reflect leukocyte activation and inflammatory signaling. Expression differences could both identify the presence of IAs and stratify IA samples by size. We therefore hypothesize that individuals with dangerous IAs have detectable gene expression differences in their blood that could be used as biomarkers to determine rupture risk. In this Phase-I study, we propose to use whole blood transcriptomes to develop a “one- stop” diagnostic test that can detect the presence of IAs and determine the risk of rupture based on circulating RNA expression biomarkers using our prototype AneuScreenTM platform. We aim to: 1) Develop and validate biomarkers to predict risk indicated by the currently-used size metric, 2) Develop and validate biomarkers to predict risk indicated by the clinical PHASES score, and 2) Develop and validate biomarkers to predict risk indicated by the RRS. These biomarkers will save the healthcare millions in unnecessary high-cost imaging procedures and unnecessary aneurysm treatments. Project Narrative Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) can lead to devastating health consequences upon rupture. Because rupture is uncommon, there is a need for clinicians to have an objective metric of rupture risk that can help classify IAs as high-risk or low-risk lesions. In this project we aim to develop circulating whole blood gene expression biomarker of aneurysm risk. This biomarker once incorporated into our AneuScreenTM diagnostic platform will help avoid unnecessary aneurysm treatments by: (1) stratifying IA cases between those that are high-risk and require treatment, and those that are low-risk and can be periodically monitored; (2) enabling a low-cost, non-invasive alternative to frequently monitor IAs; and (3) determining the need for follow-up imaging in the case of a positive AneuScreenTM test, as low risk IAs may only need magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), while high risk IAs may directly receive DSA for imaging and possible preventive treatment. Successful completion of this Phase I will clarify if a pre-imaging blood test can stratifying IA risk. This augmented capability will lead to more vigilant and cost-effective IA management.",Molecular Biomarkers of Dangerous Intracranial Aneurysms,9907236,R43NS115314,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Aneurysm', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Cells', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical stratification', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Dangerousness', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Digital Subtraction Angiography', 'Dose', 'Endothelium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preventive treatment', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Surface', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'indexing', 'leukocyte activation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'phase 1 study', 'prototype', 'response', 'shear stress', 'transcriptome']",NINDS,"NEUROVASCULAR DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2019,224975,0.03161696764080814
"Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma SUMMARY: In 2016, nearly 50,000 adults in the US were diagnosed with oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and nearly 10,000 died from the disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as the most common cause of oropharyngeal (OP) SCC in the US. Although concomitant chemo- and radio-therapy is the most common treatment choice in patients with advanced OP-SCC, they have substantial short- and long- term morbidity and result in increased health care costs in patients who are cured of their cancers. These patients live with sometimes disabling morbidity for many years post-treatment. For these reasons, it has been suggested that therapy in lower risk patients might be de-escalated. There is also a higher risk cohort of patients in whom treatment with chemo-radiation may be insufficient, often resulting in distant metastatic failure. As such, these patients may require intensified therapies to improve outcomes. This is an agonizing choice for patients and their doctors, however. While patients do not want to be sickened by morbid treatments, they are obviously concerned about having the best chance at cure. Unfortunately, there currently are no companion diagnostic tools to identify which HPV + OPSCC patients are at (1) low risk of recurrence such that they can be treated safely to high cure rates with de-escalated therapy; (2) higher risk of failure despite aggressive high dose chemoradiation in whom treatment intensification strategies should be studied.  Recently, we developed a quantitative histomorphometric based image risk classifier (QuHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to predict progression in HPV+ OP-SCC patients; the current version of QuHbIC has already been validated in >400 patients and found to be superior to clinical variables in outcome prediction. In this Academic-Industry Partnership we seek to further improve predictive accuracy of QuHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as promising markers of unfavorable prognosis in HPV+ OP-SCC. We also seek to create a pre-commercial QuHbIC companion diagnostic test that is ready for clinical use in risk stratification in p16+ OP-SCC. QuHbIC will be trained on >700 retrospectively identified HPV + OP-SCC whole tissue slide images with associated long term outcome data and then validated on 440 cases from randomized, controlled, multi-institutional RTOG 0129 and 0522 clinical trials.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) computational histomorphometry from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve University, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in HPV+ OPSCC from Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic and, (3) Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company that will bring quality management systems and production software standards to establish QuHbIC as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for oropharyngeal cancers. Project Relevance: In this project we propose to optimize and validate a quantitative histomorphometric-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to better risk stratify survival among p16+ (Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related) OPSCC patients. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be either ""de-escalated”, left as standard, or even potentially escalated, depending on risk status.",Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma,9663910,R01CA220581,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International Union Against Cancer', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stage Grouping', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Universities', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'common treatment', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'economic need', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'pharynx squamous cell carcinoma', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,614169,-0.022269050783056986
"Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting Project Summary/Abstract Background and Candidate: Children with orofacial clefting present with increased rate of dental anomalies in shape, size, number, symmetry, abnormal eruption and malposition of teeth both inside and outside the cleft area, leading to dental problems and reduction of quality of life. Although the scientific community has recognized these findings for a long time, the specific etiological factors underlying such anomalies still remain elusive. An important step to understanding etiology is via careful phenotypic approaches that can detect the co-occurrence of such anomalies in discernable patterns that can simplify the identification of risk factors. Dr. Brian Howe is a Clinical Assistant Professor at the College of Dentistry of the University of Iowa. His primary research focus is on the identification and characterization of oral phenotypes in an effort to identify etiological factors underlying the oral phenotypic spectrum of nonsyndromic orofacial clefting. Career Goals: Dr. Howe's short term goals are to deepen is knowledge of complex craniofacial phenotypes and expand his current understanding of craniofacial development. His long term goals are to become a funded independent researcher and a leading clinician and educator in the field of craniofacial phenomics and dentistry as a tenure track faculty at a University of Iowa. His research plan is innovative in that it leverages unique bioinformatics algorithms to identify complex oral phenotypic patterns amenable for studies of risk factors and causality. Environment: The University of Iowa has an established reputation for the successful training of graduate and postdoctoral students in research and clinical areas. It offers learning and development seminars focused on career development and advancement with particular benefits from training opportunities from its Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences (ICTS). Career Development Plan: Dr. Howe is committed to attend courses, tutorials, seminars and relevant conferences as well as meeting regularly with his mentors, collaborators, and advisory committee to fulfill is training aims and gain the knowledge necessary to achieve his future research goals and become an independent clinical researcher. Research Study: This research aims to identify oral phenotypic patterns in orofacial clefting using modern and traditional pattern mining methods in a diverse international population with existing environmental and genetic variables. This knowledge will have key implications in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting as well as driving the implementation of innovative treatment approaches to improve dental outcomes and future preventive strategies.

The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9747912,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'risk prediction model', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2019,168896,0.007971774704393956
"Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants PROJECT SUMMARY Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening, gastrointestinal (GI) emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. ""Leaky gut"", or intestinal barrier immaturity with elevated intestinal permeability (IP), is the proximate cause of susceptibility to NEC in preterm neonates. Early detection of leaky gut is essential to identify infants at risk for NEC to prevent and reduce disease severity. No clinical factor, routine laboratory test or biomarker alone or in combination have been described that identify preterm neonates with impaired intestinal barrier function who at increased risk for NEC. The goal of this study is to develop a rapid, non-invasive screening tool to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. We recently revealed rapid maturation of the intestinal barrier is strongly associated with clinical factors such as early breastmilk feeding, less antibiotic exposure and later post-menstrual age, and significantly higher abundance and metabolic activities of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Although the butyrate producing Clostridiales have been implicated in strengthening the intestinal epithelial barrier and reducing intestinal inflammation, it is unknown whether butyrate and potentially other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with neonatal intestinal barrier maturation. Our preliminary data revealed butyrate production pathways, in particular Pyruvate/Acetyl-CoA pathway are significantly more abundant in low IP subjects. In this study, we propose to validate a substantiated measure of fecal microbial and/or metabolic biomarkers combined with associated neonatal factors for a rapid, non-invasive screening test. We postulate that the level(s) of metabolic activities, particularly butyrate production and potentially other SCFAs via increased colonization of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium, are associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates. To address our hypothesis, we will leverage existed stool samples collected from a cohort of ~200 preterms (<33 weeks), for whom both microbiota (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and IP (urine non-metabolized sugar probes lactulose and rhamnose) are available, and propose 2 aims: 1) to determine fecal metabolic activities associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates <33 weeks gestation; and 2) to identify and characterize butyrate-producing bacteria associated with intestinal permeability in preterm neonates during the first 7-10 days of life. At the completion of the study, we will determine the biomarkers associated with healthy intestinal barrier functions and the discriminatory scheme for accurate classification of high or low IP group. Our long-term goal is to conduct a randomize clinical trial of rationally designed intervention for NEC early prevention. Refinement of the screening tool will identify infants with aberrant leaky gut, an essential prerequisite for subsequent rational design of novel strategies such as clinical trials of probiotics to promote healthy intestinal barrier functions to reduce NEC incidence. PROJECT NARRATIVE ""Leaky gut"", is the proximate cause of susceptibility to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening, gastrointestinal emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. This proposal will develop and validate a rapid, non-invasive screening test incorporating microbiome-based markers and associated neonatal factors, to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. The results of this study will support clinical trials aimed to optimize intestinal maturation and to reduce the burden of NEC complications. This study will address major knowledge gaps of the intestinal microenvironment in preterm infants, and ultimately lead to improved strategies to manage neonatal gastrointestinal health, improve children’s health and quality of life, all which are within the mission of NIDDK.",Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants,9872417,R21DK123674,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anabolism', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Butyrates', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epithelial', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Milk', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lactulose', 'Lead', 'Leaky Gut', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Necrosis', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Pyruvate', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Urine', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'early screening', 'feeding', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mucosal microbiota', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sex', 'stool sample', 'sugar', 'supervised learning', 'therapy design']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2019,231750,0.016535577376142127
"Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism Project Summary/Abstract According to the latest estimates, over 1 in 7 Americans will develop an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) over the course of their lifetime, and alcohol consumption is involved in nearly 4% of deaths worldwide. Thus, AUDs represent a significant public health concern. Currently, the best pharmacotherapies for AUDs require the treatment of 10 patients to observe 1 patient reduce drinking to healthy levels. For this reason, one appealing option is to identify at-risk individuals before they become heavy drinkers; for instance a family history of alcoholism is currently among the best predictors of AUD. Adolescence presents an ideal period to study these factors as it precedes the onset of AUDs but is also a time when there is a rapid increase in consumption. We have recently shown that neuroimaging measures can be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. relapse), suggesting it would also be possible to develop neuroimaging as a predictor of onset of heavy drinking in adolescents. Developing predictive tools to identify adolescents likely to progress to heavy drinking would offer the opportunity for early intervention and could potentially reduce the progression to AUD. Substantial evidence suggests that primary motives for problematic drinking are to enhance positive valence and reduce negative valence emotions. Further, substance use disorders are associated with altered activity in the insula, ventral striatum, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex when processing potential rewards and aversive outcomes. We hypothesize that individuals at risk for AUDs will show heightened response to aversive stimuli in the anterior insula and amygdala and heightened response to rewarding stimuli in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. We further hypothesize that they will exhibit diminished functional connectivity between reward, salience, and executive control networks. To test this, we will recruit 70 adolescents aged 18–20. Half will be have a biological parent with an AUD. The other half will be a control group matched on current drinking levels, age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All participants will undergo a functional MRI scan with a resting state run and a run during a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task that includes the risk of hearing an aversive sound (i.e. a loud scream). All participants will be followed for 6 months after the scan to determine levels of drinking. This study will provide both mechanistic information on risk for AUD as well as a tool to identify adolescents at greatest risk prior to the onset of problem drinking. This information could help provide personalized information about risk that may maximize likelihood of AUD prevention. In addition to the research goals described above, this is a training proposal that is designed to facilitate the transition of the primary investigator, Dr. Joshua Gowin, from mentored post-doctoral research fellow to independent, tenure-track research faculty at an academic institution. The mentored phase of the proposal will use a multifaceted training plan to improve Dr. Gowin’s knowledge base as well as his research and professional skillsets. Specifically, Dr. Gowin will learn new techniques in resting state functional connectivity analysis and in the cognitive neuroscience of emotion regulation. In addition to this scientific training, Dr. Gowin will gain experience management, teaching, and data presentation. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gowin has assembled a team of advisors from the intra- and extramural community with expertise in these areas to guide his training and development. This committee will include Dr. Vijay Ramchandani-NIAAA, Dr. Monique Ernst-NIMH, Dr. Elliot Stein-NIDA, and Dr. Susan Tapert-UCSD (see letters of support). The skills that will be developed during the mentored phase will position Dr. Gowin for success as he applies for an independent position and establishes his own research program. Project Narrative  Alcohol use disorders will affect over one in 10 Americans over the course of their lifetime. The early identification of individuals at greatest risk may provide opportunities to educate or provide services that mitigate individual risk. Therefore, identifying risk factors for alcohol use disorders is an important goal for researchers. One emerging target for research involves using functional MRI to study brain systems that contribute to risk. This project will explore the neural correlates of positive and negative valence emotional processing and how they contribute to risk for the development of alcohol use disorders. Better understanding of these neural processes could inform us about how alcohol use disorders emerge and, importantly, how we might prevent them.",Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism,9772202,R00AA024778,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcoholism', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Extramural Activities', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Loudness', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Review Literature', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Targeted Research', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'aged', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'faculty research', 'financial incentive', 'follow-up', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'negative affect', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'predicting response', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'underage drinking']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2019,249000,-0.05385243712363126
"Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rare monogenic forms of common diseases have provided key fundamental insights about common disease. However, genetic, environmental, and stochastic elements influence risk for disease. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant disorder afflicting 1 in 250 linked to severe increases in LDL cholesterol and premature coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, is an ideal model to characterize modifiers of disease. Despite the presence of a strong genetic driver of hypercholesterolemia from FH mutations, we recently observed that half do not have the expected severe hypercholesterolemia. In this proposal, we outline several methods to discover and dissect the genetic and non-genetic factors influencing CHD risk conferred by FH mutations in humans and determine whether knowledge of these factors can improve risk discrimination among those with FH mutations. Our approach harnesses several multi-dimensional datasets: whole genome sequences, metabolomics, and cross-sectional and longitudinal cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will aggregate and curate 75,000 deep (30X) whole genome sequences and cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will discover genetic and non-genetic modifiers of LDL cholesterol and CHD risk in FH and evaluate their metabolomic consequences. In Aim 3, we will develop a method incorporating genetics and longitudinal non- genetic exposures for CHD risk stratification among ~4,000 with FH mutations in the Million Veteran Program. In addition to the proposed Aims, this five-year proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy for the principal investigator's (PI's) scientific and professional development in academic cardiovascular medicine. The research strategy builds upon the PI's prior research experience and clinical training. In addition to an undergraduate degree in Molecular Biology and master's degree in Biomedical Informatics, he completed post- graduate medical training in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Medicine. He recently developed a new preventive/genetic cardiology clinic focusing on the evaluation and management of those with or a family history of premature CHD, including those with FH, at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills in human genetics and genomics into new domains: integrative genomics, statistical genetics, clinical informatics, and risk modeling. The career development goals will be at achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentorship, collaboration, didactic coursework, conferences, and scientific investigation. This work will take place in a unique training environment comprised of MGH and the Broad Institute. Successful completion of this career development award will result in improved fundamental understanding of the determinants of CHD, result in the PI's transition to an independent physician-scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for R01-level funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cardiovascular disease, largely due to coronary heart disease (CHD), remains the leading cause of death in the United States and now worldwide despite current advances. Familial hypercholesterolemia is a relative common genetic disorder characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia and premature CHD but many carrying these mutations do not develop these consequences. This proposal seeks to define and characterize the factors modifying CHD risk among those with FH mutations; success has the potential to broadly identify new mechanisms of CHD and novel strategies for prevention.",Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model,9609507,K08HL140203,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Amish', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Biochemical', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family history of', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Mutation', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Massachusetts', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'heart disease risk', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'next generation', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'premature', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'trait', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2019,170003,-0.021109734431446096
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this ﬁeld typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind admis- sion risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modiﬁable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital ad- missions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classiﬁcation models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to signiﬁcantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close men- toring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a support- ive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identiﬁcation and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,9505570,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'collaborative environment', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'trend', 'trial design']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2018,195205,0.010059440125632745
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9442890,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,794994,0.01132608348114026
"Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes ABSTRACT Diabetic patients are at risk of developing diabetic heart disease, which may lead to complications in care. Diabetic heart disease patients not only have exceptionally high healthcare expenditures and resource utilization but also are likely to have poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that early intervention of patients likely to develop diabetic heart disease is cost-effective and yields favorable health outcomes. Therefore, early identiﬁcation of diabetic patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease is crucial to provide effective interventions. The commonly accepted methodology for diabetic heart disease risk prediction is the use of one or more risk scoring systems. However, these risk functions may not generalize well for the diabetes patient and may suffer from poor calibration when used on different cohorts. Moreover, the scoring systems have only been studied on coronary heart disease, one variant of diabetic heart disease while heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy remain important, yet insufﬁciently studied problems. Machine learning offers the ability to perform accurate predictive analytics and has been proposed as a way to identify and manage high-risk patients. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a high-impact and practical risk prediction model that can be used to per- form early identiﬁcation of high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of patient information in electronic health records, the model needs to capitalize on the multi-dimensional temporal nature of pa- tient records to extract identifying characteristics of patients that will develop diabetic heart disease. To accomplish this, we will leverage modern machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization and natural language processing to model complex patient characteristics, provide a more complete representation of the patient, and uncover excellent predictors of diabetic heart disease risk. An existing dataset that contains the de-identiﬁed electronic health records of approximately 4,100 diabetic patients from the Emory Healthcare System to compare the predictive power of machine learning-based algorithms with the standard risk scoring systems. These algorithms will be evaluated on calibration, discrimination, and ease of interpretability. The results of this work will provide insight as to how to develop a machine learning–based prediction system that can identify high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. The study may also shed light on the best approaches for fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources to build a better predictive model and potentially identify novel indicators of high- risk diabetic heart disease factors. Moreover, the work will help inform a larger multi-site study of diabetic heart disease risk prediction and develop methods to generalize the results to a broader spectrum of comorbidities. This project is consistent with the National Library of Medicine's mission to translate biomedical research into practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic patients are risk of developing diabetic heart disease which can lead to high healthcare expenditure, high resource utilization, and poor patient outcomes. Existing diabetic risk prediction models can suffer from poor calibration and predictive accuracy.

"Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients Failure to rescue (FTR), a nurse-sensitive national metric of health care quality, refers to death of a hospitalized patient from a treatable complication, and is potentiated by failure to recognize and appropriately respond to early signs of complications. There is a paucity of research examining patient features predictive of FTR complications. Such information could shift the current paradigm of nursing surveillance to earlier recognition, prevention and treatment of FTR complications, thereby saving lives. New-onset venous thromboembolism (VTE), an FTR complication occurring as either a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE), is the leading cause of preventable hospital death, carrying a high risk of mortality and a national cost burden of $7 billion annually. VTE is a complex disease process involving interactions between clinical risk factors and acquired and/or inherited susceptibilities to thrombosis. Although biomarkers and clinical factors associated with VTE have been identified, clinical manifestations are subtle, presenting gradually over hours to days. Current VTE risk assessment models (RAM), the cornerstone of prevention, have limited utility due to their complexity and lack of reliability, generalizability and external validation. A critical gap in VTE risk modeling research is that while new-onset VTE pathology evolves over the course of hospitalization, no current models incorporate the progressive accrual of dynamic patient data and pattern evolution over time in their modeling approaches. The totality of routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data is massive in terms of volume, variety, and production at a rapid velocity in real-time. Such big data could be used in machine learning (ML) analytic approaches to process time series clinical data to identify subtle, evolving feature patterns predictive of new-onset VTE and address this gap. This study proposes to assemble a large scale, multi-source, multi-dimensional VTE study dataset, and in tandem, systematically define the EHR data elements associated with a new-onset VTE diagnosis for computable phenotype algorithm development. We will then apply machine learning analytic approaches to baseline and accruing intensive time series clinical data in the curated dataset to develop models identifying data patterns and features predictive of dynamically evolving new-onset VTE in adult hospitalized patients. This proposal aligns with NINR’s strategic vision for nurse scientists to employ new strategies for collecting and analyzing complex big data sets to permit better understanding of the biological underpinnings of health, and improve ways nurses prevent and manage illness. This innovative study and individualized training plan under a strong and well- established team, represents initial steps in the applicant’s research trajectory focused on data science approaches to predict FTR complication risk, and develop, implement and test dynamic RAMs to inform targeted prevention and treatment decisions. Discovering new knowledge informing real-time decision making, nursing surveillance practices and care delivery systems can improve nurse sensitive patient outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of preventable hospital death. This study first proposes to develop a reproducible computable phenotype definition for new-onset VTE cohort ascertainment from the electronic health record, and then develop dynamic models for VTE risk assessment through the application of machine learning algorithms to massive electronic health record clinical data repositories. Such models can inform the mechanisms underlying this complex disease and identify subtle pattern changes in a patient’s condition forecasting a VTE event, enabling earlier nurse identification and intervention, and decreasing the development of complications and failure to rescue in hospitalized patients.",Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients,9610301,F31NR018102,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Quality of Care', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Vision', 'base', 'care delivery', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'prevent']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2018,44524,0.012287541583472686
"Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment Postoperative complications and readmissions rates are higher in minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) patients. Low SES is associated with frailty, one of the best predictors of 30-day postoperative complications and early hospital readmission. Despite their influence on health outcomes, frailty and social risk factors are not considered in risk adjustment for reimbursement and quality measures. CMS developed financial incentive- based programs to improve quality of care. Yet this strategy disproportionately penalizes minority-serving, major teaching and safety net hospitals (SNH), further constraining resources for the care of vulnerable populations. Our long-term goal is to use frailty and social risk factors to identify at-risk patients to design more effective clinical care pathways. Frailty can be derived retrospectively using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) dataset. Data networks are powerful research tools that can be used to answer important questions. However, extracting data from EHR is challenging. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) developed 13 Clinical Data Research Networks (CDRN) that have considerable overlapping membership with Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) institutions. While steady progress has been made, multiple barriers exist to efficiently access and use data. We will engage 3 CTSA hubs, each members of a different CDRN, to locally merge identified datasets developing data accessing and linking strategies at diverse institutions for dissemination across sites within CDRNs and to ultimately perform similar studies across CDRNs. We will use the SMART IRB reliance platform to harmonize the regulatory approval process as much as possible for each step of this project to identify barriers to use in data networks. We propose the following Aims: 1) Determine the predictive power of ethnicity, race, SES, and frailty for postoperative complications, mortality  and readmissions to improve risk adjustment at 3 CTSA/CDRNs 2) Estimate postoperative functional status using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning  algorithms on inpatient physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and nursing notes for ACS NSQIP  patients to predict long-term functional status 3) Develop methods to predict long-term loss of independence after major surgery 4) Determine hospital resource utilization stratified by SES, frailty and minority status The significance of our study is the incorporation of social risk factors, frailty and functional status in risk adjustment forming the basis for future interventions by targeting patients at the highest risk for postoperative complications and reducing health care disparities. Our innovative approach harnesses data sources at diverse institutions with the goal of disseminating these methods across 3 CDRNs and the CTSA network. Project Narrative: Patients with social risk factors, including poverty, being a minority, lack of an education and frailty are all associated with having worse health outcomes and with more difficulties recovering after surgical procedures. Safety net hospitals take care of many people with social risk factors and are being judged on the quality of care provided without accounting for the challenges faced by poor people. We will study the effect of social risk factors and frailty on health outcomes after surgery to identify patients that would benefit from care pathways that help poor and/or frail people.","Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment",9528240,U01TR002393,"['Accounting', 'Admission activity', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Community Surveys', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physical therapy', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic data', 'financial incentive', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'member', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'payment', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'readmission rates', 'safety net', 'simulation', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,U01,2018,100000,0.044029561234000085
"Use of a machine learning framework to predict severe maternal morbidity Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) is on the rise in the United States. Such morbidity is accompanied by delivery complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and can have long- term health consequences for women. To date, only a handful of studies examined risk factors for SMM in the United States, and even fewer considered the site of delivery care as potentially influencing SMM occurrence. This study will test the use of machine learning techniques to develop models for predicting women’s risk of experiencing SMM. We will use population-based data from a family of Maryland state databases linked with American Hospital Association Annual Survey data for the 2010-2014 period. Our primary analytic sample will be comprised of all delivery hospitalizations in Maryland hospitals during 2010-2014. Two SMM outcome measures will be employed: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s SMM algorithm, and a composite measure that includes any of the codes in the CDC SMM algorithm, ICU admission and/or blood transfusion during the delivery hospitalization. Separately for each of the two outcome measures, we will first develop multi-stage least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) models to predict SMM and then employ Multiple Additive Regression Tree to maximize the predictive ability of the LASSO models. Next, we will fit Logit regression models for SMM adjusting for LASSO-selected predictor variables and compare LASSO and Logit models’ performance using standard metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve of receiver operator characteristic. The proposal has several areas of innovation. Classical analytics tools are not well suited to capture the full value of large data. In contrast, machine learning techniques are unconstrained by preset statistical assumptions and expected to make predictions with higher degrees of accuracy. The success of this pilot study will open up new avenues of study into the potential for machine learning to aid clinical care. Obstetrics is one of the areas that can greatly benefit from its use by predicting maternal risks early and optimizing pathways to the best possible outcomes for women and their newborns. Identifying key predictors of SMM can serve to ascertain health disparities, strengths and weaknesses in obstetric care, and prevent adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Severe maternal morbidity is on the rise in the United States and such morbidity can have long- term health consequences for women. This study will assess the potential use of new statistical methods, not currently employed in obstetrics, to develop prediction models for severe maternal morbidity during the delivery hospitalization. Our ability to predict a woman’s risk of developing severe maternal morbidity can help prevent such morbidity from occurring. !",Use of a machine learning framework to predict severe maternal morbidity,9506935,R03HD095057,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Surgical Procedures', 'American Hospital Association', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Behavior', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Event', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Logit Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'care delivery site', 'care seeking', 'clinical care', 'delivery complications', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal morbidity', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neonatal outcome', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'stillbirth', 'success']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2018,81875,0.016071518936120893
"Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings Project Summary (Abstract) With little change in incidence for over 50 years, pneumonia remains the top cause for morbid hospitalization1 in the USA, and is associated with healthcare costs exceeding $10 billion annually2. This study proposes to mine big data captured in an intergrated medical/dental record (iEHR) and enterprise data warehouse (EDW) of a large midwestern medical-dental integrated healthcare system and will test the hypothesis that poor oral health is an independent risk for subtypes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Proposed specific aims include: 1) electronic identification and characterization of pneumonia types and 2) evaluation of the association of oral health status with risk of pneumonia. Tasks to achieve study aims are to: a) develop electronic, phenotype-based algorithm(s) to classify and characterize pneumonia by subtype and relative frequency of events; b) characterize impact of immediate and longitudinal oral health status on emergent pneumonia stratified by subtype; and c) evaluate relative risk contributed by medical and dental factors. Innovative application of natural language processing (NLP) to support evaluation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML) to identify as-yet unknown potential risk factors is proposed. These aims will be accomplished by established investigators including dentists and researchers with extensive research track records in oral and systemic health including pneumonia, clinical pulmonologist/intensivist to provide clinical expertise to inform data mining, biomedical informaticians with expertise in data mining, ML and NLP and data modeling, and experienced biostatisticians who will apply appropriate statistical approaches and traditional data modeling to big data. This team will collaboratively create and deliver a unique, well-defined, pneumonia- specific, oral health data registry resource and validated phenotype-based algorithm to classify pneumonia, stratified by subtypes, which will support future interrogation for additional permutations of medical and dental factors. Study outcomes are expected to leverage immediate translational value within the health system with high potential for relevance and portability to other settings. The project is expected to define risk factors which may represent actionable targets for reduction of pneumonia risk across various settings. Project Narrative- Relevance to public health: Pneumonia continues as a leading public health problem in hospitals, healthcare facilities and community settings. Pneumonia is the top disease-related cause for hospitalization. This study proposes to use data in electronic health records to classify pneumonia type and describe risk factors that may make individual susceptible to different types of pneumonia, including impact of diseases of the mouth, gums and teeth. The project expects to create models that can identify patients at risk for pneumonia based on information in their medical record so that those risks may be recognized and reduced.",Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings,9599192,R03DE027020,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Climate', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Hygiene', 'Dental Records', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Mouth Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nosocomial pneumonia', 'Oral', 'Oral health', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Periodontitis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal vaccine', 'Pneumonia', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Ventilator', 'Visit', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'case finding', 'clinically relevant', 'community setting', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outreach', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'pneumonia model', 'portability', 'secondary analysis', 'systems research', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia']",NIDCR,MARSHFIELD CLINIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION,R03,2018,174917,0.02508727611147618
"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9544317,K01MH106710,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Surveys', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric epidemiology', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Self-Administered', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stressful Event', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'salivary assay', 'secondary analysis', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),K01,2018,164330,0.028468679686890954
"Developing data tools to reduce CVD disparities via Health Information Exchanges ABSTRACT CVD disparities across the race/ethnic and socioeconomic gradients are exacerbated by barriers to receiving guideline-based primary or secondary preventive treatment—such as appropriate blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes treatment.1–6 Most patients not receiving guideline-based treatment are actually insured and have seen a primary care provider in the past year.1 To reduce CVD disparities by better targeting disease prevention and treatment, healthcare administrators and county departments of public health have begun pooling data resources across healthcare and public health systems—such as across clinics, emergency rooms and hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories, and administrative datasets.7–9 The idea behind pooling such datasets is to better identify persons most in need, and direct targeted interventions to them. Solano County, California, a medium-sized, diverse, low-income county, has developed one of the first, and most comprehensive health information exchanges (HIEs), including: (i) electronic health record data from all emergency rooms, hospitals, primary care and specialty clinics and care facilities in the county; (ii) labs from all laboratory service providers; (iii) prescription details from all pharmacies; (iv) validated social determinants of health surveys administered in clinics; and (v) administrative datasets, including welfare, disability, housing, and geocoded neighborhood features. While several other counties are following suit to develop large, secure HIEs across healthcare and public health systems, a key challenge remains: how to cheaply, accurately, and rapidly analyze HIEs to identify which persons should be targeted for interventions. Without reliable, user- friendly, cost-effective, and generalizable data analysis programs, counties are unable to use the massive data at their disposal to address preventable causes of morbidity and mortality. The objective of this application is to apply our unique machine-learning innovations to develop open-source programs that can enable counties to identify persons at high risk for preventable CVD events and deaths. We will test the hypothesis that electronic health record data alone are insufficient to provide accurate risk prediction for preventable CVD events and deaths. Rather, we believe that key survey and administrative data providing information on social determinants of health will improve identification of high-risk patients. To test our hypothesis, we will develop and validate open-source, generalizable programs to: (Aim 1) rapidly identify persons in need of improved primary and secondary prevention of CVD by systematically comparing the performance of three alternative machine learning approaches to read HIE data, as compared to human clinician chart reviewers; and (Aim 2) perform multi-level risk assessment by automatically calibrating and validating models of CVD event risk, utilization and cost to HIE data, to identify the added value of administrative and social determinants data as compared to clinical or claims-based data alone. Our work will produce generalizable software tools for counties across the country to analyze HIE data and reduce preventable CVD disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities are exacerbated by inadequate guideline-based treatment of CVD risk factors. Furthermore, risk adjustment models currently used to target interventions and pay for healthcare services only use claims-based data such as demographics and clinical diagnostic codes, ignoring social determinants of health. Our research will rigorously develop and test novel machine learning methods that incorporate social determinants data from large Health Information Exchanges, producing novel data tools that will enable health systems nationwide to better detect individuals who could use improvements in their preventive therapy for CVD, and improve risk adjustment models to identify persons at high risk for preventable healthcare utilization and cost.",Developing data tools to reduce CVD disparities via Health Information Exchanges,9584874,R21MD012867,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Blood Pressure', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Case Management', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Surveys', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Neighborhoods', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Primary Health Care', 'Primary Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Secure', 'Social Work', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Unemployment', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular disorder therapy', 'care providers', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disorder prevention', 'health care service', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'payment', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'residence', 'safety net', 'semiparametric', 'service providers', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'treatment disparity', 'user-friendly', 'welfare']",NIMHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,229089,0.03566317608086192
"Prediction of short-term risk of coronary heart disease and overall risk of ischemic cardiomyopathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the United States, although mortality from CHD has declined over recent decades, the incidence of CHD has remained high. This year, nearly 600,000 Americans will experience their first myocardial infarction (MI) and a larger number will have undiagnosed ischemia. Both groups are at risk of developing ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), which compounds the burden of morbidity and mortality they face. Efforts to prevent CHD and its complications like ICM have been hampered by poor patient adherence, which is in large part due to misperceptions of risk. Patients are more likely to engage in preventive behaviors if they know their risk of disease, particularly if their risk is imminent. However, although several models estimate long-term risk of CHD over the next 10 years, there are no established models for predicting short-term risk of CHD within a one year time frame. Likewise, among patients with CHD, there are no existing models to assess the overall risk of coexisting ICM. To address these knowledge gaps in the field, I will build robust prediction models by applying the latest machine learning algorithms to the recently available large datasets comprising the UK Biobank and the Veterans Affairs (VA) cohorts.  In Aim 1, I will examine the 477,000 UK Biobank participants without preexisting CHD to develop a prediction model for one-year risk of new onset CHD. I will use several different machine learning algorithms, compare their respective predictive performances, and select the best-performing and most clinically applicable model. I will also compare the risk classification ability of this new model with existing long-term risk prediction models such as the Framingham and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) risk scores.  In Aim 2, I will apply machine learning techniques to a large VA patient cohort consisting of over 300,000 patients with known coronary anatomy and left ventricular systolic function to develop a prediction model for the presence of ICM. In light of the two primary mechanisms for ischemic cardiomyopathy, irreversible myocyte loss from MI and hibernating myocardium from chronic ischemia, I will perform a stratified analysis by history of prior MI to determine if the risk factors for ICM vary depending on whether the pathological mechanism is infarction versus ischemia.  An improved understanding of the predictors of CHD and ICM will lead to insights into the biological basis of ischemic heart disease. Moreover, accurate identification of individuals who are at imminent risk for CHD and its complication, ICM, is of central importance to efforts in preventing cardiovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary heart disease and its complications such as ischemic cardiomyopathy are the global leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and an improved ability to assess risk along this continuum of ischemic heart disease is urgently needed. I will apply the latest machine learning techniques to the recently available large datasets comprising the UK Biobank and VA cohorts to develop robust prediction models for short-term risk of coronary heart disease and overall risk of ischemic cardiomyopathy.

"Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA): Prediction and Prevention Project Summary: The recent advances in information technologies and biotechnologies is an opportunity to substantially improve healthcare. To exploit the power of data to benefit patients, however, effective clinical decision support tools and novel, individualized interventions must be designed, tested, and implemented. Although there has been progress in the development of statistical/machine learning methods, numerous challenges remain to tailor and translate them into useful clinical decision support tools. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) accounts for 15-20% of all adult deaths and is the industrial world’s leading cause of death. Clinical studies of SCA produce repeated measures on risk factors and multiple different kinds of events over time. We refer to these data as survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) data. In this project, we will develop novel statistical learning methods for SLAM data and apply them to two distinct aspects of the SCA problem. First, we propose to develop novel statistical learning algorithms that better predict an individual’s multivariate longitudinal data with a focus on the risk of first and subsequent SCA. Second, we propose to develop micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs to reduce behavioral risk factors for SCA among persons at high risk. The methods that we propose to develop will be applicable in many areas of medicine. However, they are motivated by and applied to SCA in this project. Our team has expertise in statistics including causal inference, longitudinal data and survival analyses, plus machine learning, epidemiology, cardiology, and behavioral interventions through mobile health (mHealth). This proposed collaboration has the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and test statistical learning tools for real-time risk prediction of survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) outcome data. Aim 2: Estimate the risk of SCA and its dependence on dynamic modifiable and non-modifiable factors in population-based and clinical cohorts. Aim 3: Plan and conduct a feasibility-usability study of micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs for behavioral change to reduce SCA risk. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have contributed to the progress of healthcare delivery through the application of computational statistics to medicine. ! ! Project Narrative: Although sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the industrial world’s leading cause of death, SCA prediction and prevention strategies remain limited. In this project, we contribute towards addressing the global burden of SCAs through the development of novel statistical/machine learning methods for SCA risk prediction and the design of mobile health (mHealth) interventions for risk reduction. While developed in the context of SCA, these methods will be applicable in many areas of medicine and public health. !",Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA): Prediction and Prevention,9540118,F30HL142131,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Information Technology', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'career', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'time use', 'tool', 'trial design', 'usability']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,49524,0.03955801368028107
"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief.

"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9475874,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'coronary artery calcium', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'routine imaging', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,653101,0.003559323604846412
"Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) includes serious threats to maternal health and survival that occur at delivery or postpartum. SMM, which includes postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, sepsis, and other serious conditions, can be life-threatening and have long-term effects on a woman’s health as well as adversely impact her infant’s health and well-being. Over the past 15 years, the prevalence of SMM has doubled in the U.S., currently affecting more than 65,000 women each year. Additionally, the prevalence of SMM is highest in women of minority races and ethnicities, particularly women who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. However, the most important risk factors for SMM are not established and it is unknown what is contributing to racial/ethnic disparities and increasing trends in SMM. Our goal is to improve the understanding of SMM and its risk factors to provide evidence that supports efforts to reduce the prevalence of SMM and racial/ethnic disparities in SMM. The proposed project will use linked vital statistics, patient discharge, and U.S. Census data for over 4 million births in California from 2007 to 2014. We will test trends in SMM prevalence and calculate the population attributable risks for three key potential risk factors—advanced maternal age, prepregnancy obesity, and cesarean delivery—and their combination across the years of study (Aim 1). Additionally, we will examine a wide range of potential risk factors to identify those that are most important using a machine-learning/data-adaptive approach (Aim 2). Both study aims will be done in the overall sample and separately in racial/ethnic groups. Understanding SMM trends and determining the strongest predictors of SMM are critical steps to launch forward research of this pressing and understudied public health problem. Many factors may present crucial opportunities to prevent the development severe maternal morbidity—saving the lives of mothers and helping ensure a healthy future for their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year, more and more new mothers are diagnosed with serious pregnancy-related medical conditions, particularly mothers who identify as racial/ethnic minorities. Research is urgently needed to understand what is driving this alarming problem and what puts women most at risk so future research can be conducted to guide interventions and clinical care for childbearing women.","Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities",9485199,F32HD091945,"['Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Age', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patient Discharge', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Population Study', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Vital Statistics', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'advanced maternal age', 'base', 'child bearing', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic minority population', 'improved', 'indexing', 'maternal morbidity', 'outcome prediction', 'prepregnancy', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'social', 'trend']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,58392,0.03053877721296504
"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988.

"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma.

"Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Title: Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Project Summary  Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. Risk assessment of influenza viruses is a key component in pandemic influenza preparedness (PIP), and it can help optimize resources for influenza surveillance, vaccine development and other control measurements to help minimize losses due to an emerging influenza virus. Risk assessment of influenza viruses includes emergence risk and public health impact of novel influenza viruses. Emergence risk assesses the probability for a novel influenza virus to infect and easily spread among humans; it is the first risk to be evaluated in risk assessment.  Although a number of individual mutations or structural/functional motifs have been reported to be associated with influenza infection and transmission, their effects on emergence risk are difficult to predict a priori. Thus, conventional methods for assessment of the emergence risk of a novel IAV often require laboratory generation of reassortants and subsequent measurement of their infectivity, pathogenesis, and transmission, which is often done in a mammalian system. However, this strategy can lead to laboratory mutants with gain of function (i.e., mutants with new or enhanced activity on pathogenesis and/or transmissibility in mammals). Thus, an ideal system for influenza risk assessment should be able to quantify emergence risk for a novel IAV solely by using genomic sequences.  Avian influenza A viruses facilitated the emergence of all four known pandemic human influenza A viruses: the hemagglutinin genes of 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemic viruses are all of avian origin, and the polymerase PB2 and PA genes of the 2009 pandemic virus are of avian origin. Risk assessment of potential reassortants from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses has been a key component of the pandemic influenza preparedness process.  The objectives of this study are to develop and validate a machine learning method to assess the emergence risk for a novel IAV using genomic sequences. The study will focus on emergence risk from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses. We expect to identify genetic features within and across gene segments and ascertain their synergistic effects as emergence risk determinants. We also expect to develop a computational model for estimating the probability of a possible reassortant to emerge, given the genomic sequences of one human influenza virus and one avian influenza virus. The study results should help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and with assessing emergence risk of influenza virus; thus, the results should facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness. Project Narrative This project will develop a computational model for influenza risk assessment, and it will help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and for assessing the emergence risk of influenza viruses, and thus the project will facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness.",Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses,9599007,R21AI135820,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Birds', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Funding', 'Gene Combinations', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Information Theory', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Reassortant Viruses', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'cost', 'enzootic', 'flu transmission', 'gain of function', 'genetic variant', 'in vivo', 'influenza surveillance', 'influenzavirus', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'pandemic influenza', 'transmission process', 'vaccine development', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,181875,0.038774862204128145
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9534732,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,550853,0.03331554683564096
"MyHealthyPregnancy mobile health app: Combining behavioral science and machine learning for risk communication during the peripartum period Project Summary/Abstract Background: Preterm births, those that occur prior to 37 weeks of gestation, are the leading direct cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. More than 1 in 9 births in the U.S. are preterm, with rates that are disproportionately high among African-Americans and families living in poverty, regardless of race. Addressing the problem of preterm birth requires both accurate identification of the factors that put women at risk, and communication of that risk to women and their healthcare providers. The reduction in preterm births is a core mission of the NICHD Pregnancy and Perinatology Branch. Study aims: 1) Apply our novel machine learning algorithm, KCI-neighbors, to a large prospective cohort study to model adverse pregnancy outcomes among women with low income and English literacy, 2) use mixed-methods research, grounded in decision science techniques, to tailor the MyHealthyPregnancy (MHP) app to the specific needs of low income and low English literacy patients, and 3) conduct small- scale usability testing of the modified technology with a sample of peripartum low-income, low-literacy patients to determine the app's acceptability and interested in targeted intervention strategies. Innovation: MHP is the first mobile health app that combines machine learning, expert models, and behavioral decision research to provide pregnant women and their providers scientifically sound, highly personalized, and actionable feedback on individual-level risk. The machine learning algorithms are designed to learn from users as the app is more widely deployed, allowing for the identification of new causal pathways linking risk factors to adverse pregnancy outcomes. MHP targets specific engagement metrics (e.g. appointment attendance) to meet health system stakeholders' goals, enabling healthcare systems to meet performance targets, as well as decrease costs through reduced adverse outcomes. Methodology and expected results: We will employ statistical machine learning to model the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, complemented by qualitative mixed-methods research to identify the most important measures to include in the MHP app. We anticipate that usability-testing will show an engaging app, capable of capturing and communicating risks in our target population. Potential impact: This work will advance scientific understanding of the risk factors, needs, and implementation science required to reach pregnant women who experience the most difficulty engaging in the healthcare system. Moreover, it will help improve clinical practice through development of a tool, MHP, that can detect and communicate preterm birth precursor risk to both patients and providers. Project Narrative Preterm birth affects millions of families in the United States, with severe health consequences for surviving infants and their families. Determining the factors that put individual women at greatest risk, and communicating those factors in a decision-relevant manner, requires a deep understanding of the patient population. The proposed research integrates individual-level interviews from women in a low income and low English literacy population, with novel statistical machine learning algorithms and a user-centered design approach, to deliver a personalized, engaging, and effective pregnancy risk communication mobile health application: MyHealthyPregnancy.",MyHealthyPregnancy mobile health app: Combining behavioral science and machine learning for risk communication during the peripartum period,9681309,R43DP006417,[' '],NCCDPHP,"NAIMA HEALTH, LLC",R43,2018,224843,0.038160676861669435
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,9393346,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency research', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinical implementation', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2018,163944,0.04717841291768421
"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser. The methods developed in this research proposal will not only further our understanding of DME but also generalize and enable future large-scale ophthalmic studies.",Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema,9574973,K23EY029246,"['Adopted', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Blindness', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundational Skills', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Centers', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Light Coagulation', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veterans', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Washington', 'bevacizumab', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'diabetes management', 'diabetic', 'epidemiology study', 'hands-on learning', 'health administration', 'intravitreal injection', 'laser photocoagulation', 'macula', 'macular edema', 'mortality', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapy outcome', 'traditional therapy', 'treatment optimization']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2018,237398,0.00981132485249269
"A Novel Probabilistic Methodology for Prediction of Emerging Diseases in Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment for people living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) currently accounts for an estimated 66 percent of the Nation's health care costs and will continue to grow. This mounting challenge has become a major public health issue since MCC is linked to suboptimal health outcomes and rising health care costs. However, it now known how MCC emerge among individuals or in the general population. Traditional epidemiological approaches have led to important findings of disease links and comorbidity associations. However, they are limited in their ability to characterize how patients acquire new chronic conditions and predict/personalize the emergence of MCC for individual patients. Objectives: This study will develop approaches that can be used to identify the most likely combinations of comorbidity within a population. These approaches can be tailored to examine MCC patterns in specific sub- populations or at the level of the individual patient. We will also study the effect of a large set of risk factors on MCC combinations emergence. Furthermore, we will use data mining approaches to predict and monitor the development of MCC combinations in at the population and individual levels. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that the emergence and progression of comorbidities in MCC patients form patterns that can be predicted and which are associated with prior medical conditions, demographic, and socio-economic characteristics. We further hypothesize that these methods can predict the timing and emergence of new chronic diseases more accurately by personalizing the records for individual patients. Aims and methodology: in Aim1, we will characterize how MCC emerge and progress in distinct patterns and how these patterns transition between different combinations of diseases over time. We will then identify and group major MCC transitions using the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm, which is a novel, efficient graphical approach to handle big data. In Aim 2, we will identify which risk factors are associated with MCC emergence using a machine learning approach that can handle the complex heterogeneity of comorbidity patterns. Risk factors include age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, economic status, marital status, and prior medical conditions. In Aim 3, we will use a similarity learning approach to develop models that can predict if MCC will emerge in individual patients or among populations and we will be able to use these models to monitor MCC emergence over time. Conclusion: Our findings will provide a foundation for future research that will evaluate specific treatment patterns associated with progression in MCC patterns and ultimately identify optimal time points of intervention for those with, or at risk for multiple chronic conditions. These findings will also provide information that can be used at the community level to manage healthcare resources to improve continuity and accessibility of care.

"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need.

"Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes Summary The objective of this proposal is to optimize the design and evaluate a robust artificial pancreas (R-AP) system for use in patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (T1D) with HbA1C greater than 8% and compare HbA1C outcomes in these patients relative to a decision support system that utilizes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. Although high risk patients have possibly the most to gain from usage of AP technology, they are oftentimes under-represented or excluded from clinical trials. This has been because of the increased risk of failure of these AP systems that were not designed to handle inconsistent reporting of meals, variable activity level, and infusion set failures. An AP system for high risk patients needs to be designed to achieve maximal benefit, including reducing the risk of acute and chronic complications. A major obstacle for enabling the AP for usage by high-risk patients is that these patients may be less compliant with use guidelines for the system including missed meal announcements, infrequent sensor calibrations, and prolonged infusion set wear leading to infusion set failures. In this grant, we will integrate new risk-mitigation features into the OHSU single-hormone AP to enable usage by high-risk patients that fall into the categories described above. We present new algorithms for automating the detection of missed meal announcements, missed calibrations, and robust handling of hybrid usage mode. While AP systems may be an optimal choice for improving glycemic control, many people with T1D prefer MDI therapy. Decision support systems such as the DailyDose decision support system developed at OHSU can be used to improve glycemic control for patients who prefer MDI therapy. The DailyDose decision support system is designed for CGM augmented MDI therapy. It enables on-demand calculation of insulin doses, automates insulin dose adjustments based on pattern recognition, and uses machine learning approaches to alert the patients to events such as predicted hypoglycemia and missed meal doses.The benefit of the DailyDose system is that it is a simple system and does not require use of an insulin pump, which may be a challenge for some patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes as pump therapy is more intensive and requires infusion set changes. It is unknown in this high risk group of people whether patient needs, quality of life, and glycemic control are best addressed with an AP system or decision support tool or if both treatments are appropriate. We have designed a 3-month clinical study to compare glycemic outcomes during AP vs. decision support interventions in a high- risk T1D cohort (HbA1C 8-10.5%), with the aim of demonstrating a significant clinically relevant reduction in HbA1C. Our hypothesis is that both AP and decision support therapies will decrease HbA1C relative to baseline but that the AP will provide further benefit over DailyDose. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. We propose to integrate features into the OHSU artificial pancreas to optimize it for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c>8-10.5%) and compare it to DailyDose, a decision support system that uses multiple daily injections.",Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes,9691740,R01DK120367,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Carbohydrates', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Distress', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modification', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'design', 'engineering design', 'expectation', 'falls', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'patient population', 'primary outcome', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'risk mitigation', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'support tools']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,591323,0.017736258519430035
"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",9593182,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Generic Drugs', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,466099,-0.01632931682354043
"Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT [ Pediatric specialists are often required to identify infants who are likely to suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcome, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is the most common developmental disability among children in the United States and results from several factors, including low weight for gestational age, premature birth, and stroke. Although MRI and cranial ultrasound (cUS) provide valuable structural information in the preterm period, they have moderate sensitivity to CP and require transportation of the infant. Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have validated the clinical potential of General Movement Assessment (GMA) for CP risk identification. During the early period, (23 weeks to 36 weeks gestational age), the presence of Cramped Synchronized General Movements (CSGMs), has demonstrated very high sensitivity and specificity for CP, conjointly ranging from 80%-98%. CSGMs are assessed while preterm infants are still in an acute care facility (NICU) and can inform the clinician independently, and in combination with cUS and MRI. Despite its potential, GMA is available in only a few clinical centers, as adoption and routine application depend on lengthy, cost-intensive observation and availability of specially trained raters. A Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) is proposed that will automate GMA for bedside evaluations in both preterm and postterm periods. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology not only for routine risk identification, but also for establishing disease trajectory and potentially differentiating CP subtypes and assessing efficacy of emerging treatments along the early developmental continuum.  Preliminary studies at UC Irvine have demonstrated that GMA analysis for CSGMs can be automated by quantifying infant limb movement using highly miniaturized, 3-axis wireless accelerometers and classifying CSGMs using a patented Markov-type approach that merges an application-specific Erlang-Cox state transition model with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (“EC-DBN”), treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling CSGM (and non-CSGM) duration and interval. In Phase I, this approach will be utilized in a comparative evaluation of two movement measurement modalities to determine which has the best overall performance and clinical utility at three leading NICU centers. Infant movement data will be concurrently acquired using an advanced, second generation prototype wireless accelerometer system (CPRIS-A) and a high definition 3D (infrared) optical camera (CPRIS-O). The optical modality offers significant potential advantages as it requires no infant contact and can monitor unattended, intermittently, over weeks or months. However, its potential for GMA automation must be systematically evaluated. Classifier results from both modalities will be compared to expert rater consensus in 80 preterm infants. The primary outcome will be CSGM identification accuracy, as determined by ROC-AUC analyses, with a threshold for success of 0.85. Additional comparative performance measures include reliability and practicability in the NICU environment. An Advisory Committee of experts in the fields of neonatology, pediatrics and cerebral palsy will evaluate project results and advise on the clinical potential of each modality. ] PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood, with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per 1000 in high-income countries. The overall project goal is to develop a computerized hardware-software system capable of identifying preterm infants at high risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP), based on the systematic identification of specific patterns of movement-derived features. The Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) will enable clinical staff with only minimal training to cost effectively implement General Movement Assessment (GMA) for Cramped Synchronous General Movements (CSGMs), with interpretive reporting performed automatically. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology for advancement in the identification, characterization and treatment assessment of CP.",Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System,9621149,R43NS098840,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Budgets', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Compromising', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Muscle Cramp', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neonatology', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'comparative', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'critical period', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'digital', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'heuristics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'limb movement', 'miniaturize', 'new technology', 'perinatal brain', 'postnatal period', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,"NEUROCOMP SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2018,300502,0.012250846138441263
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry. This research is expected to impact the clinical management of AAA disease, as well as the pre-surgical planning capabilities of vascular and endovascular aneurysm repair.",Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,9463479,R01HL121293,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Aneurysm', 'Award', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pressure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'recruit', 'repaired', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2018,398926,0.03513185418698715
"Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT The purpose of this K07 proposal is to provide Jeffrey Lee, MD, MAS with the protected time and resources to pursue the additional training needed to reach his long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator, focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality for CRC. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps (adenomas) and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. With limited data available in the literature to determine the appropriate timing and frequency of follow-up colonoscopy for patients after adenoma removal, recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance from our national guidelines have been imprecise at best. For example, the currently recommended range of 5-10 years for a surveillance colonoscopy for patients with a single adenoma covers a two-fold difference in exam frequency, with resultant two-fold impact on patient risk, cost, and colonoscopy capacity. To help optimize the timing of colonoscopic surveillance and guide appropriate utilization of this invasive and costly resource, stratification of CRC risk after colonoscopic polypectomy from a large community-based cohort with long-term follow-up is needed. Building on his prior work in CRC screening, Dr. Lee seeks to fill this knowledge gap by optimizing surveillance practices in post-polypectomy patients according to patient-, polyp-, and colonoscopy exam-related factors. Specifically, he will determine the long- term CRC risk in patients after colonoscopic polypectomy in a very large “real world” community-based population (Aim 1). He will also identify patient-, polyp-, and exam-related risk factors associated with incident CRC in these patients (Aim 2). Finally, he will develop a CRC risk prediction model that will identify post- polypectomy patients at high and low risk for developing subsequent CRC (Aim 3). To achieve these goals, Dr. Lee and his mentors have designed a career development plan for research and educational training to obtain: 1) knowledge and expertise in advanced epidemiologic methods for design and analysis of cohort studies; 2) knowledge in medical informatics methods; and 3) predictive modeling skills. To achieve the proposed research aims, Dr. Lee will leverage the rich electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large community-based healthcare system, in which data on patient, physician, colonoscopy, pathology, and CRC status have been collected since 1994. In addition, Dr. Lee will use an established natural language processing tool to efficiently collect data and evaluate potential confounding variables from more than 600,000 colonoscopy reports in order to address one of the main practical challenges that have limited the feasibility of large-scale population-based studies. Thus, completion of these aims has the potential to improve prevention and early detection of CRC, impact current surveillance guidelines for post-polypectomy patients, and reduce overuse and underuse of surveillance colonoscopy. Importantly, this proposal is realistic and feasible within the award period and will allow Dr. Lee to continue to build research skills, generate preliminary data, create additional collaborative relationships, and compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K07 award will support and accelerate the career development activities of Dr. Lee and allow him to successfully launch into the next phase of his career as an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized controlled trials have shown that screening reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. Thus in this proposal, we will determine the long-term risk and risk factors of CRC after colonoscopic polypectomy, and develop a CRC risk prediction model to tailor surveillancein post- polypectomy patients using a large, community-based cohort.","Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort",9543446,K07CA212057,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Polypectomy', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Premalignant', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scheme', 'Stratification', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Surveillance Program', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adenoma', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'skills', 'surveillance strategy', 'tool']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K07,2018,171720,0.04166201725213926
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed.

The focused didactic training, mentorship, and experiential learning through research activities proposed in this award will facilitate the development of critical skills in the pursuit of knowledge to inform and improve cancer prevention and screening. The candidate's research is motivated by the recognition that type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at a 30-40% increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), and that anti-diabetic drugs may also alter CRC risk. Thus, this high-risk group presents an opportunity for targeted screening and early detection of CRC. Currently, CRC screening is based on age and family history, with no consideration for comorbidities, including T2DM. Building on her previous work in cancer epidemiology, the candidate seeks to determine the association between T2DM and risk of colorectal polyps: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity, individually reflecting different molecular pathways (Aim 1); and to examine the risk for colorectal polyps associated with anti-diabetic therapy: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity (Aim 2). These aims will be addressed by leveraging the rich resources of an existing colonoscopy- based cohort at the University of Washington Medical Center's (UWMC) Gastroenterology clinic established during 2003-2011. Demographics, select lifestyle factors, and detailed histopathology have been previously abstracted from UWMC's electronic medical records (EMR) database. The candidate proposes to extend this cohort through 2017 (N~38,000), and enhance it by linking existing data with diabetes-related variables from the EMR database using biomedical informatics (e.g., natural language processing, clinical text mining) to estimate the risk for colorectal neoplasia. Using these empirical estimates derived from Aims 1 and 2, the candidate will then build a microsimulation model projecting the risk for colorectal neoplasia in T2DM patients, accounting for their diabetes therapy. Alternative screening and treatment strategies, including altering the screening start-age, modifying diabetes treatment, or altering screening modality among T2DM patients, will be evaluated for their cost-effectiveness (Aim 3). This work may help inform targeted screening recommendations that could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening. The candidate has proposed a training and career development plan that builds upon her prior skills in cancer epidemiology to gain experience and proficiency in biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation, including cost-effectiveness approaches. The transdisciplinary mentorship team, comprised of national and international experts, will provide the necessary expertise to ensure the success of this proposal, as well as facilitate the candidate's transition into an independent translational investigator in the field of cancer prevention and screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to determine the link between clinically diagnosed type-2 diabetes mellitus, use of anti-diabetic medications, and risk of colorectal polyp subtypes, including differences by lesion severity. Evaluating the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening among persons with type-2 diabetes may help inform targeted screening recommendations, which could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening.","Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia",9599316,K07CA222060,"['Accounting', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Award', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Models', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Family', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metformin', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Smoking History', 'Subgroup', 'Sulfonylurea Compounds', 'Testing', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer type', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'demographics', 'diabetes mellitus therapy', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'economic evaluation', 'experience', 'health economics', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'mortality', 'non-diabetic', 'personalized screening', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'text searching', 'translational scientist', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K07,2018,158153,0.010956516712414363
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9568354,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2018,58654,0.018219141229783027
"Infrared Eyes(iREyes) Infrared Eyes Abstract Eden Medical, Inc. is pleased to resubmit this Phase 2 SBIR proposal to develop the “Infrared Eyes” (iREyes) imager system, an affordable and powerful mobile health (mHealth) tool for healthcare. The hand-held iREyes system will acquire both thermal and visible spectrum imagery to quantify healing via thermal indexing methodology. The iREyes will offer a user-friendly product with automated categorization. Diabetic foot wounds are common, complex and costly. Foot areas that are likely to ulcerate are associated with increased local skin temperature due to inflammation and enzymatic autolysis of tissue. Inflammation is characterized by the cardinal signs including redness, swelling, and heat. In addition to identifying inflammation associated with healing, the iREyes will also identify hot spots associated with repetitive stress to reduce ulceration and re-ulceration risk for people in diabetic foot remission. The iREyes will directly quantify inflammation pathophysiology implementing a powerful revised two-part strategy: wound healing via regional foot index analysis and ulcer reoccurrence risk through temperature asymmetry threshold analysis. The combined thermal indexing for healing existing wounds and asymmetry predictive analysis represents a significant breakthrough over current practice.

"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,9523855,R01MH113622,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'laboratory experience', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'negative mood', 'network models', 'physical conditioning', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,594230,-0.015736097560569474
"Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 mo is considered the optimal form of nutrition for most newborns, yet many women experience substantial roadblocks in meeting this goal. One of the most common reason for  lactation cessation is mastitis (inflammation of the breast). Mastitis is also a significant concern for the US dairy industry because, not only does it represent a significant challenge to animal welfare, but it also decreases milk production and is the most common reason animals are treated with antibiotics. Despite decades of research, mastitis prevention and treatment are poorly understood in both species. One reason for this is that, although mastitis has historically been attributed to the presence of bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, this dogma is now known to be incorrect. Modern advances in the use of DNA sequencing (rather than needing to grow bacteria in culture media) have resulted in a paradigm shift in this regard such that researchers now know that all milk produced by both healthy and mastitic cows and women contains a rich community of microbes. Experts now believe that a dysbiosis in these microbes or a shift in their metabolism causes mammary  inflammation. Consequently, we must now re-examine everything we thought we knew about the etiology and risk factors for this disease. Fundamental to filling this research gap is the rigorous characterization of the  microbiome in milk produced by healthy and mastitic women and cows; and identification of microbial community  “fingerprints” and metabolomic modifiers, thereof, that alter risk of mammary inflammation. In addition,  understanding the similarities and dissimilarities in mammary inflammation between cows and women will help  researchers understand whether the former can be used as a model for the latter (and vice versa). The overall objectives for this project are to 1) compare and contrast the milk microbiome, its functionality, immune  parameters, and inflammatory markers in healthy and mastitic women and cows, and 2) identify milk microbial  profiles and their functionality related to risk for mammary inflammation. Our central hypotheses are that  1) mammary inflammation in both species is associated with shifts in microbes and their function, concentrations of selected markers of immunity and mammary inflammation, and that 2) there exist detectable milk microbiome patterns (or functions) that predispose some women and cows to increased risk of inflammation, and these patterns are related to (and perhaps modified by) environmental and behavioral parameters, some of which are currently considered risk factors for mastitis. To test these hypotheses, we will compare healthy and mastitic cows and women (case-control design) during the first 6 wk postpartum (longitudinal, repeated-measures  design during a high-risk period in both species). Importantly, we will utilize a multi-omics approach and machine learning to understand complex relationships within and between species. The results of this work will lead to better understanding of how the microbiology of the lactating mammary gland is related to mammary  inflammation and will lay the groundwork for future studies to determine how this disease can be prevented and treated. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inflammation of the mammary gland (mastitis) is the leading cause for cessation of breastfeeding, considered the optimal form of nutrition for almost all newborns worldwide, and a major animal welfare and economic  burden for the dairy industry. Mastitis has been attributed to bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, but new evidence demonstrates that all milk (healthy and mastitic) contains a community of microbes. Understanding the bacterial community in milk, and its function, with related host immune response will lead to a reduction in the risk of inflammation in dairy cows and women, support breastfeeding, and promote optimal health in  mothers and infants.",Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis,9572627,R01HD092297,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cattle', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Culture Media', 'DNA sequencing', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Etiology', 'Exclusive Breastfeeding', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Industry', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Lactation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammary gland', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'high risk', 'inflammatory marker', 'inflammatory milieu', 'macromolecule', 'mastitis', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'milk microbiome', 'milk production', 'multiple omics', 'nutrition', 'offspring', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protein metabolite', 'virtual']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,R01,2018,587097,0.01936356466735721
"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9535990,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2018,169112,0.007971774704393956
"Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting Project Summary/Abstract Background and Candidate: Children with orofacial clefting present with increased rate of dental anomalies in shape, size, number, symmetry, abnormal eruption and malposition of teeth both inside and outside the cleft area, leading to dental problems and reduction of quality of life. Although the scientific community has recognized these findings for a long time, the specific etiological factors underlying such anomalies still remain elusive. An important step to understanding etiology is via careful phenotypic approaches that can detect the co-occurrence of such anomalies in discernable patterns that can simplify the identification of risk factors. Dr. Brian Howe is a Clinical Assistant Professor at the College of Dentistry of the University of Iowa. His primary research focus is on the identification and characterization of oral phenotypes in an effort to identify etiological factors underlying the oral phenotypic spectrum of nonsyndromic orofacial clefting. Career Goals: Dr. Howe's short term goals are to deepen is knowledge of complex craniofacial phenotypes and expand his current understanding of craniofacial development. His long term goals are to become a funded independent researcher and a leading clinician and educator in the field of craniofacial phenomics and dentistry as a tenure track faculty at a University of Iowa. His research plan is innovative in that it leverages unique bioinformatics algorithms to identify complex oral phenotypic patterns amenable for studies of risk factors and causality. Environment: The University of Iowa has an established reputation for the successful training of graduate and postdoctoral students in research and clinical areas. It offers learning and development seminars focused on career development and advancement with particular benefits from training opportunities from its Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences (ICTS). Career Development Plan: Dr. Howe is committed to attend courses, tutorials, seminars and relevant conferences as well as meeting regularly with his mentors, collaborators, and advisory committee to fulfill is training aims and gain the knowledge necessary to achieve his future research goals and become an independent clinical researcher. Research Study: This research aims to identify oral phenotypic patterns in orofacial clefting using modern and traditional pattern mining methods in a diverse international population with existing environmental and genetic variables. This knowledge will have key implications in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting as well as driving the implementation of innovative treatment approaches to improve dental outcomes and future preventive strategies. Project Narrative  Individuals with nonsyndromic orofacial clefting present with a wide range of dental anomalies leading to more intricate oral rehabilitation procedures which increases dental morbidity and reduces quality of life in those affected. In the largest international cohort of families with orofacial clefting and controls to date, this project will utilize pattern mining approaches to detect the co-occurrence of particular dental anomalies in discernable patterns that will likely simplify the search for the etiological factors underlying these anomalies. This research will aid in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting by expanding and further defining oral phenotypes which will drive biologically meaningful strategies for the identification of genetic risk factors as well as helping to improve clinical care.",Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting,9582428,K08DE028012,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Enamel', 'Dental crowns', 'Dentistry', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maxilla', 'Mentors', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Odontogenesis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Dentition', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robin bird', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tooth Germ', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vascular blood supply', 'analytical tool', 'calcification', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'college', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial complex', 'craniofacial development', 'design', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'orofacial cleft', 'palatogenesis', 'permanent tooth', 'phenomics', 'professor', 'programs', 'repaired', 'research study', 'risk variant', 'symposium', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'trend']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2018,150636,0.006528508341783537
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9487760,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,1272933,0.0029457438145358865
"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",9505972,R01HL127028,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anthropometry', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular Abnormalities', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dyspnea', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise stress test', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Galectin 3', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Renal function', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Spirometry', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'aged', 'arterial stiffness', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'exercise intolerance', 'fasting glucose', 'fitness', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'longitudinal analysis', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'screening', 'statistics', 'trend']",NHLBI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,1319272,0.026791161407587784
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9526512,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2018,129737,0.02187495354293035
"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis,9505230,K23MH116130,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Israel', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'economic cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal course', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotoxic', 'open source', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'responsible research conduct', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIMH,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2018,191000,0.017955008524235115
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,9666625,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2018,194005,0.02375900468913015
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth.

"Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening PROJECT SUMMARY The guidelines for initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are currently based on two risk factors: attained age and family history of CRC. Using the principles of precision medicine, we will individually tailor CRC screening recommendations based on the enormous knowledge we now have on genetic and non- genetic factors that predict risk for this disease. This strategy will reduce under and over-utilization of CRC screening, because individual risks vary substantially in the population, and over 80% of all CRC cases occur in those without a positive family history. In Aim 1 we will develop predictive models for CRC, based on genetic (~30M common and rare genotyped or imputed genetic variants) and clinico-epidemiologic variables (over 70 harmonized characteristics), derived from over 40,000 colorectal tumor cases and 46,000 controls. We will identify key predictors, and derive efficient personalized risk-prediction models for early detection of more treatable CRCs as well for CRC prevention, through the identification of advanced colorectal adenomas. In Aim 2 we will calibrate and validate these models in two prospective cohorts of >120,000 participants, including 40,000 minority members, diversity representing racially/ethnically and socioeconomically. These two cohorts (Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health and the Women's Health Initiative Minority cohort) contain genome-wide genotype array and comprehensive risk factor data coupled to data on screening and outcome data, allowing us to test the model's ability to predict risk for CRC and advanced colorectal adenoma across a broadly defined community-based population, and to personalize decision on starting age of screening based on individually specific genetic and environmental risk factors. In Aim 3 we will estimate the population benefit of our risk-stratified screening strategy, based on our risk prediction methods, compared with the current screening recommendations. This comparison will employ the well-tested decision model currently used to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force CRC screening guidelines. Accomplishing these three aims, our research has the potential to accelerate the translation of a large amount of genetic and epidemiologic research to patient care by predicting advanced adenoma risk, for cancer prevention, and predicting cancer risk, for early cancer detection. Genetic testing is becoming part of routine care and genetic data will increasingly become part of an individual's medical record. Using genetic and non-genetic risk-factor information in clinical and preventive settings is a critical step towards developing precision medicine. Our models will provide recommendations for individually tailored CRC screening and interventions and, because they are personalized, may also increase adherence, maximize the appropriate use of invasive technologies, and guide important next steps towards public health policy development and clinical translation.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, but current recommendations for initiation of CRC screening do not use important information on individual genetic, lifestyle and environmental risks for this disease. Our research, in large CRC consortia will accelerate the translation of several decades of genetic and epidemiologic research on CRC risks, to allow for personalized screening decisions, based on an individual's specific genetic and environmental risk factor distributions. This work will ensure that the most comprehensive information will inform novel precision medicine strategies for CRC.  ",Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening,9407289,R01CA206279,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'member', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized risk prediction', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'rare variant', 'routine care', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,674450,-0.012228339805312266
"Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism Project Summary/Abstract According to the latest estimates, over 1 in 7 Americans will develop an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) over the course of their lifetime, and alcohol consumption is involved in nearly 4% of deaths worldwide. Thus, AUDs represent a significant public health concern. Currently, the best pharmacotherapies for AUDs require the treatment of 10 patients to observe 1 patient reduce drinking to healthy levels. For this reason, one appealing option is to identify at-risk individuals before they become heavy drinkers; for instance a family history of alcoholism is currently among the best predictors of AUD. Adolescence presents an ideal period to study these factors as it precedes the onset of AUDs but is also a time when there is a rapid increase in consumption. We have recently shown that neuroimaging measures can be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. relapse), suggesting it would also be possible to develop neuroimaging as a predictor of onset of heavy drinking in adolescents. Developing predictive tools to identify adolescents likely to progress to heavy drinking would offer the opportunity for early intervention and could potentially reduce the progression to AUD. Substantial evidence suggests that primary motives for problematic drinking are to enhance positive valence and reduce negative valence emotions. Further, substance use disorders are associated with altered activity in the insula, ventral striatum, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex when processing potential rewards and aversive outcomes. We hypothesize that individuals at risk for AUDs will show heightened response to aversive stimuli in the anterior insula and amygdala and heightened response to rewarding stimuli in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. We further hypothesize that they will exhibit diminished functional connectivity between reward, salience, and executive control networks. To test this, we will recruit 70 adolescents aged 18–20. Half will be have a biological parent with an AUD. The other half will be a control group matched on current drinking levels, age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All participants will undergo a functional MRI scan with a resting state run and a run during a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task that includes the risk of hearing an aversive sound (i.e. a loud scream). All participants will be followed for 6 months after the scan to determine levels of drinking. This study will provide both mechanistic information on risk for AUD as well as a tool to identify adolescents at greatest risk prior to the onset of problem drinking. This information could help provide personalized information about risk that may maximize likelihood of AUD prevention. In addition to the research goals described above, this is a training proposal that is designed to facilitate the transition of the primary investigator, Dr. Joshua Gowin, from mentored post-doctoral research fellow to independent, tenure-track research faculty at an academic institution. The mentored phase of the proposal will use a multifaceted training plan to improve Dr. Gowin’s knowledge base as well as his research and professional skillsets. Specifically, Dr. Gowin will learn new techniques in resting state functional connectivity analysis and in the cognitive neuroscience of emotion regulation. In addition to this scientific training, Dr. Gowin will gain experience management, teaching, and data presentation. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gowin has assembled a team of advisors from the intra- and extramural community with expertise in these areas to guide his training and development. This committee will include Dr. Vijay Ramchandani-NIAAA, Dr. Monique Ernst-NIMH, Dr. Elliot Stein-NIDA, and Dr. Susan Tapert-UCSD (see letters of support). The skills that will be developed during the mentored phase will position Dr. Gowin for success as he applies for an independent position and establishes his own research program. Project Narrative  Alcohol use disorders will affect over one in 10 Americans over the course of their lifetime. The early identification of individuals at greatest risk may provide opportunities to educate or provide services that mitigate individual risk. Therefore, identifying risk factors for alcohol use disorders is an important goal for researchers. One emerging target for research involves using functional MRI to study brain systems that contribute to risk. This project will explore the neural correlates of positive and negative valence emotional processing and how they contribute to risk for the development of alcohol use disorders. Better understanding of these neural processes could inform us about how alcohol use disorders emerge and, importantly, how we might prevent them.",Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism,9752706,R00AA024778,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcoholism', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Extramural Activities', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Review Literature', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Targeted Research', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'aged', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'faculty research', 'financial incentive', 'follow-up', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'negative affect', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'predicting response', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'underage drinking']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2018,249000,-0.05385243712363126
"Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rare monogenic forms of common diseases have provided key fundamental insights about common disease. However, genetic, environmental, and stochastic elements influence risk for disease. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant disorder afflicting 1 in 250 linked to severe increases in LDL cholesterol and premature coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, is an ideal model to characterize modifiers of disease. Despite the presence of a strong genetic driver of hypercholesterolemia from FH mutations, we recently observed that half do not have the expected severe hypercholesterolemia. In this proposal, we outline several methods to discover and dissect the genetic and non-genetic factors influencing CHD risk conferred by FH mutations in humans and determine whether knowledge of these factors can improve risk discrimination among those with FH mutations. Our approach harnesses several multi-dimensional datasets: whole genome sequences, metabolomics, and cross-sectional and longitudinal cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will aggregate and curate 75,000 deep (30X) whole genome sequences and cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will discover genetic and non-genetic modifiers of LDL cholesterol and CHD risk in FH and evaluate their metabolomic consequences. In Aim 3, we will develop a method incorporating genetics and longitudinal non- genetic exposures for CHD risk stratification among ~4,000 with FH mutations in the Million Veteran Program. In addition to the proposed Aims, this five-year proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy for the principal investigator's (PI's) scientific and professional development in academic cardiovascular medicine. The research strategy builds upon the PI's prior research experience and clinical training. In addition to an undergraduate degree in Molecular Biology and master's degree in Biomedical Informatics, he completed post- graduate medical training in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Medicine. He recently developed a new preventive/genetic cardiology clinic focusing on the evaluation and management of those with or a family history of premature CHD, including those with FH, at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills in human genetics and genomics into new domains: integrative genomics, statistical genetics, clinical informatics, and risk modeling. The career development goals will be at achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentorship, collaboration, didactic coursework, conferences, and scientific investigation. This work will take place in a unique training environment comprised of MGH and the Broad Institute. Successful completion of this career development award will result in improved fundamental understanding of the determinants of CHD, result in the PI's transition to an independent physician-scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for R01-level funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cardiovascular disease, largely due to coronary heart disease (CHD), remains the leading cause of death in the United States and now worldwide despite current advances. Familial hypercholesterolemia is a relative common genetic disorder characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia and premature CHD but many carrying these mutations do not develop these consequences. This proposal seeks to define and characterize the factors modifying CHD risk among those with FH mutations; success has the potential to broadly identify new mechanisms of CHD and novel strategies for prevention.",Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model,9431712,K08HL140203,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Algorithms', 'Amish', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Biochemical', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family history of', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Mutation', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'heart disease risk', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'metabolomics', 'next generation', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'trait', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2018,173296,-0.021109734431446096
"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9519828,R01HS025402,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2018,392266,0.008165905688048163
"Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment Diagnosis-based risk adjustment is widely used in the US and abroad for health plan payment, notably for Medicare Parts C and D, for commercial contracting and quality assessment, and in numerous state Medicaid programs. Yet the risk adjustment technology used for payments has not kept up with improved classification systems, larger patient datasets, improved estimation algorithms or recent theoretical and clinical developments. Our work will take advantage of the richer ICD-10-CM classification system, in use since October 2015, with over 5 times as many diagnoses as ICD-9-CM Codes. ICD-10 codes now recognize: left vs. right side for thousands of conditions, distinguish between initial, subsequent and sequela diagnoses, and incorporate hundreds of new clinical, demographic and biometric variables. Based on the ICD-10, more exact models can leverage increased diagnostic coding accuracy to reduce opportunities for gaming or discriminating against patients with conditions who are predicted to be unprofitable. Led by two of the three developers of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS-HCC) existing classification system, our team of physicians, public policy experts, statisticians and economists will comprehensively improve the accuracy of risk adjustment and predictive models using larger sample sizes, clinical judgment and state-of-art economic and statistical modeling. We will also expand the conventional regression methods explored, to include machine learning algorithms, constrained regression, and LASSO estimation. We will calculate a new “appropriateness to include” (ATI) score that captures diagnostic vagueness, discretion and suitability for use in risk adjustment models, and use this score to inform which variables are included in plan payment formulas. Selection incentives remain of concern in public US health plan payments formulas and may be costing Medicare over $5 billion per year (NBER 2017). Prediction and payment models from this project can reduce overpayment and offset plan incentives to skimp on services that attract sick people. To ensure that these models and formulas are useful for enrollees of all ages, they will initially be calibrated and tested on large commercially-insured claims data, covering ages 0 to 64. They will then be validated and refined for Medicare, Medicaid, and state employees using data from All-Payer Claims Data from five states and a second large commercial dataset. We will make development steps, statistical programs, and full details of the classification system and prediction formulas publicly available for comment, refinement, and use by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers. Project Narrative This project will develop new classification systems and new prediction and payment models that take advantage of the fivefold increase in diagnostic codes available with the October 2015 change from ICD- 9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Using data from two national claims datasets and five state all-payer claims datasets that collectively cover over 75 million enrollees, we will identify new, underutilized ICD-10 capabilities, create new clusters of diagnoses useful for prediction, develop new algorithms for using these clusters, and estimate formulas that predict spending, utilization and diverse health care outcomes for all ages. Methods and results will be publicly described and software posted on the web for use in risk adjustment and diverse clinical, financial, policy evaluation, and quality assessment outcomes by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers.",Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment,9644117,R01HS026485,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2018,397399,0.020844329792444948
"Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma SUMMARY: In 2016, nearly 50,000 adults in the US were diagnosed with oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and nearly 10,000 died from the disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as the most common cause of oropharyngeal (OP) SCC in the US. Although concomitant chemo- and radio-therapy is the most common treatment choice in patients with advanced OP-SCC, they have substantial short- and long- term morbidity and result in increased health care costs in patients who are cured of their cancers. These patients live with sometimes disabling morbidity for many years post-treatment. For these reasons, it has been suggested that therapy in lower risk patients might be de-escalated. There is also a higher risk cohort of patients in whom treatment with chemo-radiation may be insufficient, often resulting in distant metastatic failure. As such, these patients may require intensified therapies to improve outcomes. This is an agonizing choice for patients and their doctors, however. While patients do not want to be sickened by morbid treatments, they are obviously concerned about having the best chance at cure. Unfortunately, there currently are no companion diagnostic tools to identify which HPV + OPSCC patients are at (1) low risk of recurrence such that they can be treated safely to high cure rates with de-escalated therapy; (2) higher risk of failure despite aggressive high dose chemoradiation in whom treatment intensification strategies should be studied.  Recently, we developed a quantitative histomorphometric based image risk classifier (QuHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to predict progression in HPV+ OP-SCC patients; the current version of QuHbIC has already been validated in >400 patients and found to be superior to clinical variables in outcome prediction. In this Academic-Industry Partnership we seek to further improve predictive accuracy of QuHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as promising markers of unfavorable prognosis in HPV+ OP-SCC. We also seek to create a pre-commercial QuHbIC companion diagnostic test that is ready for clinical use in risk stratification in p16+ OP-SCC. QuHbIC will be trained on >700 retrospectively identified HPV + OP-SCC whole tissue slide images with associated long term outcome data and then validated on 440 cases from randomized, controlled, multi-institutional RTOG 0129 and 0522 clinical trials.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) computational histomorphometry from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve University, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in HPV+ OPSCC from Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic and, (3) Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company that will bring quality management systems and production software standards to establish QuHbIC as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for oropharyngeal cancers. Project Relevance: In this project we propose to optimize and validate a quantitative histomorphometric-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to better risk stratify survival among p16+ (Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related) OPSCC patients. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be either ""de-escalated”, left as standard, or even potentially escalated, depending on risk status.",Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma,9543057,R01CA220581,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International Union Against Cancer', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stage Grouping', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'common treatment', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'economic need', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'pharynx squamous cell carcinoma', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,671111,-0.022269050783056986
"Rule Based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Early Identification of Patients at Risk of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represent a major global public health problem, with an ICU incidence of 10.4% and an associated mortality rate of 35-45%. Early detection of ARDS is essential for appropriate application of Lung Protective Ventilation, the only therapeutic intervention demonstrated to improve mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with established ARDS. In response to this need, tools that electronically monitor ABG results and interpret radiology reports of CXR findings for evidence of ARDS criteria in mechanically ventilated patients have been developed and deployed in critical care settings. Although these tools have been sufficiently accurate to detect ARDS, they fail to detect early stages of disease progression, prior to full-blown ARDS development, in at risk patients. Recent initiatives are focused on tools to identify patients in very early stages of ARDS before wide-spread alveolar damage has occurred, enabling strategies focused on prevention of ARDS development. Among efforts to use EMR data to reliably identify patients at high risk of developing ARDS, the most notable are the Lung Injury Prediction Score (LIPS) and the “early acute lung injury” score (EALI). Validation studies show these promising tools have discriminating performance with an area under ROC curve (AUC) in the .7-.8 range, and demonstrate risk detection early in the course of illness, well in advance of frank respiratory failure. Our vision is to build on these efforts, and derive a highly automated early identification algorithm based on routinely captured medical record data that reliably and accurately identifies trajectories associated with post-exposure to specific classes of risk factors that predicts patients at risk for development of ARDS with an AUC discrimination in excess of .95. We believe the predictive performance of existing ARDS screening tools can be significantly improved by: 1) combined use of highly specific/sensitive cognitive/explanatory models to help guide machine learning by reducing “label noise” and identifying specific risk-induced trajectories associated with progression to ARDS; 2) exploring a full constellation of predictive risk factors not yet addressed by earlier efforts; 3) use of advanced natural language processing technology to extract ARDS risk information from free text clinical reports, and 4) use of enhanced machine learning algorithms that are label noise tolerant and combine the predictive power of nonparametric algorithms with the feature interpretability associated with parametric techniques. Despite advances in critical care medicine, mortality among patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) remains high, up to 45% for severe cases. There is no proven pharmacological treatment for ARDS; current treatment approaches focus on providing supportive care. Consequently, there is great community interest in targeted prevention of ARDS. The goal of this research is to develop and validate a highly predictive real-time ARDS surveillance software system that can be routinely used in hospitals to detect early stages of this syndrome, enabling interventions that can reduce the progression to full-blown disease. Our approach uses modern artificial intelligence techniques including cognitive reasoning, machine learning and natural language processing to dramatically reduce preventable ARDS mortality in hospitalized patients.",Rule Based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Early Identification of Patients at Risk of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),9345675,R43HL135909,"['Acute Lung Injury', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Algorithms', 'Alveolar', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Berlin', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'ICD-9', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Onset of illness', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiological', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary to', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'base', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'lung injury', 'mortality', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'software systems', 'syndromic surveillance', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,"COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2017,149470,0.022576044791675052
"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9335456,K01MH106710,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Surveys', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric epidemiology', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reading', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rosa', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Self-Administered', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stressful Event', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'salivary assay', 'secondary analysis', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),K01,2017,166910,0.028468679686890954
"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9310380,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'routine imaging', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,653101,0.003559323604846412
"Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) includes serious threats to maternal health and survival that occur at delivery or postpartum. SMM, which includes postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, sepsis, and other serious conditions, can be life-threatening and have long-term effects on a woman’s health as well as adversely impact her infant’s health and well-being. Over the past 15 years, the prevalence of SMM has doubled in the U.S., currently affecting more than 65,000 women each year. Additionally, the prevalence of SMM is highest in women of minority races and ethnicities, particularly women who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. However, the most important risk factors for SMM are not established and it is unknown what is contributing to racial/ethnic disparities and increasing trends in SMM. Our goal is to improve the understanding of SMM and its risk factors to provide evidence that supports efforts to reduce the prevalence of SMM and racial/ethnic disparities in SMM. The proposed project will use linked vital statistics, patient discharge, and U.S. Census data for over 4 million births in California from 2007 to 2014. We will test trends in SMM prevalence and calculate the population attributable risks for three key potential risk factors—advanced maternal age, prepregnancy obesity, and cesarean delivery—and their combination across the years of study (Aim 1). Additionally, we will examine a wide range of potential risk factors to identify those that are most important using a machine-learning/data-adaptive approach (Aim 2). Both study aims will be done in the overall sample and separately in racial/ethnic groups. Understanding SMM trends and determining the strongest predictors of SMM are critical steps to launch forward research of this pressing and understudied public health problem. Many factors may present crucial opportunities to prevent the development severe maternal morbidity—saving the lives of mothers and helping ensure a healthy future for their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year, more and more new mothers are diagnosed with serious pregnancy-related medical conditions, particularly mothers who identify as racial/ethnic minorities. Research is urgently needed to understand what is driving this alarming problem and what puts women most at risk so future research can be conducted to guide interventions and clinical care for childbearing women.","Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities",9327774,F32HD091945,"['Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Age', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patient Discharge', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Population Study', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Vital Statistics', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'advanced maternal age', 'base', 'child bearing', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic minority population', 'improved', 'indexing', 'maternal morbidity', 'outcome prediction', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'social', 'trend']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2017,56334,0.03053877721296504
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9363302,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional', 'vascular sonography']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,518262,0.03331554683564096
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,9198041,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency research', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2017,163944,0.04717841291768421
"A Novel Probabilistic Methodology for Prediction of Emerging Diseases in Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment for people living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) currently accounts for an estimated 66 percent of the Nation's health care costs and will continue to grow. This mounting challenge has become a major public health issue since MCC is linked to suboptimal health outcomes and rising health care costs. However, it now known how MCC emerge among individuals or in the general population. Traditional epidemiological approaches have led to important findings of disease links and comorbidity associations. However, they are limited in their ability to characterize how patients acquire new chronic conditions and predict/personalize the emergence of MCC for individual patients. Objectives: This study will develop approaches that can be used to identify the most likely combinations of comorbidity within a population. These approaches can be tailored to examine MCC patterns in specific sub- populations or at the level of the individual patient. We will also study the effect of a large set of risk factors on MCC combinations emergence. Furthermore, we will use data mining approaches to predict and monitor the development of MCC combinations in at the population and individual levels. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that the emergence and progression of comorbidities in MCC patients form patterns that can be predicted and which are associated with prior medical conditions, demographic, and socio-economic characteristics. We further hypothesize that these methods can predict the timing and emergence of new chronic diseases more accurately by personalizing the records for individual patients. Aims and methodology: in Aim1, we will characterize how MCC emerge and progress in distinct patterns and how these patterns transition between different combinations of diseases over time. We will then identify and group major MCC transitions using the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm, which is a novel, efficient graphical approach to handle big data. In Aim 2, we will identify which risk factors are associated with MCC emergence using a machine learning approach that can handle the complex heterogeneity of comorbidity patterns. Risk factors include age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, economic status, marital status, and prior medical conditions. In Aim 3, we will use a similarity learning approach to develop models that can predict if MCC will emerge in individual patients or among populations and we will be able to use these models to monitor MCC emergence over time. Conclusion: Our findings will provide a foundation for future research that will evaluate specific treatment patterns associated with progression in MCC patterns and ultimately identify optimal time points of intervention for those with, or at risk for multiple chronic conditions. These findings will also provide information that can be used at the community level to manage healthcare resources to improve continuity and accessibility of care.

"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,9324206,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Preventive measure', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K25,2017,156686,0.007436774662520224
"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.","Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies",9275293,R01AA024391,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dependence', 'Distal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heart Rate', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol involvement', 'alcohol services', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'coping', 'cost', 'craving', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'model development', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'real time model', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'relative cost', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'stressor']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,381816,-0.025486330897025972
"Enabling value-based healthcare through automating risk assessment for episode-based care Project Summary Value-based healthcare implementation relies on understanding risk. 1 Early models, such as Medicare Advantage, use annual measures of risk under a risk adjustment factor (RAF) to offer financial incentive to payers and hospitals to work together. 2 More advanced models, such as bundled payments, target the periods of greatest quality variability, specifically episodes of care such as joint replacement, oncology diagnosis, and cardiac procedures. In these episodes, many types of providers, from hospitals to outpatient physical therapists, need to work together to reduce rates of complication and readmission. Risk levels are used to adjust payment for payer and providers and to determine which patients require additional resources in the hospital, clinic, or home. Unfortunately, existing risk models lack key features needed for episode-based care, which requires both financial alignment and accurate and immediate information to adjust clinical resources for a given case. 3 4 A better model would include all conditions relevant to an episode rather than just chronic conditions, addition of social determinants, and an automated approach to retrieve the information in hours rather than months. Thus, this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I program includes the following Specific Aims: 1. Create the phenotyping components required to define an accurate and comprehensive model  of episode-based risk, including: (i) extract clinical and social features from clinical data using  natural language processing (NLP), (ii) map concepts including social features to an ontology  that will support normalized data use, (iii) build a feature vector for each record that can be  used to feed a risk model that accounts for relevant clinical and social risk 2. Validate the phenotyping components using de-identified longitudinal clinical data for 10,000 patients In this research program, Phase I will tackle the most difficult challenges, including leveraging narrative text to recognize time-labeled social and clinical features influencing an episode of care. Success criteria will be accurate recognition of key underlying features that have not been available in risk models to date. Phase II will build upon the validated technology to create an episode-based risk model run on narrative and discrete clinical data and tested against actual patient outcomes. Success criteria will be a validated episode-based risk model to support value-based contracting and value-based clinical care. Project Narrative Advanced payment models in United States healthcare rely on accurate assessment of risk and quality. While quality has gained broad attention, risk models remain outdated and poorly suited to advanced payment models. CapsicoHealth proposes an effort to redefine risk models used for episode-based payments, using data sets across the continuum of care and clinical and social determinants of care that have previously been unavailable in computable form. If successful, this effort will impact financial and clinical approaches to value-based healthcare and significantly increase the chance that national efforts to improve cost and quality will be effective.",Enabling value-based healthcare through automating risk assessment for episode-based care,9464424,R43LM012798,"['Attention', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complication', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Contracts', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Reform', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Insurance', 'Label', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'care episode', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'concept mapping', 'cost', 'feeding', 'financial incentive', 'improved', 'interest', 'oncology', 'payment', 'physical therapist', 'programs', 'social', 'success', 'vector']",NLM,"CAPSICOHEALTH, INC.",R43,2017,222588,0.027162834662478676
"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization. Given the rapidly rising numbers of patients with dementia, reducing potentially preventable hospitalization could have an enormous impact on public health.",Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms,9291398,K08AG048321,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Assessment tool', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Bioinformatics', 'Capsicum', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Community Psychiatry', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'International', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kale - dietary', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Rural', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleeplessness', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'behavior change', 'career', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'geriatric mental health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'medication compliance', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2017,175103,0.01968435798819263
"Measuring Inequality in Early Mortality Across All Births in the Developing World Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Antonio Pedro Ramos graduated with a PhD in Political Science in 2015 and an MS in Statistics in 2014, both from UCLA. His dissertation investigated the effects of recent democratization waves on infant and child mortality among the poor in developing countries. In his graduate work, health indicators were used as a tool to test political economy theories, and thus were not the main focus of his analysis. This fellowship will allow Dr. Ramos to obtain the demographic, statistical and health policy expertise to transit from being a political scientist to become a health scholar working with health inequality.  One fundamental dimension of social inequality is inequality in early-life survival. To date, most studies on early-life mortality analyze between-group comparisons, such as income groups within the same country, and they have documented large disparities. While between-group differences are informative they mask important disparities in the mortality risk within groups. Dr Ramos' proposed project is to develop methodologies that (1) can measure inequality in early-life mortality among all births and (2) improve policy targeting by identifying small cells of high risk births that are nested within and across large groups of births.  During the K99 phase, with supervision from his mentors, Dr. Ramos will develop the methodologies that can be used to characterize and explain inequality in early-life mortality across all births and identify high risk births. His methods will be tested on a data set he already acquired that includes records on 5.5 million births from 50 developing countries. In his R00 phase, he will implement large-scale analysis by combining data from multiple sources to produce globals maps of health inequality and high risk births, as well as examine the impact of health policies on reducing child mortality.  UCLA is the ideal place for Dr. Ramos' training and research in public health and applied statistics because of its unique combination of expertise. This includes Dr. Ramos' mentoring team, several other scholars that work on similar topics in various academic centers, classes, seminars, and computational and technical resources that are available at UCLA.  Dr. Ramos is contributing to research and policy practice by developing a methodology that will allow re- searchers and policymakers to measure inequality in early mortality across births and to identify high risk births regardless of their large group membership. By doing so, this project will be the ﬁrst to: 1) draw a time-varying map of total inequality in early mortality across the developing world; 2) identify major correlates of these dispar- ities; and 3) develop more cost effective public health policies. Project Narrative Most studies on early-life mortality compare large groups of births, such as poor and non-poor within countries, and design health interventions to reduce disparities between these groups. These comparisons mask large disparities in mortality risk within births from the same group. The goal of this project is to develop a methodology to measure inequality across births and to better target public health interventions.",Measuring Inequality in Early Mortality Across All Births in the Developing World,9325555,K99HD088727,"['Address', 'Birth', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child Mortality', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Survey', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fellowship', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infant Mortality', 'International Agencies', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Politics', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survey Methodology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparison group', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'mortality', 'mortality disparity', 'policy implication', 'public health intervention', 'semiparametric', 'social inequality', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2017,123390,0.033924793544933454
"An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed to financially penalize hospitals that have 30-day readmission rates above the national mean. As a result hospitals caring for disadvantaged populations with more needs might be penalized by current 30-day readmission models that do not include measures of social risk and functional status of the patients served. These are two important variable domains that directly impact a patient's ability to manage their disease. Social risk factors (e.g. living alone, social support, marginal housing, and alcohol abuse) and functional status (e.g. mobility, fall risk) are rarely present in administrative data, which is why so few readmission models include this data. Yet many of these variables are available in electronic health records (EHR) and the advancement of the field of informatics has made the extraction of these data feasible. These variables may improve the discriminative ability of 30-day readmission models which currently explain little of the variation in readmission rates among patients.  We propose to improve 30-day readmission models by extracting measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR using the novel method of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will combine administrative data (VA and Medicare) and data extracted from the national EHR in the VA for 6000 patients 65 and older in 2011 to improve upon currently available 30-day hospital readmission risk prediction models for congestive heart failure (CHF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia and stroke. We have chosen these conditions because hospital-level 30-day readmission rates for these conditions (CHF, AMI and pneumonia) are currently or will soon be (stroke) publicly reported. Our proposal has two goals: 1) to develop, test and evaluate automated NLP algorithms designed to extract measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR and 2) to understand the impact of these two novel domains on 30-day readmission across four conditions with fundamentally different post-discharge hospital course and disease trajectories.  We propose a paradigm shift in the understanding and obtainment of factors predictive of 30-day readmission. Our overarching hypothesis is that social risk factors and functional status which directly influence a patient's self-management ability are critical factors predictive of 30-day readmission, can be extracted from the EHR, and should be included in risk prediction models. The development of better risk prediction models will allow the identification of patients at highest risk of readmission and facilitate post-discharge interventions in their care. In addition, if social risk factors and functional status are criticalin explaining variation in 30-day readmission rates, then hospitals that care for patients with a higher burden of social risk and functional needs may be inappropriately penalized by current risk predictions models that lack these measures. Also, as more hospitals adopt EHRs, we need to study more advanced technologies such as automated NLP as tools to efficiently extract information and to inform health systems about the characteristics of the patients they serve. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About a fifth of all Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge, potentially exposing the patients and their families to distress and unnecessary costs. An improved understanding of who is at highest risk of readmission will allow hospitals to efficiently intervene in the care of patients who may benefit the most from post-discharge interventions.",An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission,9288224,R01HL116522,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Management', 'Severity of illness', 'Social support', 'Stroke', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'disadvantaged population', 'fall risk', 'functional status', 'health administration', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'hospital patient care', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'marginally housed', 'mortality', 'novel', 'payment', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2017,585633,0.03430047905610565
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry. This research is expected to impact the clinical management of AAA disease, as well as the pre-surgical planning capabilities of vascular and endovascular aneurysm repair.",Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,9250195,R01HL121293,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Aneurysm', 'Award', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pressure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'repaired', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2017,398926,0.03513185418698715
"Infection Control Implications of Heterogeneous Resistance Mechanisms in Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) PROJECT SUMMARY In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assigned its highest antibiotic resistance threat level to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). CRE are resistant to nearly all routinely used antibiotics with gram-negative coverage and have been implicated in several high-profile nosocomial outbreaks in United States (U.S.) facilities. Although in past outbreaks institutions have deployed aggressive and highly bundled responses, this “kitchen sink” approach is unlikely to be resource- or cost-effective as CRE become endemic in the U.S. Evidence-based CRE policies are necessary, but fundamental gaps in knowledge remain. In particular, heterogeneous mechanisms encode carbapenem resistance in CRE, which are broadly classifiable by whether carbapenem resistance does (“CP-CRE”) or does not (“non-CP-CRE”) arise from carbapenemase production. Until recently resistance testing was limited in clinical settings, but this landscape is changing with the rollout of commercially available assays for identifying carbapenemase production. However, data on the prevalence of CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE in U.S. patients, especially among high-risk hospitalized populations, are limited. Moreover, some evidence suggests that propensity for intra-facility spread differs between CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE, but rigorous data are lacking. Evaluating epidemiological differences in CRE resistance types is essential to establishing public health priorities for CRE prevention in U.S. healthcare facilities. Aim 1 will evaluate the prevalence of and pre-admission risk factors for rectal colonization with CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE in a cohort of approximately 1900 patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and comprehensive transplant unit (CTU) at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Risk factors will be analyzed with machine learning methodologies in order to develop a user-friendly decision tree to identify patients at high-risk of CP-CRE and/or non-CP-CRE carriage for future targeted surveillance screening. Aim 2 will utilize serially collected rectal swabs, in conjunction with clinical and environmental data, to estimate the incidence of nosocomial CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE colonization and to evaluate the contribution of asymptomatic CRE carriers and individual-level risk factors on a patient's risk of CRE acquisition during unit hospitalization. Strain-typing and other analyses as needed (e.g., whole genome sequencing) will be available to ascertain transmission events. This will be the first study in a U.S. hospital to investigate CRE spread associated exclusively with asymptomatic carriers and stratified by resistance type in a non-outbreak setting. The broad, long-term goals of this proposal are to advance our understanding of the epidemiology of CRE colonization and the implications of CRE resistance mechanisms to routes of nosocomial acquisition in order to guide CRE control policies and resource prioritization in U.S. healthcare facilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heterogeneous mechanisms encode carbapenem resistance in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Understanding the infection control implications of this heterogeneity has assumed newfound relevance with the rollout of resistance mechanism assays to identify carbapenemase production. The proposed research seeks to examine whether risk factors for CRE colonization and propensity for organism spread in the hospital environment differ by CRE resistance type, in order to promote evidence-based strategies for CRE control in U.S. hospitals.",Infection Control Implications of Heterogeneous Resistance Mechanisms in Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE),9267654,R36HS025089,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R36,2017,41785,0.026482407964090654
"Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT The purpose of this K07 proposal is to provide Jeffrey Lee, MD, MAS with the protected time and resources to pursue the additional training needed to reach his long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator, focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality for CRC. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps (adenomas) and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. With limited data available in the literature to determine the appropriate timing and frequency of follow-up colonoscopy for patients after adenoma removal, recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance from our national guidelines have been imprecise at best. For example, the currently recommended range of 5-10 years for a surveillance colonoscopy for patients with a single adenoma covers a two-fold difference in exam frequency, with resultant two-fold impact on patient risk, cost, and colonoscopy capacity. To help optimize the timing of colonoscopic surveillance and guide appropriate utilization of this invasive and costly resource, stratification of CRC risk after colonoscopic polypectomy from a large community-based cohort with long-term follow-up is needed. Building on his prior work in CRC screening, Dr. Lee seeks to fill this knowledge gap by optimizing surveillance practices in post-polypectomy patients according to patient-, polyp-, and colonoscopy exam-related factors. Specifically, he will determine the long- term CRC risk in patients after colonoscopic polypectomy in a very large “real world” community-based population (Aim 1). He will also identify patient-, polyp-, and exam-related risk factors associated with incident CRC in these patients (Aim 2). Finally, he will develop a CRC risk prediction model that will identify post- polypectomy patients at high and low risk for developing subsequent CRC (Aim 3). To achieve these goals, Dr. Lee and his mentors have designed a career development plan for research and educational training to obtain: 1) knowledge and expertise in advanced epidemiologic methods for design and analysis of cohort studies; 2) knowledge in medical informatics methods; and 3) predictive modeling skills. To achieve the proposed research aims, Dr. Lee will leverage the rich electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large community-based healthcare system, in which data on patient, physician, colonoscopy, pathology, and CRC status have been collected since 1994. In addition, Dr. Lee will use an established natural language processing tool to efficiently collect data and evaluate potential confounding variables from more than 600,000 colonoscopy reports in order to address one of the main practical challenges that have limited the feasibility of large-scale population-based studies. Thus, completion of these aims has the potential to improve prevention and early detection of CRC, impact current surveillance guidelines for post-polypectomy patients, and reduce overuse and underuse of surveillance colonoscopy. Importantly, this proposal is realistic and feasible within the award period and will allow Dr. Lee to continue to build research skills, generate preliminary data, create additional collaborative relationships, and compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K07 award will support and accelerate the career development activities of Dr. Lee and allow him to successfully launch into the next phase of his career as an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized controlled trials have shown that screening reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. Thus in this proposal, we will determine the long-term risk and risk factors of CRC after colonoscopic polypectomy, and develop a CRC risk prediction model to tailor surveillancein post- polypectomy patients using a large, community-based cohort.","Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort",9352810,K07CA212057,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Polypectomy', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Premalignant', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scheme', 'Stratification', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Surveillance Program', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'skills', 'surveillance strategy', 'tool']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K07,2017,67563,0.04166201725213926
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9396635,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2017,56334,0.018219141229783027
"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9369218,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2017,170466,0.007971774704393956
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9329487,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,1254231,0.0029457438145358865
"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",9313715,R01HL127028,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anthropometry', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular Abnormalities', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dyspnea', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise stress test', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Galectin 3', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Spirometry', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'aged', 'arterial stiffness', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'exercise intolerance', 'fasting glucose', 'fitness', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'longitudinal analysis', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'statistics', 'trend']",NHLBI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,1338683,0.026791161407587784
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9312144,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2017,130380,0.02187495354293035
"Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening PROJECT SUMMARY The guidelines for initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are currently based on two risk factors: attained age and family history of CRC. Using the principles of precision medicine, we will individually tailor CRC screening recommendations based on the enormous knowledge we now have on genetic and non- genetic factors that predict risk for this disease. This strategy will reduce under and over-utilization of CRC screening, because individual risks vary substantially in the population, and over 80% of all CRC cases occur in those without a positive family history. In Aim 1 we will develop predictive models for CRC, based on genetic (~30M common and rare genotyped or imputed genetic variants) and clinico-epidemiologic variables (over 70 harmonized characteristics), derived from over 40,000 colorectal tumor cases and 46,000 controls. We will identify key predictors, and derive efficient personalized risk-prediction models for early detection of more treatable CRCs as well for CRC prevention, through the identification of advanced colorectal adenomas. In Aim 2 we will calibrate and validate these models in two prospective cohorts of >120,000 participants, including 40,000 minority members, diversity representing racially/ethnically and socioeconomically. These two cohorts (Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health and the Women's Health Initiative Minority cohort) contain genome-wide genotype array and comprehensive risk factor data coupled to data on screening and outcome data, allowing us to test the model's ability to predict risk for CRC and advanced colorectal adenoma across a broadly defined community-based population, and to personalize decision on starting age of screening based on individually specific genetic and environmental risk factors. In Aim 3 we will estimate the population benefit of our risk-stratified screening strategy, based on our risk prediction methods, compared with the current screening recommendations. This comparison will employ the well-tested decision model currently used to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force CRC screening guidelines. Accomplishing these three aims, our research has the potential to accelerate the translation of a large amount of genetic and epidemiologic research to patient care by predicting advanced adenoma risk, for cancer prevention, and predicting cancer risk, for early cancer detection. Genetic testing is becoming part of routine care and genetic data will increasingly become part of an individual's medical record. Using genetic and non-genetic risk-factor information in clinical and preventive settings is a critical step towards developing precision medicine. Our models will provide recommendations for individually tailored CRC screening and interventions and, because they are personalized, may also increase adherence, maximize the appropriate use of invasive technologies, and guide important next steps towards public health policy development and clinical translation.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, but current recommendations for initiation of CRC screening do not use important information on individual genetic, lifestyle and environmental risks for this disease. Our research, in large CRC consortia will accelerate the translation of several decades of genetic and epidemiologic research on CRC risks, to allow for personalized screening decisions, based on an individual's specific genetic and environmental risk factor distributions. This work will ensure that the most comprehensive information will inform novel precision medicine strategies for CRC.  ",Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening,9237818,R01CA206279,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'member', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'rare variant', 'routine care', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2017,738377,-0.012228339805312266
"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9365658,R01HS025402,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2017,400000,0.008165905688048163
"Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone mass and structural deterioration leading to increased risk of fracture. Currently, osteoporosis is diagnosed by measurement of areal bone mineral density by dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the majority of fractures occur in both women and men who are not classified as osteoporotic by current DXA criteria (T-score = -2.5). As a 2-dimensional (2D) technology, DXA does not provide information about 3-dimensional (3D) bone structure, shape and geometry, which substantially contribute to bone strength and resistance to fracture. Finite element (FE) analysis of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images can provide 3D structure and strength measurements but QCT is impractical for widespread clinical use because of high radiation exposure and expense. In contrast, DXA is widely available, inexpensive and has low radiation exposure. What is needed is a method by which DXA images can be used to generate 3D shape models that incorporate bone structure and geometry. However, fractures are complex events influenced by other factors including age, race, body mass index, risk of falls, and prior medical and fracture history. Even sophisticated measurements of bone density, structure, and strength may not be able to predict fractures accurately. Machine learning is an emerging field in which models are created by ""learning"" from previous data. These models can incorporate various factors and be used to classify or predict outcomes for new data. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced analyses of widely available DXA images that incorporate structural and strength information and statistical modeling using machine learning to incorporate additional risk factors will better identify patient at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. This hypothesis will be tested using QCT and DXA data from previous studies to generate 3D statistical shape models that describe variability in proximal femur morphology. By aligning 2D DXA images to the models, patient-specific 3D models will be reconstructed for quantitative analyses and combined with FE analysis to estimate bone strength. Machine learning models will be used to incorporate these novel measurements, demographics, and various risk factors for fracture to predict incident fractures in two very large, prospective studies. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to increase the diagnostic utility of DXA, a safe, non-invasive, and widely available technology, by applying novel image processing and statistical techniques to predict fractures more accurately. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 are destined to suffer an osteoporotic fracture during their remaining lifetime. Unfortunately, the current standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, DXA, does not predict most fractures. This research will develop advanced analyses of DXA images and use machine learning to improve individualized fracture risk assessment.",Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA,9068774,K99AR067883,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'American', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Cadaver', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hip Fractures', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Osteopenia', 'Osteoporosis', 'Osteoporotic', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Postmenopause', 'Prospective Studies', 'Race', 'Radiation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'bone geometry', 'bone mass', 'bone strength', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnosis standard', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prospective', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2016,91800,0.019689737232720935
"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9159185,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,671851,0.003559323604846412
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,9119862,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Huntington Disease', 'Huntington gene', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2016,356244,0.007091628916806313
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8984911,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2016,163944,0.04717841291768421
"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.","Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies",9121449,R01AA024391,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dependence', 'Distal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Heart Rate', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'coping', 'cost', 'craving', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'model development', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'real time model', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'stressor']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,381816,-0.025486330897025972
"Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia Project Summary ""Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention in Schizophrenia”  Schizophrenia is one of the most debilitating disorders in the world today. It affects over 2.4 million adult Americans each year. NIMH director Dr. Thomas Insel has declared “The best chance for preventing serious functional disability among people with schizophrenia may be to intervene at the earliest stages of the disorder, at the first episode of psychosis or even before symptoms appear. However, to act before symptoms appear requires improved predictive capacity” (NIMH 2011 Budget). Creating tools to identify high-risk, `prodromal' individuals may be the single most important step towards developing effective interventions to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), and thereby also reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with schizophrenia. Recent studies have shown that over 54% of individuals with schizophrenia are re-hospitalized within the first 12 months following their initial hospitalization. Even after the first hospitalization, preventing relapse and re-hospitalization may lessen the long-term severity of the illness. In this SBIR Phase I study, we propose to determine the feasibility of screening for prodromal individuals and individuals at high risk of relapse by applying interpretive algorithms to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD). We hypothesize that PGMSD can effectively assist in screening for prodromal individuals who are progressing toward psychosis as well as for remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP).  In Phase I, we plan to recruit 70 individuals who have been or are being evaluated at the Prodromal clinics at Columbia, UCSD, and UCLA, where an estimated 70 to 90% of clients already own Smartphones. Data gathered may include: the frequency of telephone calls, emails, and texts, to assess within person changes in social connectedness; GPS, accelerometer data, to assess physical activity, isolation, and sleep patterns. In the past, several IRB-approved studies have used smartphones for gathering similar data from patients. Algorithms will be developed using several techniques including machine learning to convert the meta-level data into measures of social functioning, physical isolation, physical activity, and sleep/wake reversals. In addition to achieving technological success, our goal in Phase I is to provide evidence of our ability to use PGMSD algorithms to differentiating group means of participants who are controls, prodromal, or experiencing their FEP (SIPS 1 or 2; 3, 4, or 5; or 6).  In Phase II, we will further develop and validate these algorithms. If successful, the Phase II project will have a large and sustained impact as our algorithms will help (1) identify at-risk individuals who `are' or `are not' progressing toward conversion, (2) serve as an objective measure of treatment effectiveness; (3) give rise to clinical reports delivered to EHR systems that hold promise for preventing relapse during the critical 12 months after initial diagnosis, potentially reducing hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. Project Narrative The proposed research protocol seeks to determine the feasibility of identifying individuals progressing toward a first psychotic episode or re-hospitalization by applying interpretive algorithms developed in part using machine learning to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD) collected from the smartphones of 70 participants ages 18-30. If successful, the PGMSD-derived algorithms will assist in screening for prodromal individuals progressing toward psychosis as well as with remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP), potentially decrease hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. This passive data gathering approach will augment existing active data collection approaches, aid clinicians in focusing on interpreting rather than gathering data from their clients, and could modify clinical paradigms by shifting treatment from individuals suffering from Schizophrenia to individuals who are at risk of developing psychosis with the goal of achieving `secondary' and eventually `primary' prevention.",Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia,9201713,R43MH107097,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Incipient Schizophrenia', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupational', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Poverty', 'Primary Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Universities', 'Work', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'information gathering', 'insight', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prevent', 'programs', 'real world application', 'relapse risk', 'screening', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,"TELESAGE, INC.",R43,2016,366201,0.0146878192826166
"A Novel Probabilistic Methodology for Prediction of Emerging Diseases in Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment for people living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) currently accounts for an estimated 66 percent of the Nation's health care costs and will continue to grow. This mounting challenge has become a major public health issue since MCC is linked to suboptimal health outcomes and rising health care costs. However, it now known how MCC emerge among individuals or in the general population. Traditional epidemiological approaches have led to important findings of disease links and comorbidity associations. However, they are limited in their ability to characterize how patients acquire new chronic conditions and predict/personalize the emergence of MCC for individual patients. Objectives: This study will develop approaches that can be used to identify the most likely combinations of comorbidity within a population. These approaches can be tailored to examine MCC patterns in specific sub- populations or at the level of the individual patient. We will also study the effect of a large set of risk factors on MCC combinations emergence. Furthermore, we will use data mining approaches to predict and monitor the development of MCC combinations in at the population and individual levels. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that the emergence and progression of comorbidities in MCC patients form patterns that can be predicted and which are associated with prior medical conditions, demographic, and socio-economic characteristics. We further hypothesize that these methods can predict the timing and emergence of new chronic diseases more accurately by personalizing the records for individual patients. Aims and methodology: in Aim1, we will characterize how MCC emerge and progress in distinct patterns and how these patterns transition between different combinations of diseases over time. We will then identify and group major MCC transitions using the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm, which is a novel, efficient graphical approach to handle big data. In Aim 2, we will identify which risk factors are associated with MCC emergence using a machine learning approach that can handle the complex heterogeneity of comorbidity patterns. Risk factors include age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, economic status, marital status, and prior medical conditions. In Aim 3, we will use a similarity learning approach to develop models that can predict if MCC will emerge in individual patients or among populations and we will be able to use these models to monitor MCC emergence over time. Conclusion: Our findings will provide a foundation for future research that will evaluate specific treatment patterns associated with progression in MCC patterns and ultimately identify optimal time points of intervention for those with, or at risk for multiple chronic conditions. These findings will also provide information that can be used at the community level to manage healthcare resources to improve continuity and accessibility of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative This research proposal aims to better understand the emergence of multiple chronic conditions by identifying and predicting emerging diseases in young adults and discovering the patient characteristics associated with comorbidity emergence and progression.            ",A Novel Probabilistic Methodology for Prediction of Emerging Diseases in Patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions,9074366,SC2GM118266,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'data mining', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'multitask', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'young adult']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC2,2016,147000,0.012029005227167974
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,9133363,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Preventive measure', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K25,2016,157765,0.007436774662520224
"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization.

"Measuring Inequality in Early Mortality Across All Births in the Developing World Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Antonio Pedro Ramos graduated with a PhD in Political Science in 2015 and an MS in Statistics in 2014, both from UCLA. His dissertation investigated the effects of recent democratization waves on infant and child mortality among the poor in developing countries. In his graduate work, health indicators were used as a tool to test political economy theories, and thus were not the main focus of his analysis. This fellowship will allow Dr. Ramos to obtain the demographic, statistical and health policy expertise to transit from being a political scientist to become a health scholar working with health inequality.  One fundamental dimension of social inequality is inequality in early-life survival. To date, most studies on early-life mortality analyze between-group comparisons, such as income groups within the same country, and they have documented large disparities. While between-group differences are informative they mask important disparities in the mortality risk within groups. Dr Ramos' proposed project is to develop methodologies that (1) can measure inequality in early-life mortality among all births and (2) improve policy targeting by identifying small cells of high risk births that are nested within and across large groups of births.  During the K99 phase, with supervision from his mentors, Dr. Ramos will develop the methodologies that can be used to characterize and explain inequality in early-life mortality across all births and identify high risk births. His methods will be tested on a data set he already acquired that includes records on 5.5 million births from 50 developing countries. In his R00 phase, he will implement large-scale analysis by combining data from multiple sources to produce globals maps of health inequality and high risk births, as well as examine the impact of health policies on reducing child mortality.  UCLA is the ideal place for Dr. Ramos' training and research in public health and applied statistics because of its unique combination of expertise. This includes Dr. Ramos' mentoring team, several other scholars that work on similar topics in various academic centers, classes, seminars, and computational and technical resources that are available at UCLA.  Dr. Ramos is contributing to research and policy practice by developing a methodology that will allow re- searchers and policymakers to measure inequality in early mortality across births and to identify high risk births regardless of their large group membership. By doing so, this project will be the ﬁrst to: 1) draw a time-varying map of total inequality in early mortality across the developing world; 2) identify major correlates of these dispar- ities; and 3) develop more cost effective public health policies. Project Narrative Most studies on early-life mortality compare large groups of births, such as poor and non-poor within countries, and design health interventions to reduce disparities between these groups. These comparisons mask large disparities in mortality risk within births from the same group. The goal of this project is to develop a methodology to measure inequality across births and to better target public health interventions.",Measuring Inequality in Early Mortality Across All Births in the Developing World,9165149,K99HD088727,"['Address', 'Birth', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child Mortality', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Survey', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fellowship', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infant Mortality', 'International Agencies', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Policy Research', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survey Methodology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'comparison group', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'global health', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'mortality disparity', 'policy implication', 'public health intervention', 'research study', 'social inequality', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2016,123390,0.033924793544933454
"An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed to financially penalize hospitals that have 30-day readmission rates above the national mean. As a result hospitals caring for disadvantaged populations with more needs might be penalized by current 30-day readmission models that do not include measures of social risk and functional status of the patients served. These are two important variable domains that directly impact a patient's ability to manage their disease. Social risk factors (e.g. living alone, social support, marginal housing, and alcohol abuse) and functional status (e.g. mobility, fall risk) are rarely present in administrative data, which is why so few readmission models include this data. Yet many of these variables are available in electronic health records (EHR) and the advancement of the field of informatics has made the extraction of these data feasible. These variables may improve the discriminative ability of 30-day readmission models which currently explain little of the variation in readmission rates among patients.  We propose to improve 30-day readmission models by extracting measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR using the novel method of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will combine administrative data (VA and Medicare) and data extracted from the national EHR in the VA for 6000 patients 65 and older in 2011 to improve upon currently available 30-day hospital readmission risk prediction models for congestive heart failure (CHF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia and stroke. We have chosen these conditions because hospital-level 30-day readmission rates for these conditions (CHF, AMI and pneumonia) are currently or will soon be (stroke) publicly reported. Our proposal has two goals: 1) to develop, test and evaluate automated NLP algorithms designed to extract measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR and 2) to understand the impact of these two novel domains on 30-day readmission across four conditions with fundamentally different post-discharge hospital course and disease trajectories.  We propose a paradigm shift in the understanding and obtainment of factors predictive of 30-day readmission. Our overarching hypothesis is that social risk factors and functional status which directly influence a patient's self-management ability are critical factors predictive of 30-day readmission, can be extracted from the EHR, and should be included in risk prediction models. The development of better risk prediction models will allow the identification of patients at highest risk of readmission and facilitate post-discharge interventions in their care. In addition, if social risk factors and functional status are criticalin explaining variation in 30-day readmission rates, then hospitals that care for patients with a higher burden of social risk and functional needs may be inappropriately penalized by current risk predictions models that lack these measures. Also, as more hospitals adopt EHRs, we need to study more advanced technologies such as automated NLP as tools to efficiently extract information and to inform health systems about the characteristics of the patients they serve. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About a fifth of all Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge, potentially exposing the patients and their families to distress and unnecessary costs. An improved understanding of who is at highest risk of readmission will allow hospitals to efficiently intervene in the care of patients who may benefit the most from post-discharge interventions.",An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission,9065737,R01HL116522,"['Accounting', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Management', 'Severity of illness', 'Social support', 'Stroke', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'disadvantaged population', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'functional status', 'health administration', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'hospital patient care', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'marginally housed', 'mortality', 'novel', 'payment', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'social', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2016,520282,0.03430047905610565
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry. This research is expected to impact the clinical management of AAA disease, as well as the pre-surgical planning capabilities of vascular and endovascular aneurysm repair.",Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,9041015,R01HL121293,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Aneurysm', 'Award', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pressure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'repaired', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2016,474831,0.03513185418698715
"Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT The purpose of this K07 proposal is to provide Jeffrey Lee, MD, MAS with the protected time and resources to pursue the additional training needed to reach his long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator, focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality for CRC. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps (adenomas) and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. With limited data available in the literature to determine the appropriate timing and frequency of follow-up colonoscopy for patients after adenoma removal, recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance from our national guidelines have been imprecise at best. For example, the currently recommended range of 5-10 years for a surveillance colonoscopy for patients with a single adenoma covers a two-fold difference in exam frequency, with resultant two-fold impact on patient risk, cost, and colonoscopy capacity. To help optimize the timing of colonoscopic surveillance and guide appropriate utilization of this invasive and costly resource, stratification of CRC risk after colonoscopic polypectomy from a large community-based cohort with long-term follow-up is needed. Building on his prior work in CRC screening, Dr. Lee seeks to fill this knowledge gap by optimizing surveillance practices in post-polypectomy patients according to patient-, polyp-, and colonoscopy exam-related factors. Specifically, he will determine the long- term CRC risk in patients after colonoscopic polypectomy in a very large “real world” community-based population (Aim 1). He will also identify patient-, polyp-, and exam-related risk factors associated with incident CRC in these patients (Aim 2). Finally, he will develop a CRC risk prediction model that will identify post- polypectomy patients at high and low risk for developing subsequent CRC (Aim 3). To achieve these goals, Dr. Lee and his mentors have designed a career development plan for research and educational training to obtain: 1) knowledge and expertise in advanced epidemiologic methods for design and analysis of cohort studies; 2) knowledge in medical informatics methods; and 3) predictive modeling skills. To achieve the proposed research aims, Dr. Lee will leverage the rich electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large community-based healthcare system, in which data on patient, physician, colonoscopy, pathology, and CRC status have been collected since 1994. In addition, Dr. Lee will use an established natural language processing tool to efficiently collect data and evaluate potential confounding variables from more than 600,000 colonoscopy reports in order to address one of the main practical challenges that have limited the feasibility of large-scale population-based studies. Thus, completion of these aims has the potential to improve prevention and early detection of CRC, impact current surveillance guidelines for post-polypectomy patients, and reduce overuse and underuse of surveillance colonoscopy. Importantly, this proposal is realistic and feasible within the award period and will allow Dr. Lee to continue to build research skills, generate preliminary data, create additional collaborative relationships, and compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K07 award will support and accelerate the career development activities of Dr. Lee and allow him to successfully launch into the next phase of his career as an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized controlled trials have shown that screening reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. Thus in this proposal, we will determine the long-term risk and risk factors of CRC after colonoscopic polypectomy, and develop a CRC risk prediction model to tailor surveillancein post- polypectomy patients using a large, community-based cohort.","Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort",9224101,K07CA212057,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancerous', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Polypectomy', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scheme', 'Stratification', 'Surveillance Program', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'skills', 'surveillance strategy', 'tool']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K07,2016,177057,0.04166201725213926
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.            ",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9027247,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Figs - dietary', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Staging', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'reward processing', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,1364412,0.0029457438145358865
"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",9115219,R01HL127028,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anthropometry', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dyspnea', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise stress test', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Galectin 3', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Spirometry', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'aged', 'arterial stiffness', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'exercise intolerance', 'fasting glucose', 'fitness', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'pressure', 'screening', 'statistics', 'trend']",NHLBI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,1900214,0.026791161407587784
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9164916,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FMR1', 'FMR1 Premutation', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2016,131004,0.02187495354293035
"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,9144793,R03OH010956,[' '],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2016,66564,0.017826497677069498

"Identification of patients with diabetes at high risk for treatment failure ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this project is to improve quality of care of patients with diabetes by identifying patients who may have particular difficulty reaching treatment targets and who could therefore potentially benefit from additional resources. Investigators propose to achieve this goal by developing a technology to accurately identify patients at high risk for not reaching blood glucose target to enable cost-effective implementation of resource-intensive interventions that improve glycemic control in high-risk individuals.  Improving blood glucose control in patients with diabetes could both improve their quality of life by reducing diabetes complications and decrease costs. Some patients that face particularly high barriers to glucose control may benefit from additional resources that are too expensive to apply to broad patient populations. However, it is not currently possible to identify patients at high risk not being able to reach blood glucose targets with sufficient accuracy to make these interventions cost-effective.  One reason for this is that a large fraction of critical information about the patients' functional status, social circumstances and other important factors that may present barriers to glucose control is only found in narrative documents, from which it is difficult to extract. Furthermore, the amount of information about any single patient i the medical record is enormous, and is impossible to process efficiently using standard analytical algorithms such as regression analysis.  In the proposed project investigators will combine two novel technologies - natural language processing of electronic provider notes and artificial intelligence technology Dynamic Logic - to help circumvent these challenges to build a high-accuracy model of risk of not being able to reach blood glucose targets in patients with diabetes. Natural language processing will identify key concepts documented in the provider notes and will help translate their text into a compendium of facts about the patient. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will therefore allow to greatly increasing the number of factors / variables that can be considered for the models for prediction of failure to reach glucose control, and ultimately improve their accuracy. Consequently this translational multidisciplinary project will both advance our understanding of the risk factors for not being able to reach glucose control for patients with diabetes and assist in real-life implementation of interventions that can help lower their blood glucose, decrease the rate of diabetes complications, improve the patients' quality of life and help control the rising costs of healthcare.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Lowering blood glucose of patients with diabetes could both improve their quality of life and reduce healthcare costs, but may be more difficult for some patients than others. Patients who have particularly high barriers to blood glucose control could benefit from extra resources, but it can be challenging to identify them in advance. In this projec the investigators will combine advanced computational technologies including artificial intelligence and natural language processing to identify patients with diabetes at high risk for difficulty lowering blood glucose to help make commitment of additional resources cost-effective.                ",Identification of patients with diabetes at high risk for treatment failure,8902473,R41DK105612,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Glucose', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Epidemic', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Language', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuropathy', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Failure', 'analytical method', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'combinatorial', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'functional status', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'social']",NIDDK,LP INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,R41,2015,223336,0.0009057776415890517
"Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone mass and structural deterioration leading to increased risk of fracture. Currently, osteoporosis is diagnosed by measurement of areal bone mineral density by dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the majority of fractures occur in both women and men who are not classified as osteoporotic by current DXA criteria (T-score = -2.5). As a 2-dimensional (2D) technology, DXA does not provide information about 3-dimensional (3D) bone structure, shape and geometry, which substantially contribute to bone strength and resistance to fracture. Finite element (FE) analysis of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images can provide 3D structure and strength measurements but QCT is impractical for widespread clinical use because of high radiation exposure and expense. In contrast, DXA is widely available, inexpensive and has low radiation exposure. What is needed is a method by which DXA images can be used to generate 3D shape models that incorporate bone structure and geometry. However, fractures are complex events influenced by other factors including age, race, body mass index, risk of falls, and prior medical and fracture history. Even sophisticated measurements of bone density, structure, and strength may not be able to predict fractures accurately. Machine learning is an emerging field in which models are created by ""learning"" from previous data. These models can incorporate various factors and be used to classify or predict outcomes for new data. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced analyses of widely available DXA images that incorporate structural and strength information and statistical modeling using machine learning to incorporate additional risk factors will better identify patient at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. This hypothesis will be tested using QCT and DXA data from previous studies to generate 3D statistical shape models that describe variability in proximal femur morphology. By aligning 2D DXA images to the models, patient-specific 3D models will be reconstructed for quantitative analyses and combined with FE analysis to estimate bone strength. Machine learning models will be used to incorporate these novel measurements, demographics, and various risk factors for fracture to predict incident fractures in two very large, prospective studies. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to increase the diagnostic utility of DXA, a safe, non-invasive, and widely available technology, by applying novel image processing and statistical techniques to predict fractures more accurately.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 are destined to suffer an osteoporotic fracture during their remaining lifetime. Unfortunately, the current standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, DXA, does not predict most fractures. This research will develop advanced analyses of DXA images and use machine learning to improve individualized fracture risk assessment.            ",Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA,8869145,K99AR067883,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'American', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Cadaver', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Height', 'Hip Fractures', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Osteopenia', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Postmenopause', 'Prospective Studies', 'Race', 'Radiation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'bone geometry', 'bone mass', 'bone strength', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnosis standard', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'men', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2015,91800,0.019689737232720935
"Novel whole-genome analysis methods for Alzheimer's risk prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) affects millions of elderly people in the United States, yet there are no well-established clinical guidelines for assessing a person's relative risk. Accurate assessment of lifetime risk for LOAD would give high-risk individuals the opportunity to undergo regular biomarker screening for signs of disease and to modify environmental risk factors or participate in prospective clinical trials. This Phase I SBIR project aims to develop a risk prediction model for LOAD that meets or exceeds the accuracy standards established in 1998 by the Working Group for Biochemical and Molecular Markers of Alzheimer's Disease. The recent release of whole-genome sequence data from an extensively phenotyped cohort of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative creates a unique opportunity to develop the methodology needed to successfully construct such a risk prediction model. The Parabon team will undertake three specific aims in pursuit of the final goal of producing a risk prediction model that can be used in the clinic. First, a novel methodology will be created for analyzing whole-genome sequence data to discover common SNPs, rare variants, and epistatic interactions that significantly associate with LOAD endophenotypes, the specific physiological changes that underlie disease. This will require innovative algorithm and software development, particularly the implementation of multi-objective optimization in our existing evolutionary search algorithm for detecting epistasis. Second, the discovered significant variants will be built into risk prediction models for each endophenotype using state-of-the-art machine learning methods. These models will then be combined into a single predictive model for lifetime risk, which will be validated in an independent cohort from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. Finally, to quantify the confidence associated with each prediction made by the model, algorithms and software for calculating confidence intervals will be developed and implemented. Each new prediction will be presented with a measure of confidence to enable clinicians to determine what, if any, intervention is necessary. When these aims have been completed, Parabon will have produced the first clinically relevant genetic risk prediction model for late-onset Alzheimer's Disease, as well as a suite of software that can be used in the development of other diagnostics. In Phase II, we will move beyond the ADNI-supplied endophenotypes, using image processing and deep learning to infer neuroimaging features most relevant to AD diagnoses, as well as work to validate the predictive models in a larger, more diverse cohort across multiple sites.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This Phase I SBIR aims to develop a highly accurate predictive model for lifetime risk of late-onset Alzheimer's Disease to enable early identification of high-risk individuals for participation in clinical trials and regular screening for signs of disease. In pursuit of this goal, the Parabon team will develop algorithms and software to build a novel methodology for the analysis of whole-genome sequence data and endophenotype measures from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.            ",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9032882,K01MH106710,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Surveys', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reading', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rosa', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Self-Administered', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stressful Event', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'salivary assay', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2015,166893,0.028468679686890954
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,8896079,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'human Huntingtin protein', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2015,339691,0.007091628916806313
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8788442,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2015,129546,0.04717841291768421
"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.            ","Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies",8986398,R01AA024391,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dependence', 'Distal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Heart Rate', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'coping', 'cost', 'craving', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'model development', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'real time model', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'stressor']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2015,381818,-0.025486330897025972
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,8921191,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K25,2015,159162,0.007436774662520224
"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization. Given the rapidly rising numbers of patients with dementia, reducing potentially preventable hospitalization could have an enormous impact on public health.",Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms,8911756,K08AG048321,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Bioinformatics', 'Capsicum', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kale - dietary', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleeplessness', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'behavior change', 'career', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'geriatric mental health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'neuropsychiatry', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2015,175103,0.01968435798819263
"An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed to financially penalize hospitals that have 30-day readmission rates above the national mean. As a result hospitals caring for disadvantaged populations with more needs might be penalized by current 30-day readmission models that do not include measures of social risk and functional status of the patients served. These are two important variable domains that directly impact a patient's ability to manage their disease. Social risk factors (e.g. living alone, social support, marginal housing, and alcohol abuse) and functional status (e.g. mobility, fall risk) are rarely present in administrative data, which is why so few readmission models include this data. Yet many of these variables are available in electronic health records (EHR) and the advancement of the field of informatics has made the extraction of these data feasible. These variables may improve the discriminative ability of 30-day readmission models which currently explain little of the variation in readmission rates among patients.  We propose to improve 30-day readmission models by extracting measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR using the novel method of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will combine administrative data (VA and Medicare) and data extracted from the national EHR in the VA for 6000 patients 65 and older in 2011 to improve upon currently available 30-day hospital readmission risk prediction models for congestive heart failure (CHF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia and stroke. We have chosen these conditions because hospital-level 30-day readmission rates for these conditions (CHF, AMI and pneumonia) are currently or will soon be (stroke) publicly reported. Our proposal has two goals: 1) to develop, test and evaluate automated NLP algorithms designed to extract measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR and 2) to understand the impact of these two novel domains on 30-day readmission across four conditions with fundamentally different post-discharge hospital course and disease trajectories.  We propose a paradigm shift in the understanding and obtainment of factors predictive of 30-day readmission. Our overarching hypothesis is that social risk factors and functional status which directly influence a patient's self-management ability are critical factors predictive of 30-day readmission, can be extracted from the EHR, and should be included in risk prediction models. The development of better risk prediction models will allow the identification of patients at highest risk of readmission and facilitate post-discharge interventions in their care. In addition, if social risk factors and functional status are criticalin explaining variation in 30-day readmission rates, then hospitals that care for patients with a higher burden of social risk and functional needs may be inappropriately penalized by current risk predictions models that lack these measures. Also, as more hospitals adopt EHRs, we need to study more advanced technologies such as automated NLP as tools to efficiently extract information and to inform health systems about the characteristics of the patients they serve. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About a fifth of all Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge, potentially exposing the patients and their families to distress and unnecessary costs. An improved understanding of who is at highest risk of readmission will allow hospitals to efficiently intervene in the care of patients who may benefit the most from post-discharge interventions.",An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission,8854133,R01HL116522,"['Accounting', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Management', 'Severity of illness', 'Social support', 'Stroke', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'functional status', 'health administration', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'hospital patient care', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'marginally housed', 'mortality', 'novel', 'payment', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'social', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2015,706251,0.03430047905610565
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry. This research is expected to impact the clinical management of AAA disease, as well as the pre-surgical planning capabilities of vascular and endovascular aneurysm repair.            ",Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,8888896,R01HL121293,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Aneurysm', 'Award', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pressure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'repaired', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2015,514370,0.03513185418698715
"Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contradiction of early cancer detection is that while some benefit others receive a detrimental diagnosis. A definitive example is mammography and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS, which most frequently presents as a non-palpable lesion, was rarely detected before the advent of modern mammography. Since 1983 there has been a 290% increase in DCIS incidence in women under 50 and 500% in those over 50. Given that only 5-10% of DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer with a 10-year mortality rate of 1-2%, DCIS experts suggest breast conservation for the majority of patients. However, these women continue to be overtreated with mastectomy and radiation, at rates comparable to those with invasive cancer. The inability to discern those at low vs. high risk is due in part to non-reproducible study results as well as inadequate statistical methods for risk prediction and validation.  We have collected a population-based DCIS cohort with the goal of delineating those women least likely to recur with invasive cancer and, hence, appropriate candidates for less aggressive treatments. Recently we established risk indices and published the corresponding absolute risk estimates for type of recurrence. However, two features of the study design, namely the presence of competing risks and the use of a stratified case-cohort design, constrained us to using crude empirical methods for analysis and left us unable to validate the clinical utility of our models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a unified, principled statistical framework for building, selecting, and evaluating clinically relevant risk indices, permitting refinement and validation of existing risk prediction models in our DCIS study as well as beyond.  We face multiple challenges including how to objectively build risk indices with relevant variables; how to estimate the corresponding risks (competing or not) in various subsample study designs; and, how to validate the resulting risk prediction models. Recently, we developed partDSA, a tree-based method which affords tremendous flexibility in building predictive models and provides an ideal foundation for developing a clinician- friendly tool for accurate stratification and risk prediction. In its curret form, partDSA is unable to estimate absolute risk in the presence of competing risks accounting for subsample study designs. Here we extend partDSA for such clinically relevant scenarios (Aim 1). We also propose aggregate learning for risk prediction to increase prediction accuracy and subsequently to build more stable but easily interpretable risk models (Aim 2). Finally, we propose the necessary methods for validating the resulting models (Aim 3).  Our proposal has two immediate public health benefits: first, these novel statistical methods will result in a clinician-friendly, publicly available tool for accurate risk prediction, stratification and validaion in numerous clinical settings; second, current DCIS risk models will be refined and validated with the expectation of better delineating those at low risk, hence strong candidates for conservative treatments including active surveillance.          Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.

"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.                ","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",8864355,R01HL127028,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anthropometry', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dyspnea', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Exercise stress test', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Galectin 3', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Spirometry', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'aged', 'arterial stiffness', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'fasting glucose', 'fitness', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'novel', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'statistics', 'trend']",NHLBI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,1974550,0.026791161407587784
"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.            ",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,8953935,R03OH010956,[' '],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2015,66904,0.017826497677069498
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.            ",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,8721037,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'human Huntingtin protein', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2014,359539,0.007091628916806313
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.            ",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8617518,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2014,129546,0.04717841291768421
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field.

"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization. Given the rapidly rising numbers of patients with dementia, reducing potentially preventable hospitalization could have an enormous impact on public health.            ",Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms,8769634,K08AG048321,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kale - dietary', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleeplessness', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'behavior change', 'career', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'geriatric mental health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'neuropsychiatry', 'patient population', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2014,175103,0.01968435798819263
"An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed to financially penalize hospitals that have 30-day readmission rates above the national mean. As a result hospitals caring for disadvantaged populations with more needs might be penalized by current 30-day readmission models that do not include measures of social risk and functional status of the patients served. These are two important variable domains that directly impact a patient's ability to manage their disease. Social risk factors (e.g. living alone, social support, marginal housing, and alcohol abuse) and functional status (e.g. mobility, fall risk) are rarely present in administrative data, which is why so few readmission models include this data. Yet many of these variables are available in electronic health records (EHR) and the advancement of the field of informatics has made the extraction of these data feasible. These variables may improve the discriminative ability of 30-day readmission models which currently explain little of the variation in readmission rates among patients.  We propose to improve 30-day readmission models by extracting measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR using the novel method of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will combine administrative data (VA and Medicare) and data extracted from the national EHR in the VA for 6000 patients 65 and older in 2011 to improve upon currently available 30-day hospital readmission risk prediction models for congestive heart failure (CHF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia and stroke. We have chosen these conditions because hospital-level 30-day readmission rates for these conditions (CHF, AMI and pneumonia) are currently or will soon be (stroke) publicly reported. Our proposal has two goals: 1) to develop, test and evaluate automated NLP algorithms designed to extract measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR and 2) to understand the impact of these two novel domains on 30-day readmission across four conditions with fundamentally different post-discharge hospital course and disease trajectories.  We propose a paradigm shift in the understanding and obtainment of factors predictive of 30-day readmission. Our overarching hypothesis is that social risk factors and functional status which directly influence a patient's self-management ability are critical factors predictive of 30-day readmission, can be extracted from the EHR, and should be included in risk prediction models. The development of better risk prediction models will allow the identification of patients at highest risk of readmission and facilitate post-discharge interventions in their care. In addition, if social risk factors and functional status are criticalin explaining variation in 30-day readmission rates, then hospitals that care for patients with a higher burden of social risk and functional needs may be inappropriately penalized by current risk predictions models that lack these measures. Also, as more hospitals adopt EHRs, we need to study more advanced technologies such as automated NLP as tools to efficiently extract information and to inform health systems about the characteristics of the patients they serve.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About a fifth of all Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge, potentially exposing the patients and their families to distress and unnecessary costs. An improved understanding of who is at highest risk of readmission will allow hospitals to efficiently intervene in the care of patients who may benefit the most from post-discharge interventions.",An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission,8720810,R01HL116522,"['Accounting', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Management', 'Severity of illness', 'Social support', 'Stroke', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'functional status', 'health administration', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'hospital patient care', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'marginally housed', 'mortality', 'novel', 'payment', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2014,718710,0.03430047905610565
"Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contradiction of early cancer detection is that while some benefit others receive a detrimental diagnosis. A definitive example is mammography and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS, which most frequently presents as a non-palpable lesion, was rarely detected before the advent of modern mammography. Since 1983 there has been a 290% increase in DCIS incidence in women under 50 and 500% in those over 50. Given that only 5-10% of DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer with a 10-year mortality rate of 1-2%, DCIS experts suggest breast conservation for the majority of patients. However, these women continue to be overtreated with mastectomy and radiation, at rates comparable to those with invasive cancer. The inability to discern those at low vs. high risk is due in part to non-reproducible study results as well as inadequate statistical methods for risk prediction and validation.  We have collected a population-based DCIS cohort with the goal of delineating those women least likely to recur with invasive cancer and, hence, appropriate candidates for less aggressive treatments. Recently we established risk indices and published the corresponding absolute risk estimates for type of recurrence. However, two features of the study design, namely the presence of competing risks and the use of a stratified case-cohort design, constrained us to using crude empirical methods for analysis and left us unable to validate the clinical utility of our models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a unified, principled statistical framework for building, selecting, and evaluating clinically relevant risk indices, permitting refinement and validation of existing risk prediction models in our DCIS study as well as beyond.  We face multiple challenges including how to objectively build risk indices with relevant variables; how to estimate the corresponding risks (competing or not) in various subsample study designs; and, how to validate the resulting risk prediction models. Recently, we developed partDSA, a tree-based method which affords tremendous flexibility in building predictive models and provides an ideal foundation for developing a clinician- friendly tool for accurate stratification and risk prediction. In its curret form, partDSA is unable to estimate absolute risk in the presence of competing risks accounting for subsample study designs. Here we extend partDSA for such clinically relevant scenarios (Aim 1). We also propose aggregate learning for risk prediction to increase prediction accuracy and subsequently to build more stable but easily interpretable risk models (Aim 2). Finally, we propose the necessary methods for validating the resulting models (Aim 3).  Our proposal has two immediate public health benefits: first, these novel statistical methods will result in a clinician-friendly, publicly available tool for accurate risk prediction, stratification and validaion in numerous clinical settings; second, current DCIS risk models will be refined and validated with the expectation of better delineating those at low risk, hence strong candidates for conservative treatments including active surveillance.          Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.

"Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since receiving the K24 award, I have established a successful clinical research and training program in patient-oriented research (POR) in rheumatic disease with a focus on genetic, biomarker, and environmental risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). I continue to have independent grant support, and have mentored 15 new clinical investigators who have published 25 peer- reviewed papers during the K24 period. Three mentees have received NIH K awards and one has received an NIH R01. With renewal of the K24, I would continue to have protected time to devote to this program that has a unique training environment and an array of important POR projects. Genetic and environmental epidemiology studies have produced convincing evidence for multiple alleles and exposures as RA risk factors. A strong gene-environment (GXE) interaction between HLA-DRB1 alleles and smoking has been demonstrated for risk of the immune phenotype of CCP positive RA but not CCP negative RA. As CCP antibodies occur years before RA onset, I hypothesize that this interaction induces anti-citrulline immunity, a critical step in RA pathogenesis. These findings emphasize the need to study genes, environment and immunity with careful phenotyping. Family history encompasses unmeasured genetic and environmental risk, yet is not measured accurately in other studies including those in my research portfolio. Specific aims are to: 1) Maintain and expand my clinical research training program by mentoring new clinical investigators in POR in rheumatic diseases; 2) Enrich my comprehensive POR program to study family history, genetic, and environmental predictors in the etiology of RA using a new collection of RA cases and controls from Partners HealthCare; 2a) Collect family history data and environmental exposure data concerning smoking and reproductive factors on 1,500 RA patients and 4,500 age- and gender-matched controls by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) queries of electronic medical records; 2b: Examine genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors and GXE in predicting immune phenotypes of RA: RA with and without CCP antibodies (CCP?), and RA with and without rheumatoid factor antibodies (RF?); and 2c: Apply this comprehensive risk model to RA cases and controls and to subsets of RA stratified by specific immune phenotypes and stratified by family history of RA and other autoimmune diseases. The proposed study will leverage the NIH funded Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside study that used an advanced informatics infrastructure to extract clinical data on RA diagnostic features through database mining and NLP. A highly specific algorithm was used to identify RA cases and collect samples from cases and controls. The NLP techniques will be used to extract risk factor data from clinical notes. This proposal builds on my strong track record of POR, extending the work to add family history from a new case-control collection, validate data by patient interview, and develop predictive models for risk of RA that can be used to select high risk individuals for future RA prevention trials. Project Narrative  Innovative predictive modeling incorporating family history, genes, environmental exposures, and geneenvironment interactions, is a key step in the progress towards an RA prevention clinical trial.","Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk",8664806,K24AR052403,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Citrulline', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exogenous Hormone Therapy', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Grant', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Healthcare', 'ICD-9', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'PTPN22 gene', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Pollution', 'Prevention', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'STAT4 gene', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Smoking', 'Sushi Domain', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'TNF receptor-associated factor 1', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive modeling', 'prevention clinical trial', 'programs', 'research study', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'trafficking']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2014,157939,-0.004262192418293676
"Individualized Risk Assessment in Patients with Multiple, Chronic Conditions     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proportions of patients aged 50 years or older with multiple chronic conditions having surgical procedures are estimated to double in the next 50 years. More than 80 million surgical procedures are performed each year in the United States; these procedures are also increasingly being performed in those with multiple chronic conditions. These patients have the greatest risk of serious complications and procedure-related deaths. Although complication rates from major surgery rise with age and multiple conditions, the effect of specific combinations or sequences of comorbid conditions on outcome is not well understood. Identifying patients at increased risk for complications and adverse outcomes is critical to direct healthcare teams to adjust techniques or interventions, improve decision-making and quality improvement. The most common technique used to quantify the burden of health conditions using secondary data are comorbidity indices, or numeric scores based on a summation of the number of conditions that apply pre-determined ""weights"" to give certain conditions more importance over others. Comorbidity indices, however, are subject to several limitations and have not been widely incorporated into the routine assessment of patients in clinical care. The availability of a reliable, easy to use and accessible risk prediction tool for adverse events in surgery is essential. We hypothesize that the current techniques for assessing and predicting the relationship of multiple health conditions and outcome may be improved by: 1) using condition specific diagnoses and condition specific outcomes 2) evaluating specific combinations of conditions to assess if their contribution to the risk of outcome is something other than additive and, 3) determining if the temporal sequence of conditions contributes to the prediction of risk beyond the conventional assessment of whether the conditions are present at all. The last decade has seen a rapid increase in the number of available techniques for building predictive models, especially targeting applications with much larger numbers of attributes. This project applies a novel risk prediction strategy to a nationally representative administrative claims database, including longitudinal records from millions of patients. The focus of the project is on the enhanced risk prediction ability of novel dynamic statistical models that will relate the timing, sequence, combination, and clustering of chronic conditions to effectiveness, safety, resource use and cost of the 10 most commonly performed major elective surgical procedures. These novel risk prediction models will utilize dynamic statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to create an easy to use, interactive risk prediction platform. Successfully improving upon a risk prediction tool for adverse events in surgery will better inform patient-centered decision-making, direct healthcare teams to adjust techniques and interventions, help target quality improvement interventions, allow more equitable reimbursement activities and even support accountable care organization activities that rely on accurate estimates of population risk and health.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 80 million surgical procedures are performed each year in the United States, increasingly among older patients and those with multiple chronic conditions. Identifying patients at increased risk for complications and adverse outcomes is critical to help inform patient-centered decision-making, direct healthcare teams to adjust techniques and interventions, help target quality improvement interventions, allow more equitable reimbursement activities and even support accountable care organization activities that rely on accurate estimates of population risk and health. Sensitive techniques for risk stratification based on secondary data are necessary, and we propose a novel flexible statistical framework to the use of longitudinal patient data, which defines predictor characteristics for every comorbid condition and relates these to outcome.              ","Individualized Risk Assessment in Patients with Multiple, Chronic Conditions",8725922,R21HS023080,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2014,165816,0.020537914438756827
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes.

"Exploring the Feasibility of Computational Markers to Predict Atrial Fibrillation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postoperative atrial fibrillation (PAF) affects a large fraction of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. It is associated with increased postoperative mortality and morbidity, and also results in longer and more expensive hospital stays. While treatments such as prophylactic administration of beta-adrenergic blockers and amiodarone can reduce the incidence of PAF, existing tools to match patients to treatments that are appropriate for their risk need to be improved. Many high-risk patients may benefit from more aggressive treatment than they receive presently. Conversely, many low-risk patients are currently treated in excess of their actual risk of developing PAF. The aim of our research is to develop novel computational markers that can be used to risk stratify patients undergoing cardiac surgery for PAF. Our research uses sophisticated signal processing and machine learning techniques to discover information in the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal related to autonomic and impulse conduction abnormalities. We describe how this information can be combined with existing metrics to identify high risk patients. In addition, we propose the creation of a large public dataset of ECG signals with detailed patient meta-data and outcomes for research by the broader scientific community on predicting PAF. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To develop a public database with ECG signals and detailed patient metadata for research on predictive PAF. We will collect ECG data from over 900 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the University of Michigan Medical Center during the first 12 months of this project with an expected PAF incidence of around 30%. We will share this data and other clinical information (i.e., demographics, comorbidities, laboratory reports, information related to the procedure, and the outcome of PAF) in a de- identified manner with the broader research community through PhysioNet; and (2) To develop and validate novel ECG-based risk markers for PAF. We will explore metrics based on the sympathovagal modulation of the heart, e.g., heart rate turbulence (HRT) and deceleration capacity (DC), which have shown recent promise in predicting ventricular arrhythmias. We will also develop new metrics based on the shape of the ECG to assess atrial myocardial instability. These approaches will be validated on the data collected in Aim 1, and will be used to develop models based on non-parametric machine learning techniques to accurately assess PAF risk.           Postoperative atrial fibrillation commonly occurs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (e.g., coronary artery bypass graft or valve repair). It is associated with an increased risk of both mortality and morbidity, and increases the cost of hospitalization significantly. Successful management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery therefore relies on the ability of clinicians to estimate the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation, and ideally, to anticipate and prevent this event. We propose to develop low-cost, and widely applicable methods that would improve the ability of physicians to identify patients at high risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation. They key concept for this proposal is that ECG signals contain valuable information that can help predict high or low risk cases using sophisticated techniques from signal processing and machine learning. This information can be used to develop clinical tools to improve management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In addition to developing these tools, we also propose the creation of a large public database that can help other researchers with an interest in predicting postoperative atrial fibrillation.",Exploring the Feasibility of Computational Markers to Predict Atrial Fibrillation,8484439,R21LM011026,"['Address', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Amiodarone', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Blinded', 'Bradycardia', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deceleration', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitalization', 'Incidence', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Marker', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Universities', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'demographics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'millisecond', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prophylactic', 'repaired', 'tool', 'valve replacement']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2013,152303,0.045471087410602136
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.        ",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,8425985,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K25,2013,161180,0.007436774662520224
"An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed to financially penalize hospitals that have 30-day readmission rates above the national mean. As a result hospitals caring for disadvantaged populations with more needs might be penalized by current 30-day readmission models that do not include measures of social risk and functional status of the patients served. These are two important variable domains that directly impact a patient's ability to manage their disease. Social risk factors (e.g. living alone, social support, marginal housing, and alcohol abuse) and functional status (e.g. mobility, fall risk) are rarely present in administrative data, which is why so few readmission models include this data. Yet many of these variables are available in electronic health records (EHR) and the advancement of the field of informatics has made the extraction of these data feasible. These variables may improve the discriminative ability of 30-day readmission models which currently explain little of the variation in readmission rates among patients.  We propose to improve 30-day readmission models by extracting measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR using the novel method of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will combine administrative data (VA and Medicare) and data extracted from the national EHR in the VA for 6000 patients 65 and older in 2011 to improve upon currently available 30-day hospital readmission risk prediction models for congestive heart failure (CHF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia and stroke. We have chosen these conditions because hospital-level 30-day readmission rates for these conditions (CHF, AMI and pneumonia) are currently or will soon be (stroke) publicly reported. Our proposal has two goals: 1) to develop, test and evaluate automated NLP algorithms designed to extract measures of social risk and functional status from the EHR and 2) to understand the impact of these two novel domains on 30-day readmission across four conditions with fundamentally different post-discharge hospital course and disease trajectories.  We propose a paradigm shift in the understanding and obtainment of factors predictive of 30-day readmission. Our overarching hypothesis is that social risk factors and functional status which directly influence a patient's self-management ability are critical factors predictive of 30-day readmission, can be extracted from the EHR, and should be included in risk prediction models. The development of better risk prediction models will allow the identification of patients at highest risk of readmission and facilitate post-discharge interventions in their care. In addition, if social risk factors and functional status are criticalin explaining variation in 30-day readmission rates, then hospitals that care for patients with a higher burden of social risk and functional needs may be inappropriately penalized by current risk predictions models that lack these measures. Also, as more hospitals adopt EHRs, we need to study more advanced technologies such as automated NLP as tools to efficiently extract information and to inform health systems about the characteristics of the patients they serve.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About a fifth of all Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge, potentially exposing the patients and their families to distress and unnecessary costs. An improved understanding of who is at highest risk of readmission will allow hospitals to efficiently intervene in the care of patients who may benefit the most from post-discharge interventions.                ",An Evaluation of Novel Domains for Predicting 30-Day Readmission,8576427,R01HL116522,"['Accounting', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Management', 'Severity of illness', 'Social support', 'Stroke', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'functional status', 'health administration', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'hospital patient care', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'marginally housed', 'mortality', 'novel', 'payment', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2013,738594,0.03430047905610565
"Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contradiction of early cancer detection is that while some benefit others receive a detrimental diagnosis. A definitive example is mammography and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS, which most frequently presents as a non-palpable lesion, was rarely detected before the advent of modern mammography. Since 1983 there has been a 290% increase in DCIS incidence in women under 50 and 500% in those over 50. Given that only 5-10% of DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer with a 10-year mortality rate of 1-2%, DCIS experts suggest breast conservation for the majority of patients. However, these women continue to be overtreated with mastectomy and radiation, at rates comparable to those with invasive cancer. The inability to discern those at low vs. high risk is due in part to non-reproducible study results as well as inadequate statistical methods for risk prediction and validation.  We have collected a population-based DCIS cohort with the goal of delineating those women least likely to recur with invasive cancer and, hence, appropriate candidates for less aggressive treatments. Recently we established risk indices and published the corresponding absolute risk estimates for type of recurrence. However, two features of the study design, namely the presence of competing risks and the use of a stratified case-cohort design, constrained us to using crude empirical methods for analysis and left us unable to validate the clinical utility of our models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a unified, principled statistical framework for building, selecting, and evaluating clinically relevant risk indices, permitting refinement and validation of existing risk prediction models in our DCIS study as well as beyond.  We face multiple challenges including how to objectively build risk indices with relevant variables; how to estimate the corresponding risks (competing or not) in various subsample study designs; and, how to validate the resulting risk prediction models. Recently, we developed partDSA, a tree-based method which affords tremendous flexibility in building predictive models and provides an ideal foundation for developing a clinician- friendly tool for accurate stratification and risk prediction. In its curret form, partDSA is unable to estimate absolute risk in the presence of competing risks accounting for subsample study designs. Here we extend partDSA for such clinically relevant scenarios (Aim 1). We also propose aggregate learning for risk prediction to increase prediction accuracy and subsequently to build more stable but easily interpretable risk models (Aim 2). Finally, we propose the necessary methods for validating the resulting models (Aim 3).  Our proposal has two immediate public health benefits: first, these novel statistical methods will result in a clinician-friendly, publicly available tool for accurate risk prediction, stratification and validaion in numerous clinical settings; second, current DCIS risk models will be refined and validated with the expectation of better delineating those at low risk, hence strong candidates for conservative treatments including active surveillance.          Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.

"Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since receiving the K24 award, I have established a successful clinical research and training program in patient-oriented research (POR) in rheumatic disease with a focus on genetic, biomarker, and environmental risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). I continue to have independent grant support, and have mentored 15 new clinical investigators who have published 25 peer- reviewed papers during the K24 period. Three mentees have received NIH K awards and one has received an NIH R01. With renewal of the K24, I would continue to have protected time to devote to this program that has a unique training environment and an array of important POR projects. Genetic and environmental epidemiology studies have produced convincing evidence for multiple alleles and exposures as RA risk factors. A strong gene-environment (GXE) interaction between HLA-DRB1 alleles and smoking has been demonstrated for risk of the immune phenotype of CCP positive RA but not CCP negative RA. As CCP antibodies occur years before RA onset, I hypothesize that this interaction induces anti-citrulline immunity, a critical step in RA pathogenesis. These findings emphasize the need to study genes, environment and immunity with careful phenotyping. Family history encompasses unmeasured genetic and environmental risk, yet is not measured accurately in other studies including those in my research portfolio. Specific aims are to: 1) Maintain and expand my clinical research training program by mentoring new clinical investigators in POR in rheumatic diseases; 2) Enrich my comprehensive POR program to study family history, genetic, and environmental predictors in the etiology of RA using a new collection of RA cases and controls from Partners HealthCare; 2a) Collect family history data and environmental exposure data concerning smoking and reproductive factors on 1,500 RA patients and 4,500 age- and gender-matched controls by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) queries of electronic medical records; 2b: Examine genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors and GXE in predicting immune phenotypes of RA: RA with and without CCP antibodies (CCP?), and RA with and without rheumatoid factor antibodies (RF?); and 2c: Apply this comprehensive risk model to RA cases and controls and to subsets of RA stratified by specific immune phenotypes and stratified by family history of RA and other autoimmune diseases. The proposed study will leverage the NIH funded Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside study that used an advanced informatics infrastructure to extract clinical data on RA diagnostic features through database mining and NLP. A highly specific algorithm was used to identify RA cases and collect samples from cases and controls. The NLP techniques will be used to extract risk factor data from clinical notes. This proposal builds on my strong track record of POR, extending the work to add family history from a new case-control collection, validate data by patient interview, and develop predictive models for risk of RA that can be used to select high risk individuals for future RA prevention trials. Project Narrative  Innovative predictive modeling incorporating family history, genes, environmental exposures, and geneenvironment interactions, is a key step in the progress towards an RA prevention clinical trial.","Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk",8485543,K24AR052403,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Citrulline', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exogenous Hormone Therapy', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Grant', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Healthcare', 'ICD-9', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'PTPN22 gene', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Pollution', 'Prevention', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'STAT4 gene', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Smoking', 'Sushi Domain', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'TNF receptor-associated factor 1', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive modeling', 'prevention clinical trial', 'programs', 'research study', 'sample collection', 'trafficking']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2013,157939,-0.004262192418293676
"Exploring the Feasibility of Computational Markers to Predict Atrial Fibrillation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postoperative atrial fibrillation (PAF) affects a large fraction of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. It is associated with increased postoperative mortality and morbidity, and also results in longer and more expensive hospital stays. While treatments such as prophylactic administration of beta-adrenergic blockers and amiodarone can reduce the incidence of PAF, existing tools to match patients to treatments that are appropriate for their risk need to be improved. Many high-risk patients may benefit from more aggressive treatment than they receive presently. Conversely, many low-risk patients are currently treated in excess of their actual risk of developing PAF. The aim of our research is to develop novel computational markers that can be used to risk stratify patients undergoing cardiac surgery for PAF. Our research uses sophisticated signal processing and machine learning techniques to discover information in the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal related to autonomic and impulse conduction abnormalities. We describe how this information can be combined with existing metrics to identify high risk patients. In addition, we propose the creation of a large public dataset of ECG signals with detailed patient meta-data and outcomes for research by the broader scientific community on predicting PAF. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To develop a public database with ECG signals and detailed patient metadata for research on predictive PAF. We will collect ECG data from over 900 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the University of Michigan Medical Center during the first 12 months of this project with an expected PAF incidence of around 30%. We will share this data and other clinical information (i.e., demographics, comorbidities, laboratory reports, information related to the procedure, and the outcome of PAF) in a de- identified manner with the broader research community through PhysioNet; and (2) To develop and validate novel ECG-based risk markers for PAF. We will explore metrics based on the sympathovagal modulation of the heart, e.g., heart rate turbulence (HRT) and deceleration capacity (DC), which have shown recent promise in predicting ventricular arrhythmias.

"Exploring the Feasibility of Approximate Sequential Pattern Discovery in Massive    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to predict the clinical course of intensive care unit (ICU) patients in a timely manner can guide decision making and accelerate research into therapeutic efforts and the economics of care. To achieve this, a variety of ICU-based risk scoring systems have been proposed to risk stratify patients using ""snapshots"" of variables at specific points in time. These systems are not designed to provide a continuous assessment of patient status in real-time. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in intelligent patient monitoring (IPM) systems that can use information in continuously recorded ICU signals to recognize changes suggestive of dangerous pathophysiologieis. The aim of our research is to augment the knowledge base for these IPM systems by exploring the feasibility of pattern discovery methods to identify novel markers of future risk from large volumes of continuous ICU data. We focus, in particular, on sophisticated methods from data mining and machine learning that are computationally efficient, robust, and able to identify multi-parameter time-series trends useful for risk stratification. To facilitate these efforts, we will utilize the high volume acuity environment of the Surgical ICU (SICU) at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. We will study the use of pattern discovery methods to identify high and low risk patterns in historical data from over 5,000 patients admitted to the SICU, and then prospectively evaluate our findings on real-time SICU data at the Henry Ford from over 3,700 patients. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to develop novel decision support tools based on high and low risk patterns discovered from large historical time-series ICU datasets. Using fully-automated and computationally efficient algorithms, we will first identify characteristic units of temporal activity that explain the multi-parameter physiological time-series for ICU patients, and then discover approximate sequences of these characteristic units associated with adverse events in patients with known outcomes. The patterns discovered using our approach will be integrated into real-time decision support tools to signal alerts when high risk patterns are observed; and (2) to prospectively validate decision support tools based on high and low risk patterns in ICU time-series on real-time ICU data. We will conduct a pilot study validating these tools by studying the association between the predictions for these tools and actual adverse outcomes observed in the SICU. Each tool will be evaluated based on the following metrics: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and clinical time-frame of prediction. We will further compare the improvement provided by these tools to existing risk scoring systems.           Project Narrative Successful management of critical care patients depends on the ability of clinicians to estimate the risk of future adverse events, and ideally, to anticipate and prevent those events. We propose to explore low-cost, and widely applicable methods that would improve the ability of physicians to identify patients at high risk for adverse events in real time in ICU settings. The key concept for this proposal is that time-series data collected in the ICU contain valuable prognostic information that can be extracted using novel, sophisticated techniques drawn from the domains of machine learning and data mining.

"A New Hip Fracture Risk Prediction Tool Based on Common Predictors and Hip Geomer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health problem. Women are at a particularly high risk for osteoporosis and 50% of women age 50 or older may suffer from a fragility fracture in their remaining lifetime. Hip fractures are the most detrimental type of fractures. Research has been conducted to assess hip fracture risk so prevention methods could be used to reduce this risk in the growing number of older women. However, previous risk assessment approaches are limited to a few variables and linear combinations of these factors. Also, there is an increasing number of available measures, such as bone structures and skeletal muscle mass, that can be extracted, for instance, from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and no reliable risk prediction model exist based on this wealth of information. The overall goal of this study is to develop a comprehensive and flexible model to assess the risk of hip fracture for a specific woman. This will be achieved by constructing a novel predictor that classifies data that include hip structural geometry, sarcopenia measurements as well as risk factors identified in previous studies. The construction of the predictive model will be partly based on a study conducted among a large (n = 11,432) multi-ethnic bone cohort from the nationwide Women's Health Initiative (WHI). In addition, to enhance the quality of the risk prediction, computational data from finite element simulations will be used. There are three specific aims. The first aim is to generate a risk model, based on clinical data that accounts for the coupling effects of the factors involved in hip fracture. This research introduces a new approach in the field of hip fracture, Support Vector Machines (SVM), which explicitly identifies the configurations of factors that are likely to lead to hip fracture. The second aim is to refine the prediction/decision model from the first aim using both the SVM classifier and finite element modeling. A scheme has been developed to select, in a high dimensional space, data points that would improve the accuracy of the SVM-based risk prediction model. These data points would be evaluated (fracture or not) using a finite element model. The novelty of the proposed finite element model stems from its full parameterization so that the variability of the bone response can be studied with respect to variations (even small) of structural geometry and material parameters. The third aim is to validate and compare the SVM-based risk with and without the use of finite element analysis and develop a hip fracture risk calculator for the web. A cross validation will be performed using data sets from the WHI as well as other cohorts. The flexibility of the SVM classification approach makes it easily deployable on the Internet. This study will be carried out using existing cohorts by an interdisciplinary team with experience in epidemiology of osteoporosis research, DXA measurements including hip structures and sarcopenia, fracture assessments, biostatistics approaches for large datasets, high dimensional analysis and finite element modeling, thus making this study highly feasible. The study results will have an extremely significant public health impact by providing an innovative tool for hip fracture risk assessments.        This study will use innovative approaches, existing cohort resources, and interdisciplinary expertise to address a significant public health challenge: assessing the risk of hip fracture, the most detrimental type of fragility fractures. The study aims for a better risk assessment tool on the web that can be used by researchers and clinicians to assess an individual's hip fracture risk. This research will test new predictors and use the assumption free modeling approach to capture complex and non-linear relationships of predictors with fracture risk.

"Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contradiction of early cancer detection is that while some benefit others receive a detrimental diagnosis. A definitive example is mammography and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS, which most frequently presents as a non-palpable lesion, was rarely detected before the advent of modern mammography. Since 1983 there has been a 290% increase in DCIS incidence in women under 50 and 500% in those over 50. Given that only 5-10% of DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer with a 10-year mortality rate of 1-2%, DCIS experts suggest breast conservation for the majority of patients. However, these women continue to be overtreated with mastectomy and radiation, at rates comparable to those with invasive cancer. The inability to discern those at low vs. high risk is due in part to non-reproducible study results as well as inadequate statistical methods for risk prediction and validation.  We have collected a population-based DCIS cohort with the goal of delineating those women least likely to recur with invasive cancer and, hence, appropriate candidates for less aggressive treatments. Recently we established risk indices and published the corresponding absolute risk estimates for type of recurrence. However, two features of the study design, namely the presence of competing risks and the use of a stratified case-cohort design, constrained us to using crude empirical methods for analysis and left us unable to validate the clinical utility of our models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a unified, principled statistical framework for building, selecting, and evaluating clinically relevant risk indices, permitting refinement and validation of existing risk prediction models in our DCIS study as well as beyond.  We face multiple challenges including how to objectively build risk indices with relevant variables; how to estimate the corresponding risks (competing or not) in various subsample study designs; and, how to validate the resulting risk prediction models. Recently, we developed partDSA, a tree-based method which affords tremendous flexibility in building predictive models and provides an ideal foundation for developing a clinician- friendly tool for accurate stratification and risk prediction. In its curret form, partDSA is unable to estimate absolute risk in the presence of competing risks accounting for subsample study designs. Here we extend partDSA for such clinically relevant scenarios (Aim 1). We also propose aggregate learning for risk prediction to increase prediction accuracy and subsequently to build more stable but easily interpretable risk models (Aim 2). Finally, we propose the necessary methods for validating the resulting models (Aim 3).  Our proposal has two immediate public health benefits: first, these novel statistical methods will result in a clinician-friendly, publicly available tool for accurate risk prediction, stratification and validaion in numerous clinical settings; second, current DCIS risk models will be refined and validated with the expectation of better delineating those at low risk, hence strong candidates for conservative treatments including active surveillance.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.              Our proposal has two public health components: first, our novel statistical methods will provide a clinician- friendly, publicly available tool for accurate isk prediction, stratification and validation in numerous clinical settings; second, current ductal carcinoma in situ risk models will be refined and validated, helping facilitate the decision-making process faced by patients and their clinicians.            ",Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction,8373032,R01CA163687,"['Accounting', 'Anxiety', 'Breast', 'Carcinoma', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Benefit', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Mastectomy', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Screening for cancer', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'breast lumpectomy', 'cancer risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'loss of function', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'simulation', 'tool']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2012,335601,0.011952934864177322
"Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since receiving the K24 award, I have established a successful clinical research and training program in patient-oriented research (POR) in rheumatic disease with a focus on genetic, biomarker, and environmental risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). I continue to have independent grant support, and have mentored 15 new clinical investigators who have published 25 peer- reviewed papers during the K24 period. Three mentees have received NIH K awards and one has received an NIH R01. With renewal of the K24, I would continue to have protected time to devote to this program that has a unique training environment and an array of important POR projects. Genetic and environmental epidemiology studies have produced convincing evidence for multiple alleles and exposures as RA risk factors. A strong gene-environment (GXE) interaction between HLA-DRB1 alleles and smoking has been demonstrated for risk of the immune phenotype of CCP positive RA but not CCP negative RA. As CCP antibodies occur years before RA onset, I hypothesize that this interaction induces anti-citrulline immunity, a critical step in RA pathogenesis. These findings emphasize the need to study genes, environment and immunity with careful phenotyping. Family history encompasses unmeasured genetic and environmental risk, yet is not measured accurately in other studies including those in my research portfolio. Specific aims are to: 1) Maintain and expand my clinical research training program by mentoring new clinical investigators in POR in rheumatic diseases; 2) Enrich my comprehensive POR program to study family history, genetic, and environmental predictors in the etiology of RA using a new collection of RA cases and controls from Partners HealthCare; 2a) Collect family history data and environmental exposure data concerning smoking and reproductive factors on 1,500 RA patients and 4,500 age- and gender-matched controls by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) queries of electronic medical records; 2b: Examine genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors and GXE in predicting immune phenotypes of RA: RA with and without CCP antibodies (CCP?), and RA with and without rheumatoid factor antibodies (RF?); and 2c: Apply this comprehensive risk model to RA cases and controls and to subsets of RA stratified by specific immune phenotypes and stratified by family history of RA and other autoimmune diseases. The proposed study will leverage the NIH funded Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside study that used an advanced informatics infrastructure to extract clinical data on RA diagnostic features through database mining and NLP. A highly specific algorithm was used to identify RA cases and collect samples from cases and controls. The NLP techniques will be used to extract risk factor data from clinical notes. This proposal builds on my strong track record of POR, extending the work to add family history from a new case-control collection, validate data by patient interview, and develop predictive models for risk of RA that can be used to select high risk individuals for future RA prevention trials. Project Narrative  Innovative predictive modeling incorporating family history, genes, environmental exposures, and gene-  environment interactions, is a key step in the progress towards an RA prevention clinical trial.","Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk",8288292,K24AR052403,"['ARHGEF5 gene', 'Address', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Calibration', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cigarette', 'Citrulline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Markers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'HLA-DR4 Antigen', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Human Genome', 'ICD-9', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunologist', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Measures', 'Menopausal Status', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methotrexate', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Minerals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Notification', 'Occupational', 'PTPN22 gene', 'Paper', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'STAT4 gene', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Sushi Domain', 'Sweden', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'TNF receptor-associated factor 1', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'adalimumab', 'base', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'cytokine', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic technology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'infliximab', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'parity', 'patient oriented research', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prevention clinical trial', 'programs', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'toxin metabolism', 'trafficking', 'treatment response', 'tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2012,157939,-0.006435913640177353
"Exploring the Feasibility of Approximate Sequential Pattern Discovery in Massive    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to predict the clinical course of intensive care unit (ICU) patients in a timely manner can guide decision making and accelerate research into therapeutic efforts and the economics of care. To achieve this, a variety of ICU-based risk scoring systems have been proposed to risk stratify patients using ""snapshots"" of variables at specific points in time. These systems are not designed to provide a continuous assessment of patient status in real-time. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in intelligent patient monitoring (IPM) systems that can use information in continuously recorded ICU signals to recognize changes suggestive of dangerous pathophysiologieis. The aim of our research is to augment the knowledge base for these IPM systems by exploring the feasibility of pattern discovery methods to identify novel markers of future risk from large volumes of continuous ICU data. We focus, in particular, on sophisticated methods from data mining and machine learning that are computationally efficient, robust, and able to identify multi-parameter time-series trends useful for risk stratification. To facilitate these efforts, we will utilize the high volume acuity environment of the Surgical ICU (SICU) at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. We will study the use of pattern discovery methods to identify high and low risk patterns in historical data from over 5,000 patients admitted to the SICU, and then prospectively evaluate our findings on real-time SICU data at the Henry Ford from over 3,700 patients. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to develop novel decision support tools based on high and low risk patterns discovered from large historical time-series ICU datasets. Using fully-automated and computationally efficient algorithms, we will first identify characteristic units of temporal activity that explain the multi-parameter physiological time-series for ICU patients, and then discover approximate sequences of these characteristic units associated with adverse events in patients with known outcomes. The patterns discovered using our approach will be integrated into real-time decision support tools to signal alerts when high risk patterns are observed; and (2) to prospectively validate decision support tools based on high and low risk patterns in ICU time-series on real-time ICU data. We will conduct a pilot study validating these tools by studying the association between the predictions for these tools and actual adverse outcomes observed in the SICU. Each tool will be evaluated based on the following metrics: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and clinical time-frame of prediction. We will further compare the improvement provided by these tools to existing risk scoring systems.           Project Narrative Successful management of critical care patients depends on the ability of clinicians to estimate the risk of future adverse events, and ideally, to anticipate and prevent those events. We propose to explore low-cost, and widely applicable methods that would improve the ability of physicians to identify patients at high risk for adverse events in real time in ICU settings. The key concept for this proposal is that time-series data collected in the ICU contain valuable prognostic information that can be extracted using novel, sophisticated techniques drawn from the domains of machine learning and data mining. This information can be used to develop real- time clinical tools to improve management of critically ill patients.",Exploring the Feasibility of Approximate Sequential Pattern Discovery in Massive,8191345,R21LM010954,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Admission', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Intensive Care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2011,168115,0.004116502312428803
"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials.

With renewal of the K24, I would continue to have protected time to devote to this program that has a unique training environment and an array of important POR projects. Genetic and environmental epidemiology studies have produced convincing evidence for multiple alleles and exposures as RA risk factors. A strong gene-environment (GXE) interaction between HLA-DRB1 alleles and smoking has been demonstrated for risk of the immune phenotype of CCP positive RA but not CCP negative RA. As CCP antibodies occur years before RA onset, I hypothesize that this interaction induces anti-citrulline immunity, a critical step in RA pathogenesis. These findings emphasize the need to study genes, environment and immunity with careful phenotyping. Family history encompasses unmeasured genetic and environmental risk, yet is not measured accurately in other studies including those in my research portfolio. Specific aims are to: 1) Maintain and expand my clinical research training program by mentoring new clinical investigators in POR in rheumatic diseases; 2) Enrich my comprehensive POR program to study family history, genetic, and environmental predictors in the etiology of RA using a new collection of RA cases and controls from Partners HealthCare; 2a) Collect family history data and environmental exposure data concerning smoking and reproductive factors on 1,500 RA patients and 4,500 age- and gender-matched controls by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) queries of electronic medical records; 2b: Examine genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors and GXE in predicting immune phenotypes of RA: RA with and without CCP antibodies (CCP?), and RA with and without rheumatoid factor antibodies (RF?); and 2c: Apply this comprehensive risk model to RA cases and controls and to subsets of RA stratified by specific immune phenotypes and stratified by family history of RA and other autoimmune diseases. The proposed study will leverage the NIH funded Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside study that used an advanced informatics infrastructure to extract clinical data on RA diagnostic features through database mining and NLP. A highly specific algorithm was used to identify RA cases and collect samples from cases and controls. The NLP techniques will be used to extract risk factor data from clinical notes. This proposal builds on my strong track record of POR, extending the work to add family history from a new case-control collection, validate data by patient interview, and develop predictive models for risk of RA that can be used to select high risk individuals for future RA prevention trials.             Project Narrative  Innovative predictive modeling incorporating family history, genes, environmental exposures, and gene-  environment interactions, is a key step in the progress towards an RA prevention clinical trial.","Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk",8078134,K24AR052403,"['ARHGEF5 gene', 'Address', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Calibration', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cigarette', 'Citrulline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Markers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'HLA-DR4 Antigen', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Human Genome', 'ICD-9', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunologist', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Measures', 'Menopausal Status', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methotrexate', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Minerals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Notification', 'Occupational', 'PTPN22 gene', 'Paper', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'STAT4 gene', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Sushi Domain', 'Sweden', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'TNF receptor-associated factor 1', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'adalimumab', 'base', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'cytokine', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic technology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'infliximab', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'parity', 'patient oriented research', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prevention clinical trial', 'programs', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'toxin metabolism', 'trafficking', 'treatment response', 'tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2011,157939,-0.006435913640177353
"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials.

"Clinical Validation of BCT - Phase II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fracture risk assessment is integral to the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, a devastating clinical condition of which over 40 million Americans are at risk. Due to limitations in areal BMD measures obtained from 2D DXA scans - the current clinical standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis - it has recently become clear that those at risk of osteoporotic fracture need to be better identified. A 3D biomechanics-based technique, which we term Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT), addresses this need through a combination of engineering finite element analysis, 3D quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and bone fracture biomechanics. The main outcome parameter of BCT is an estimate of the biomechanical risk of a bone fracture that accounts for such factors as the patient's 3D bone geometry and distribution of bone density, body-weight, height, trochanteric soft tissue thickness (for hip fractures), muscle moment arm (for spine), and the age-related risk of sustaining an overload event (such as a fall or lifting of a heavy object with back bent). In the larger context of translating BCT to clinical practice, we seek in this Phase II SBIR project to test the overall hypothesis that BCT is a better predictor of osteoporotic fracture than is areal BMD, for both hip and spine fracture and for both women and men. In Phase I of this project, we successfully applied this technique to explain observed age-related trends in hip fracture rates. For Phase II, we plan in our first Aim to refine our BCT technique to produce a fully automated, highly reliable and highly accurate software suite with the capability to analyze CT scans acquired for any medical test with coverage of the hip and/or spine without an external calibration phantom. For Aim 2, in order to ensure optimal prediction of clinical fractures, we will further refine our overall BCT process by calibrating results from the two cohorts (the Mayo Clinic cohort of 750 men and women in Rochester MN, and the MrOS cohort of 3,500 men in six U.S. locations). Issues to be resolved in this calibration process include determining optimal methods for measuring soft tissue thickness, muscle moment arms, and spine loading. This analysis will also enable us to calibrate our function for age- related risk of sustaining an overload event, which may depend on both fracture type (hip vs. spine) and sex. In Aim 3, we will compile normative data for BCT outcomes, critical information for interpretation of clinical results. Having refined and calibrated the overall BCT technique and identified the most successful BCT predictors of clinical fracture in the Mayo and MrOS cohorts, we will proceed in Aim 4 to test the validity of these predictors in a fully prospective manner, without any further modification of the BCT technique. For this, we will analyze the AGES cohort of 5,500 women and men in Reykjavik, Iceland, for incident hip and spine fracture. Taken together, this multi-cohort international validation study will provide new insight into osteoporotic fracture etiology, important advancements for the BCT method, and a thorough evaluation of BCT clinical performance. This project should therefore have a significant impact on osteoporosis research and clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis.

"Integrated Cardio-Renal Risk Prediction Models in Type 1 Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application addresses broad Challenge Area (03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation, and the specific Challenge Topic that this application addresses is: 03-DK-101 Discovery of biomarkers for disease risk, progression or response to therapy in diseases of interest to NIDDK. The Challenge: Despite tremendous progress in treatment, patients with type 1 diabetes continue to die 15 years earlier, experience excess morbidity and have medical costs over 10 times higher than the general population. The risk of coronary artery disease and diabetic nephropathy is still greatly increased and responsible for 80% of deaths in these patients. Diabetic nephropathy and coronary artery disease are intertwined, suggesting common pathways, and yet current risk prediction is inadequate. Study Rationale: Nearly 25% of T1D patients develop end-stage renal disease. The conventional theory is that the sequence of events leading to diabetic nephropathy begins from microalbuminuria, progressing to overt proteinuria and eventual end-stage renal disease. Primary prevention with ACE/ARB treatment usually begins when persistent microalbuminuria is found. However, recent prospective studies using serial measurements of kidney function estimated from serum cystatin C have changed this paradigm by demonstrating that decline in glomerular filtration may begin in the absence of microalbuminuria or continue despite remission of microalbuminuria. By their mid 40's, over 70% of men and 50% of women with type 1 diabetes develop coronary artery calcification (CAC) - a marker of significant atherosclerotic plaque burden. Cardiovascular disease is particularly prevalent among patients with renal disease, but most cardiac events occur in patients with normal albumin excretion rates. Evidence has accumulated that diabetic nephropathy and CAC are parallel, rather than sequential, complications of type 1 diabetes, sharing a number of important predictors. Accurate prediction of the individual's global cardio-renal risk is needed to guide treatment choices. As a result, there is a recognized need for better risk partitioning, either from the discovery of additional biomarkers or the application of superior methods for discrimination of disease states. Our Approach: We are proposing to use the biobank of 652 adults with type 1 diabetes who have been thoroughly genotyped and prospectively followed for development of diabetic nephropathy and coronary artery disease by the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes study (CACTI, R01 HL61753, 1999- 2009) to develop and validate integrated biomarker prediction models for cardio-renal complications in type 1 diabetes. Our study aims are the investigation of biomarkers within the well-characterized CACTI cohort for 1) early progressive renal function decline, 2) the presence and progression of coronary artery calcium, and the 3) development of combined renal and cardiovascular disease burden. Renal disease and coronary artery disease (CAD) are the leading causes of death among adults with type 1 diabetes, but traditional screening tests (urinary albumin and serum creatinine) for renal disease are inadequate, and traditional CAD risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity) do not fully explain the increased burden of disease associated with type 1 diabetes. Renal and cardiovascular complications are intertwined, suggesting shared pathways. Increased systemic inflammation is present in type 1 diabetes and inflammatory mediators such as uric acid, vitamin D and bone metabolism markers have been suggested to play a role in both renal and cardiovascular diseases. As a result, it is of critical public health importance to discover and validate new biomarkers for cardio-renal disease among adults with type 1 diabetes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Renal disease and coronary artery disease (CAD) are the leading causes of death among adults with type 1 diabetes, but traditional screening tests (urinary albumin and serum creatinine) for renal disease are inadequate, and traditional CAD risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity) do not fully explain the increased burden of disease associated with type 1 diabetes.

"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials.

"Clinical Validation of BCT - Phase II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fracture risk assessment is integral to the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, a devastating clinical condition of which over 40 million Americans are at risk. Due to limitations in areal BMD measures obtained from 2D DXA scans - the current clinical standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis - it has recently become clear that those at risk of osteoporotic fracture need to be better identified. A 3D biomechanics-based technique, which we term Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT), addresses this need through a combination of engineering finite element analysis, 3D quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and bone fracture biomechanics. The main outcome parameter of BCT is an estimate of the biomechanical risk of a bone fracture that accounts for such factors as the patient's 3D bone geometry and distribution of bone density, body-weight, height, trochanteric soft tissue thickness (for hip fractures), muscle moment arm (for spine), and the age-related risk of sustaining an overload event (such as a fall or lifting of a heavy object with back bent). In the larger context of translating BCT to clinical practice, we seek in this Phase II SBIR project to test the overall hypothesis that BCT is a better predictor of osteoporotic fracture than is areal BMD, for both hip and spine fracture and for both women and men. In Phase I of this project, we successfully applied this technique to explain observed age-related trends in hip fracture rates. For Phase II, we plan in our first Aim to refine our BCT technique to produce a fully automated, highly reliable and highly accurate software suite with the capability to analyze CT scans acquired for any medical test with coverage of the hip and/or spine without an external calibration phantom. For Aim 2, in order to ensure optimal prediction of clinical fractures, we will further refine our overall BCT process by calibrating results from the two cohorts (the Mayo Clinic cohort of 750 men and women in Rochester MN, and the MrOS cohort of 3,500 men in six U.S. locations). Issues to be resolved in this calibration process include determining optimal methods for measuring soft tissue thickness, muscle moment arms, and spine loading. This analysis will also enable us to calibrate our function for age- related risk of sustaining an overload event, which may depend on both fracture type (hip vs. spine) and sex. In Aim 3, we will compile normative data for BCT outcomes, critical information for interpretation of clinical results. Having refined and calibrated the overall BCT technique and identified the most successful BCT predictors of clinical fracture in the Mayo and MrOS cohorts, we will proceed in Aim 4 to test the validity of these predictors in a fully prospective manner, without any further modification of the BCT technique. For this, we will analyze the AGES cohort of 5,500 women and men in Reykjavik, Iceland, for incident hip and spine fracture. Taken together, this multi-cohort international validation study will provide new insight into osteoporotic fracture etiology, important advancements for the BCT method, and a thorough evaluation of BCT clinical performance. This project should therefore have a significant impact on osteoporosis research and clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Successful translation of BCT to clinical practice has the potential to greatly improve non-invasive assessment of fracture risk, which would represent an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.           Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis.

"Identifying Receipt of Colorectal Cancer Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Regular screening for CRC leads to early detection and a substantial reduction in CRC-related morbidity and mortality. Despite this evidence, adherence to CRC screening recommendations remains poor. Given the benefits of screening for CRC, interventions need to be developed that will ultimately increase its utilization. These interventions must be targeted towards individuals who have never been screened or are not current with their screening, and must take into account risk factors [e.g., family history, inflammatory bowel disease, history of previous adenomas]. A significant barrier to applying CRC screening interventions is the ability to accurately and quickly identify patients in need of screening. In our proposed project, we will create and evaluate an innovative electronic data collection system to enhance our understanding of the delivery and utilization of CRC screening. We will use as a test site the primary care clinics affiliated with Vanderbilt University Medical Center, but the approach developed will be general enough to work wherever adequate electronic records are available. This data collection system will build upon our prior work using the Knowledge Map Concept Identifier (KMCI), which was originally developed to extract biomedical concepts represented in the medical school curriculum at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. We will build a tool using KMCI as its core to detect receipt of CRC screening and to provide its context (e.g., individual risk factors, which CRC test was performed, when, and the results). Utilizing information from the electronic records and billing (claims) records, this system will allow for rapid and accurate identification of which patients have and have not received CRC screening tests, and for identification of those patients that require follow-up after their screening tests. We will determine the test characteristics of KMCI (sensitivity, specificity) for identifying receipt of CRC screening, and compare this to an automated review of billing records. We hypothesize that KMCI will perform better than an automated review of billing records in detecting receipt of CRC screening, and will provide richer, contextual information regarding the screening tests.           n/a",Identifying Receipt of Colorectal Cancer Screening,7340158,R21CA116573,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electronics', 'Family history of', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Polyps', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening Result', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'billing data', 'cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'concept', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'novel', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,121564,-0.0034310900402043623

"HIV Risk Behavior in out-of school rural Af. Am. Young Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent epidemiological evidence indicates that the risk of contracting HIV is increasing among African American young adults living in the rural South. African American communities in rural Georgia are characterized by chronic unemployment and poverty along with a dearth of health and educational resources. Young adults in these communities face significant barriers to adequate employment and higher education. Many respond to this lack of opportunity and the resulting economic pressure by engaging in high-risk behavior, including substance use and unprotected sexual activity. Although young adults attending higher education have been studied extensively, barriers to obtaining valid samples have prevented empirical research on the risk and protective factors that affect rural African American young adults who do not attend college. The research proposed in this R-21 application addresses the public health need to develop new approaches to obtaining valid samples of hard-to-reach members of populations at risk for HIV and substance use and to identify the protective factors that dissuade them from engaging in high risk behaviors. The objectives of this study are to (1) test the feasibility of Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) for obtaining a sample of rural African American young adults age 18-21 who are out of school and living in resource- poor, rural environments, and (2) evaluate a model of the personal, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors that explain high-risk sexual behavior among these young people. RDS is a novel technique that combines ""snowball sampling"" with a mathematical model that weights the sample to compensate for its non-random nature. RDS will be used to obtain a sample of 240 rural African American young adults. Data will be gathered to evaluate a heuristic model that includes the following predictors: socioeconomic and personal stressors; the negative emotions these stressors induce; support and socialization from prosocial adults; intrapersonal protective processes, including a future orientation, self-regulation, emotion regulation, and racial identity; affiliations with risk-taking peers and sexual partners; and antecedents of HIV-related risk behavior, such as behavioral intentions and attitudes toward sexually protective behaviors.           n/a",HIV Risk Behavior in out-of school rural Af.

"Computerized population Programs for Three Cancer Risks   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims of this research project                            are (1) to replicate one of the most effective approaches to behavioral              intervention, a series of expert system interventions, for both smoking              cessation and reduction of dietary fat on a national sample; (2) to extend the       intervention to the reduction of sedentary life style; (3) to develop and            assess the effectiveness of an innovative automated counseling intervention,         the TLC telecommunications system, applied to the same 3 behavioral risk             factors; (4) to compare the effectiveness of the current modular expert system       approach with an integrated expert system intervention, and (5) to determine         the cost-effectiveness of each of the 3 interventions. All subjects will be at       risk for all 3 risk factors and all interventions would intervene on all 3 risk      factors simultaneously. The modular expert system intervention involves 3            assessments, each followed by 3 separate feedback reports at 6-month intervals       for each of the risk factors. The telecommunications system involves briefer         assessments on each risk factor and counseling luring regular telephone              contacts over a 12-month period. The integrated expert system intervention           involves a single assessment on 3 occasions of all 3 risk factors followed by        intervention on all 3 risk factors simultaneously in an attempt to increase          efficiency and capitalize on the covariance between the behaviors. All 3             interventions are based on the Transtheoretical Model. The national sample           would be 1600 subjects recruited throughout the continental United States using      random digit dial telephone methodology. All interventions are designed to           impact on a total population and a proactive recruitment procedure will be           employed to recruit more than 75 percent of the eligible sample. The design is       a 4-group (Control, Modular Expert System intervention, Telecommunications           Intervention, Integrated Expert System Intervention) x 3 occasions (0, 12, and       24 months).

The goal of this project is to determine how individual risk perceptions             influence health behaviors among the near-elderly (51-61) and decisions              regarding wealth holdings among the elderly (70+). Among the near-elderly, the       following health behaviors will be studied: the use of preventive services           (mammography, prostate screening, and cholesterol screening), weight loss and        exercise. The preventive services are designed to reduce mortality from cancer       and heart disease. Weight loss and exercise are both preventive measures as          well as mitigators of harm that results from health shocks. Expanding the use        of these preventive and mitigating measures are important to reduce morbidity        and mortality from heart disease and cancer. Among the elderly, the behavior of      interest relates to asset accumulation/dissaving, specifically focusing on           housing decisions. The specific decisions will be selling a house, and changes       in housing wealth holdings. The two decisions will be analyzed because housing       assets likely have fewer measurement errors, and because housing is the major        component of wealth for most elderly persons. Housing decisions are important        from a policy perspective because they may represent precautionary savings to        finance long-term care, a substantial risk the elderly face.                                                                                                              The proposed conceptual model is an extension of the common Bayesian learning        model whereby prior risk perceptions are updated on the basis of information.

"Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning Project Abstract Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals. Currently there are no proven effective therapies for treatment of advanced non-neovascular AMD, termed geographic atrophy (GA). Earlier intervention may be preferable, but this would require identification of those individuals with the highest risk for progression to atrophy. Over the last two decades, various studies including ours have identified several optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based factors that appear to associate with a higher risk for AMD progression. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important risk factors, yielding a better prediction of AMD progression risk than current subjectively specified features. In this proposal, we will first develop an AI- based system to automatically identify the “subjectively-specified” high risk factors based on individual spectral domain (SD) OCT 2D scans, and to automatically segment GA (the end-stage outcome variable of AMD) in OCT 2D en face maps. Subsequently, as a proof-of-concept study of our hypothesis, we will apply an AI-based “reverse learning” approach to objectively learn and identify AMD high risk factors in longitudinal OCT data. To achieve these objectives, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate an AI approach to classify individual OCT 2D scans as containing or not containing the pre-specified risk factor(s). In our previous work, we manually identified the presence or absence of the pre-specific high-risk factors and assigned to a risk score based on the entire OCT volume. Such approach was time consuming and not precise. In this proposal, an AI algorithm will be applied to detect the high risk factors from individual OCT scans. Hence, the precision of the scoring system can be greatly enhanced with high computational complexity. Aim 2: Develop and validate an AI approach to segment GA lesions from 2D OCT en face maps. For the OCT volumes having atrophy, we will perform the GA segmentation from the choroidal hypertransmission-resulted en face map using the multi-scale CNNs. Aim 3: Develop and validate an AI “reverse learning” approach to objectively identify the high risk factors using longitudinal OCT data. The “reverse learning” will be based on the multiple CNNs, followed by de- convolutional networks to identify the high risk factors objectively. Our previous scoring system will possibly be refined and optimized by the potential inclusion (or substitution) of novel risk factors derived from our objective AI approaches. The work in this proposal will be performed retrospectively in SD-OCT images from the image data pool that the multi-PI Sadda has aggregated over years as the director of the Doheny image reading center. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals and it may be preferable to intervene at an earlier stage in the disease process. We propose to use artificial intelligence techniques to automatically and objectively identify and quantify end-stage atrophy as well to identify the features on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), which are associated with a higher risk for progression to late atrophic AMD. This research should have implications for clinical practice in the staging and monitoring of AMD patients, as well as facilitating new therapeutic trials for AMD.",Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning,9986814,R21EY030619,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Back', 'Blindness', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drusen', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Elderly', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'geographic atrophy', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'progression marker', 'research study']",NEI,DOHENY EYE INSTITUTE,R21,2020,196250,0.042680392127380076
"SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in technology, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare costs in the U.S. Yet, there is a tremendous gap in accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in CVD risks and outcomes for disaggregated Hispanic and Asian subgroups. The current cardiovascular risk assessment tools have not been well-validated in these diverse populations, and it remains largely unknown why minority patients are less likely to start and more likely to stop life-saving therapies. The overall goal of Dr. Rodriguez’s K01 application is to address gaps in knowledge about CVD prediction and treatment in understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. The proposed study will utilize the electronic health record (EHR) data from an established NHLBI-funded cohort enriched with disaggregated Hispanic and Asian patients. Using this cohort, Dr. Rodriguez will first test the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups using a large diverse mixed-payer cohort of 1,234,751 patients from two large healthcare systems in Northern California and Hawaii. Secondly, she will build new CVD risk prediction models for diverse patient subgroups using machine learning techniques. Finally, she will identify reasons for statin underuse and discontinuation using natural language processing in the EHR. This study, which will evaluate existing data from real-world clinical practice in a stable population, will inform future risk prediction models and cholesterol treatment guidelines for diverse racial/ethnic groups. The proposal is aligned with the NHBLI’s strategic goals to eliminate health disparities and inequities by leveraging epidemiology and data science to understand and solve complex health problems. This proposal will also prepare Dr. Rodriguez to meet her long-term goal of becoming a national leader and independent investigator in CVD prevention and minority health. The proposed didactic and applied data science experiences, including training in advanced epidemiological methods and machine learning, will prepare Dr. Rodriguez to apply her research to other areas of CVD prevention and populations. This training program builds on the strengths of Stanford University in health services research, epidemiology, and biomedical informatics. Her mentorship team, led by Dr. Latha Palaniappan, includes experts in cardiovascular prevention and health services research (Dr. Heidenreich, co-mentor), applied statistical analyses (Dr. Robert Tibshirani, advisor), machine learning in the EHR (Dr. Nigam Shah, advisor), and chronic disease prediction and medical decision making (Dr. Michael Pignone, advisor). Dr. Rodriguez’s team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal as well as overseeing her advanced training in their respective areas of expertise. The research and training plan proposed in this K01 application will develop Dr. Rodriguez into a unique and highly-skilled clinician researcher ready to compete for R-level funding and launch her independent research career. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S., yet current CVD risk prediction algorithms fail to adequately assess risk in these populations. The proposal will address this substantial knowledge gap by validating current risk prediction models in racial/ethnic minority subgroups, improving risk prediction using modern machine learning techniques, and identifying reasons for statin discontinuation. Findings from this study will provide the foundation for clinical guidelines, research agendas, and public health interventions to improve CVD prevention strategies in diverse populations. !",SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups),9851429,K01HL144607,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mexican Americans', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Puerto Rican', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'South Asian', 'Stable Populations', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'college', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'epidemiologic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health difference', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevention service', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'random forest', 'risk prediction model', 'side effect', 'skills', 'structured data', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support vector machine', 'treatment guidelines', 'unstructured data']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,172001,0.029993431955444825
"Machine Learning to Reduce Hypertension Treatment Clinical Inertia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) is a main risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It can be managed through use of antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modification (i.e., diet and exercise). Adults who have controlled BP have close to a 50% decreased risk of CVD-related mortality compared to those with uncontrolled BP. However, using current guidelines, over 40% of the 100 million US adults with HTN have controlled BP. Thus, uncontrolled BP remains a significant and largely unchecked public health issue in the United States. Interventions to improve BP control exist (i.e., medication adherence and diet and exercise), but they are mostly complex and resource intensive. If resources to improve HTN control are to be efficiently used, identifying patients who are likely to have persistently uncontrolled BP may provide an opportunity for targeted and tailored intervention and close monitoring. Application of a machine learning algorithm (MLA) to electronic medical record (EMR) data could identify patients likely to have uncontrolled BP. The use and amount of data in EMRs continues to expand and improve in quality. The Temple Health EMR contains extensive demographic, clinical, prescribing, and dispensing data. MLAs are ideally suited to harness this complex and abundant data. MLAs recognize patterns in data that may be difficult to detect by researchers and identify variables that are important for prediction of an outcome. They have been used to predict hospital length of stay, hospital mortality rates, and even detect diabetic retinopathy. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest MLA to predict risk of uncontrolled BP among adults with HTN. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled BP into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients. Third, Compare clinical management of hypertension with and without a prototype of an MLA-CDS tool through a case-vignette study. These aims align with my career goal of lowering CVD risk in adults. I will accomplish these aims with the help of an accomplished mentoring team focused on hypertension and antihypertensive medication adherence, machine learning, and qualitative interviewing and CDS-tool development. During the timeframe of this study I will gain experience in (1) MLA development and validation, (2) qualitative interviewing skills to develop CDS tools for clinicians, and (3) leadership skills for principal investigators. These skills will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on identifying people at high risk for chronic disease related to CVD events and developing tools to assist physicians in lowering CVD risk at the population level. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest machine learning algorithm (MLA) to predict risk of uncontrolled blood pressure among adults with hypertension. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled blood pressure into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients.

"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this ﬁeld typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind admis- sion risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modiﬁable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital ad- missions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classiﬁcation models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to signiﬁcantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close men- toring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a support- ive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identiﬁcation and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,9906933,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical center', 'clinical encounter', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'social', 'statistical learning', 'structured data', 'supportive environment', 'trend', 'trial design', 'unstructured data']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2020,194806,0.010059440125632745
"Using Machine Learning to Improve Readmission Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Project Summary/Abstract By 2060, approximately 14 million adults are expected to live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). Although ADRD patients represent 10% of the general geriatric population, they account for 37% of the direct healthcare expenditures. Compared to other older adults, ADRD patients are at a significantly higher risk of hospitalization and unplanned 30-day hospital readmission (hereafter “readmission”). Readmissions are costly and expose ADRD patients to expedited cognitive decline, premature institutionalization, and death. Availability of a caregiver after hospital discharge is critical for ADRD patients to ensure adherence to diet, medications, and follow-up appointments. There is a paucity of evidence examining readmission among the ADRD population. Most risk-assessment tools (e.g. LACE Index) have poor discrimination power and lack inclusion of influential medical and social features, and caregiver availability particular to ADRD patients. A potential solution is to develop a risk tool using hospitals’ electronic health records (EHRs) because they contain salient clinical and sociodemographic features as well as a wealth of information from physicians’, nurses’ and social workers’ notes (unstructured EHRs data). The specific research aims for this proposal are to (1) develop and validate a risk-assessment tool for predicting readmission among ADRD patients; (2) examine the feasibility/acceptability and clinical/economic utility of the readmission risk- assessment tool; and (3) develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to extract information on caregiver availability from unstructured EHRs (exploratory). We hypothesize that the predictive power of our risk tool will be at least 20% higher than that of LACE Index (the current risk tool used in the Michigan Medicine hospitals). To accomplish this project, my mentors and I have defined a set of targeted career goals and educational training. My training aims include (1) gain familiarity with the clinical aspects of ADRD (linked with Research Aim 1); (2) acquire methodological skills in machine learning and predictive modeling (linked with Research Aim 1); (3) develop an understanding of the logistics of the ADRD patient discharge and care transition processes (linked with Research Aim 2); and (4) gain proficiency in NLP and algorithm validation (linked with Research Aim 3). By completion of this award, I will have used EHRs and data science to develop a validated risk-assessment tool for readmission for hospitalized ADRD patients. The results will enable efficient and targeted discharge planning to reduce readmission and wasteful spending. It will also provide pilot data needed to apply for an R01 examining the optimization of discharge process/location for hospitalized ADRD patients. This career development award will lay the foundation for me to become a unique health economist specialized in efficient care transitions for ADRD patients. Narrative Patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) are at higher risk of hospitalization and 30-day readmission (readmission) compared to other older adults. Readmission is expensive and increases the risk of institutionalization and premature death among ADRD patients.

"Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning Project Summary Dr. Pappas is a junior faculty member in the Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, with appointments in the Center for Value-Based Care Research and the Department of Hospital Medicine (Cleveland, OH). This career development award aims to provide training in propensity methods, deep learning techniques, and pilot intervention development, ultimately seeking to identify personalized approaches to cardiac stress testing before surgery. Noncardiac surgery carries risk of mortality and morbidity, and cardiac complications account for the largest share of perioperative mortality. Meanwhile, current approaches are expensive and may not effectively reduce cardiac risk. This proposal uses machine learning techniques to define the value of information provided by each different kind of stress test and the expected benefit of different therapeutic interventions through which preoperative risks might be modified. It then seeks to identify the most helpful cardiac stress test, if any. In this career development award, Dr. Pappas proposes three phases of investigation, and in so doing will acquire new skills critical to achieving his goal of becoming an expert in perioperative risk mitigation. In Aim 1, Dr. Pappas will use propensity matching techniques to evaluate prior associations between preoperative stress testing and improved postoperative mortality, when including rich clinical data not available to previous large studies. In Aim 2, he will use machine learning techniques to estimate the value of information provided by each modality of stress testing, and the impact on the risk of each event from each intervention. In Aim 3, Dr. Pappas will pilot an intervention presenting personalized estimates to physicians in the preoperative clinic. In addition to advanced training through formal coursework, this career development award is supported by an extraordinary mentorship team, including internationally-recognized experts in perioperative outcomes research, cardiovascular disease, use of observational healthcare data, and machine learning. The combination of formal training and mentored research outlined in this application is designed to ensure that Dr. Pappas will emerge from this award as an independent investigator and expert in personalized perioperative decision-making. Project Narrative Many patients die soon after surgery, and many of those deaths are from heart problems. Physicians have tried to reduce those risks in many ways, but our current approach is expensive, leads to unhelpful testing, and probably doesn't do a very good job reducing the risk of death. This proposal uses a form of machine learning and a large dataset to try to find more personalized, more helpful, and less expensive strategies to try to reduce the risks of surgery, and then tests whether we can present personalized estimates to doctors that they could use when thinking about the risks of surgery.",Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning,9849333,K08HL141598,"['Appointment', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hospital Departments', 'Information Theory', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative complication', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Stress Tests', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'functional status', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'large datasets', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'perioperative mortality', 'personalized approach', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic value', 'randomized trial', 'risk mitigation', 'skills', 'surgical risk', 'therapy development', 'treatment center']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K08,2020,161047,0.01808326612128119
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies.

"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network PROJECT SUMMARY  Individuals with substance use disorders are disproportionately experiencing homelessness, poverty, and chronic medical conditions (diabetes and hypertension), which are emerging risk factors for contracting SARS-CoV-2 (official name for the virus that causes COVID-19). Different types of substance use have been associated with development of respiratory infections and progression to severe respiratory failure, also known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). However, complex syndromes like ARDS and behavioral conditions like substance misuse are difficult to identify from the electronic health record. Clinical notes and radiology reports provide a rich source of information that may be used to identify cases of substance misuse and ARDS. This information is routinely recorded during hospital care, and automated, data-driven solutions with natural language processing (NLP) can extract semantics and important risk factors from the unstructured data of clinical notes. The computational methods of NLP derive meaning from clinical notes, from which machine learning can predict risk factors for patients leaving AMA or progressing to respiratory failure. Our team developed tools with >80% sensitivity/specificity to identify individual types of substance misuse using NLP with machine learning (ML). Our single-center models delineated risk factors embedded in the notes (e.g., mental health conditions, socioeconomic indicators). Further, we have developed and externally validated a machine learning tool to identify cases of ARDS with high accuracy for early treatment. We aim to expand this work by pooling data across health systems and build a generalizable and comprehensive classifier that captures multiple types of substance misuse for use in risk stratification and prognostication during the COVID pandemic.  We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal analysis of hospitalized patients, and that such information can be used to identify those at risk for disrupted care and those at risk for respiratory failure. We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over 60,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. This Administrative Supplement will allow us to examine the correlations between substances of misuse and risk for COVID-19 as well as development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in the context of these phenomena. PROJECT NARRATIVE We anticipate that the research proposed will provide novel and critically important tools in artificial intelligence for the detection of substance misuse and COVID-19 from the electronic health record (EHR). Development and validation of a digital classifier would enable a standardized approach to perform screening on all patient encounters on a daily basis in health systems. We will rigorously develop and test the classifier retrospectively on an existing dataset of 60,000 patients. This will serve as the first step towards a comprehensive universal screener that leverages available data in the EHR.",Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network,10173503,UG1DA049467,"['2019-nCoV', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disasters', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Felis catus', 'General Population', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Home environment', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hurricane', 'Hypertension', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poverty', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social support', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Sterility', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'behavioral health', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'digital', 'drug market', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interoperability', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'mortality risk', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'overdose death', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'screening', 'social', 'social exclusion', 'social stigma', 'socioeconomics', 'substance misuse', 'success', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'unstructured data']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UG1,2020,139752,0.012634742018511438
"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows. We aim to develop a quantitative risk model for oral cavity cancer patients, 25-37% of whom will experience debilitating post-treatment recurrence. Using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we will develop and validate our risk model on a large multi-site cohort of patients, and develop an AI-assisted synoptic report-filling tool for integrating into clinical practice. A computational pathology approach to characterizing disease will help identify patients for whom aggressive multimodality therapy will improve outcomes and post-treatment quality of life.",A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort,9974099,R01DE028741,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Head and neck structure', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Economics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral Stage', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Productivity', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'analysis pipeline', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'international center', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'quality assurance', 'quantitative imaging', 'screening', 'segmentation algorithm', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NIDCR,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2020,382900,-0.009444982215229757
"Development of End-To-End Clinical Decision Support Tools To Prevent Cardiotoxic Drug Response SUMMARY Drug-induced cardiac toxicity, in the form of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, is an uncommon but devastating side effect of over one hundred currently marketed drugs. The ubiquity of drug-induced QT prolongation (diLQTS) across medical specialties and conditions creates a challenge for providers seeking to prescribe known QT-prolonging medications, particularly for non-cardiac conditions. Work by our group to develop automated clinical decision support (CDS) tools that alert providers of patient risk has shown promise towards reducing the number of prescriptions to at-risk individuals. However, these tools rely on a history of an electrocardiogram (ECG) with QT prolongation to identify at-risk patients, and thus exclude a large number of potentially at-risk individuals who have not had an ECG within our system. Through a unique institutional partnership with Google, in which a copy of our entire electronic health record (EHR) is stored on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), we have developed preliminary deep-learning models to predict risk of diLQTS. We have also validated the genetic association with the QT interval and diLQTS across several real-world populations using an aggregate polygenic risk score. Through creation of an institutional biobank with certification for clinical application of results, as well as cloud-based integration of EHR data with genetic data, we have the capability to leverage our existing infrastructure to study the role of deep learning and genetics to reduce the risk of diLQTS. This investigation will combine our unique research and clinical infrastructure on the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus with our investigative team composed of experts in the study of pharmacogenomics and medical informatics to develop and study an end-to-end CDS tool incorporating genetics and deep learning to predict risk of diLQTS. The specific aims of this application include the following: (1) develop and test a cloud-based, deep-learning model using EHR data on in- and outpatients to predict risk of diLQTS; (2) validate genetic predictors of diLQTS using institutional biobank samples, and a multi-ethnic external population; and (3) develop and test CDS tools using these advanced methods to reduce the risk of diLQTS. We will use a common data model (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) mapped from EHR data, as well as a custom DNA array (Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array) designed for imputation across a variety of non-European ancestries, to ensure that the our prediction model and findings from this study can be replicated in other institutions and populations in the future. In such a way, this investigation will not only provide insight into the use of machine learning and genetics for risk prediction of diLQTS, but it will also create a blueprint for future advanced CDS development for other conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is the development of a clinical decision support tool that can be used to predict the risk of drug-induced QT prolongation based on deep learning and genetics. This tool could be used to prevent potentially fatal side effects of medications when alternatives are available, or increase vigilance when safer alternatives are not available.

"Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with over 30,000 new HPV-related-cancers are diagnosed annually. Although HPV vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2006 and recommended for routine vaccination for school-age girls and boys, vaccination rates remain low. One reason that has contributed to low vaccination rates is incorrect “risk perceptions” around HPV vaccines such as the high perceived risks of adverse events or side effects from the HPV vaccine. Incorrect risk perceptions are often rooted in the false information about HPV vaccines that people are exposed to in their daily life, including social media. The impact of social media on health information is substantial. Negative social-media HPV-vaccine information has been found to have an association with low vaccination coverage. Given the negative consequences of false information, there is a need to develop a robust and scalable way to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it propagates and negatively impacts behavior. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to build a model to identify false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter, demonstrate its impact on individual risk perceptions and measure its underlying mechanisms on risk perception formation. We propose a novel approach to leverage machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, crowdsourcing/expert data annotation, psycholinguistic analysis and statistical modeling to investigate the false HPV-vaccine information collectively (in terms of its detection and propagation patterns) and individually (in terms of its impact and underlying cognitive mechanisms). Our study will first build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter. By modeling the domain-specific HPV- vaccine related text content, information-veracity related linguistic features, individual and collective user behaviors, and dissemination patterns, our model will be able to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it gets verified and spreads widely. We will then investigate the impact of false HPV-vaccine information on risk perceptions around HPV vaccination operationalized by natural language processing methods and a developed HPV-vaccine Risk Lexicon. We will further conduct psycholinguistic analysis on the false HPV-vaccine information and use statistical modeling to uncover the underlying mechanism of risk perceptions. Our study will make a critical and timely contribution to identifying the false HPV-vaccine information and its impact, which has the potential to be applied to other health topics. This proposed project will also address the National Cancer Institute priorities in promoting HPV vaccines and combating misinformation in cancer prevention and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE The uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in part because of incorrect perceptions of vaccination risks, which has been linked to the spread of false HPV-vaccine information. The proposed study seeks to build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on social media (Twitter) and determine its impact on risk perceptions of the HPV vaccine. The findings will provide important contributions to understand the impact of false health information on HPV vaccination behavior and could be expanded to other health topics.",Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions,9954963,R21CA237483,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Individual', 'Information Dissemination', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Politics', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'School-Age Population', 'Semantics', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Text', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'boys', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer prevention', 'combat', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'girls', 'high risk', 'information model', 'information processing', 'multilevel analysis', 'news', 'novel strategies', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'risk perception', 'side effect', 'social media', 'theories', 'uptake']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,211659,0.006173213972198326
"Robust AI to develop risk models in retinopathy of prematurity using deep learning ROP is a retinal neovascular disease affecting preterm infants, and is a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide. Known clinical risk factors include preterm birth, low birthweight and use of supplemental oxygen but improved risk models are needed to identify infants that progress to treatment requiring disease and blindness. Deep learning techniques have been used to successfully identify “plus” disease in multi- institutional cohorts and to provide a continuous measure of disease severity. A major limitation of deep learning, however, is the need for large amounts of well curated datasets. Other limitations include overfitting and “brittleness” that can cause model performance to drop on external data. There are, however, numerous barriers to building and hosting these large central repositories with multi-institutional data required for robust deep learning including concerns about data sharing, regulations costs, patient privacy and intellectual property. In this project, we aim to demonstrate the utility of distributed/federated deep learning approaches where the data are located within institutions, but model parameters are shared with a central server. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Specifically, we seek to build robust risk models for predicting treatment requiring disease. Two large cohorts will be used to validate the hypothesis that the performance of the risk models using distributed learning approaches that of centrally hosted and is more robust than models built on single institutional datasets.  Grants Admin Updated 04.01.2019 JBou Retinopathy of prematurity is a retinal neovascular disease affecting preterm infants and a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide.

"Machine learning approaches towards risk assessment and prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY The primary objectives of this project include understanding the interplay between molecular, genetic and clinical factors related to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), method development for accurate risk assessment of APOs well before they occur, and method development for collecting additional clinical data in routine treatment of at-risk-subjects. Towards these goals we have assembled a team of investigators with clinical, translational, and computational expertise capable of identifying novel contributors to APOs as well as facilitating clinician-patient interactions using data-driven and theoretically sound machine learning approaches. Our strategies will rely on advanced machine learning as well as integration of clinical, genetic, and molecular data and hold promise to bring precision medicine to the treatment and experience of women during and post pregnancy. We will predominantly rely on the data collected during the national “Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: monitoring mothers-to-be”; i.e., the nuMoM2b study. Using the cohort of 10,038 nulliparous women, we will efficiently accomplish 3 Aims: to integrate genetic, clinical, and molecular features towards a deep understanding of APOs; to develop machine learning models for advanced risk prediction; and to engage in active data collection towards risk assessment and model development. Using a close collaboration between computational and clinical scientists, we believe this proposal will result in important advances in understanding the molecular and clinical aspects of APOs as well as assessing the risk for APOs and thus providing tangible contributions to maternal health.

"Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients Failure to rescue (FTR), a nurse-sensitive national metric of health care quality, refers to death of a hospitalized patient from a treatable complication, and is potentiated by failure to recognize and appropriately respond to early signs of complications. There is a paucity of research examining patient features predictive of FTR complications. Such information could shift the current paradigm of nursing surveillance to earlier recognition, prevention and treatment of FTR complications, thereby saving lives. New-onset venous thromboembolism (VTE), an FTR complication occurring as either a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE), is the leading cause of preventable hospital death, carrying a high risk of mortality and a national cost burden of $7 billion annually. VTE is a complex disease process involving interactions between clinical risk factors and acquired and/or inherited susceptibilities to thrombosis. Although biomarkers and clinical factors associated with VTE have been identified, clinical manifestations are subtle, presenting gradually over hours to days. Current VTE risk assessment models (RAM), the cornerstone of prevention, have limited utility due to their complexity and lack of reliability, generalizability and external validation. A critical gap in VTE risk modeling research is that while new-onset VTE pathology evolves over the course of hospitalization, no current models incorporate the progressive accrual of dynamic patient data and pattern evolution over time in their modeling approaches. The totality of routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data is massive in terms of volume, variety, and production at a rapid velocity in real-time. Such big data could be used in machine learning (ML) analytic approaches to process time series clinical data to identify subtle, evolving feature patterns predictive of new-onset VTE and address this gap. This study proposes to assemble a large scale, multi-source, multi-dimensional VTE study dataset, and in tandem, systematically define the EHR data elements associated with a new-onset VTE diagnosis for computable phenotype algorithm development. We will then apply machine learning analytic approaches to baseline and accruing intensive time series clinical data in the curated dataset to develop models identifying data patterns and features predictive of dynamically evolving new-onset VTE in adult hospitalized patients. This proposal aligns with NINR’s strategic vision for nurse scientists to employ new strategies for collecting and analyzing complex big data sets to permit better understanding of the biological underpinnings of health, and improve ways nurses prevent and manage illness. This innovative study and individualized training plan under a strong and well- established team, represents initial steps in the applicant’s research trajectory focused on data science approaches to predict FTR complication risk, and develop, implement and test dynamic RAMs to inform targeted prevention and treatment decisions. Discovering new knowledge informing real-time decision making, nursing surveillance practices and care delivery systems can improve nurse sensitive patient outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of preventable hospital death. This study first proposes to develop a reproducible computable phenotype definition for new-onset VTE cohort ascertainment from the electronic health record, and then develop dynamic models for VTE risk assessment through the application of machine learning algorithms to massive electronic health record clinical data repositories. Such models can inform the mechanisms underlying this complex disease and identify subtle pattern changes in a patient’s condition forecasting a VTE event, enabling earlier nurse identification and intervention, and decreasing the development of complications and failure to rescue in hospitalized patients.",Machine Learning to Determine Dynamically Evolving New-Onset Venous Thromboembolic (VTE) Event Risk in Hospitalized Patients,10219195,F31NR018102,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Quality of Care', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Vision', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'care delivery', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computable phenotypes', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multidimensional data', 'prevent', 'venous thromboembolism']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2020,17002,0.012287541583472686
"Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse PROJECT SUMMARY Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvulopathy affecting over 170 million worldwide. Every year, 0.4- 1.9% of individuals with MVP will develop sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD), and 7% of SCDs in the young are caused by MVP. However, predictors of this devastating outcome are not readily available, and indications for a primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in MVP are lacking. Severe mitral regurgitation explains only 50% of SCA cases in MVP. SCD/SCA risk has also been linked to a bileaflet phenotype with mild MR, mitral annular disjunction (MAD), and left ventricular focal fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images. Such imaging parameters (including LGE) have not been evaluated prospectively. Moreover, they are not consistently found in SCA survivors, and diffuse fibrosis has been proposed as an alternative arrhythmic substrate by our group and others based on CMR/T1 mapping, strain echocardiography, and post-mortem data. Overall, it is challenging to pinpoint a unique imaging phenotype, and uncertainty exists about which MVP patients should undergo CMR. Regardless of arrhythmic phenotype, complex ventricular ectopy (ComVE - defined as frequent polymorphic PVCs, bigeminy or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) is detected in 80-100% of MVP cases prior to SCA or SCD. ComVE, commonly associated with left ventricular fibrosis on CMR, is linked to higher all-cause mortality and SCA rates (20% versus 12% if no ComVE, p < 0.05) based on preliminary cross-sectional data. Our central hypothesis is that MVP patients with ComVE, because of the higher prevalence of either LGE or abnormal T1 mapping, represent ideal CMR candidates regardless of leaflet involvement or MAD, and can be rapidly identified by an automated “surveillance” tool within a large echocardiographic database. Moreover, we hypothesize that fibrosis is the strongest predictor of SCD/SCA in an unprecedented, multi-center effort to longitudinally assess clinical and CMR parameters of arrhythmic risk in MVP. Specifically, we aim to 1) Assess the role of CMR as a screening tool for fibrosis in MVP with ComVE incorporating T1 mapping in addition to LGE in an unselected MVP sample; 2) Develop an echo-based machine-learning algorithm to detect MVP with ComVE, test its association with myocardial fibrosis on CMR and longitudinal SCD/SCA risk; and 3) Build a novel prospective SCD/SCA risk prediction model in MVP. Better selection of CMR candidates and development of a SCD/SCA risk prediction tool inclusive of fibrosis by CMR are expected to dramatically improve risk stratification in MVP and establish future criteria for primary prevention ICD trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, 0.4-1.9% of individuals with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) will develop sudden cardiac death or arrest. In this application we propose to better identify those at risk by using cardiac magnetic resonance and echocardiography-based artificial intelligence, with the long-term goal of selecting those that may benefit most from a defibrillator. .",Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse,10034460,R01HL153447,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Echocardiography', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'High Prevalence', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mission', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Mitral Valve Prolapse', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Prevention', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Screening procedure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'prognostic significance', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'risk prediction model', 'secondary analysis', 'stem', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,810751,0.03645716294550555
"Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes ABSTRACT Diabetic patients are at risk of developing diabetic heart disease, which may lead to complications in care. Diabetic heart disease patients not only have exceptionally high healthcare expenditures and resource utilization but also are likely to have poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that early intervention of patients likely to develop diabetic heart disease is cost-effective and yields favorable health outcomes. Therefore, early identiﬁcation of diabetic patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease is crucial to provide effective interventions. The commonly accepted methodology for diabetic heart disease risk prediction is the use of one or more risk scoring systems. However, these risk functions may not generalize well for the diabetes patient and may suffer from poor calibration when used on different cohorts. Moreover, the scoring systems have only been studied on coronary heart disease, one variant of diabetic heart disease while heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy remain important, yet insufﬁciently studied problems. Machine learning offers the ability to perform accurate predictive analytics and has been proposed as a way to identify and manage high-risk patients. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a high-impact and practical risk prediction model that can be used to per- form early identiﬁcation of high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of patient information in electronic health records, the model needs to capitalize on the multi-dimensional temporal nature of pa- tient records to extract identifying characteristics of patients that will develop diabetic heart disease. To accomplish this, we will leverage modern machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization and natural language processing to model complex patient characteristics, provide a more complete representation of the patient, and uncover excellent predictors of diabetic heart disease risk. An existing dataset that contains the de-identiﬁed electronic health records of approximately 4,100 diabetic patients from the Emory Healthcare System to compare the predictive power of machine learning-based algorithms with the standard risk scoring systems. These algorithms will be evaluated on calibration, discrimination, and ease of interpretability. The results of this work will provide insight as to how to develop a machine learning–based prediction system that can identify high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. The study may also shed light on the best approaches for fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources to build a better predictive model and potentially identify novel indicators of high- risk diabetic heart disease factors. Moreover, the work will help inform a larger multi-site study of diabetic heart disease risk prediction and develop methods to generalize the results to a broader spectrum of comorbidities. This project is consistent with the National Library of Medicine's mission to translate biomedical research into practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic patients are risk of developing diabetic heart disease which can lead to high healthcare expenditure, high resource utilization, and poor patient outcomes. Existing diabetic risk prediction models can suffer from poor calibration and predictive accuracy. This project develops a novel and practical analytic tool to identify patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease.",Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes,9939687,K01LM012924,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Congestive', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic cardiomyopathy', 'diabetic patient', 'effective intervention', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiologic data', 'heart disease risk', 'heterogenous data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research to practice', 'risk prediction model', 'secondary analysis', 'structured data']",NLM,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,179604,0.04308397548204485
"Using Big Data to Understand Sepsis in an Immunocompromised Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Through this proposal, I will develop and evaluate a sepsis prediction tool targeted to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Allogeneic HCT recipients are an immunocompromised population that is disproportionately affected by sepsis, a life-threatening dysregulated immunologic response to an infection. While it is well established that early detection and treatment of sepsis with fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics reduce the risk of mortality, recent data suggests early broad-spectrum antibiotic use in allogeneic HCT recipients may have microbiota-mediated detrimental effects on morbidity and mortality. Because of the risks associated with both missed and falsely identified sepsis events among allogeneic HCT recipients, early and accurate sepsis diagnosis is crucial. However, sepsis is generally challenging to diagnose and is made more complicated in allogeneic HCT recipients by the fact that sepsis presents differently following transplantation and common complications of the transplant procedure present like sepsis. In previous work, we demonstrated that current sepsis clinical criteria have low predictive value among allogeneic HCT recipients and concluded that population specific prediction tools are needed. Recently developed single algorithm, machine learning sepsis prediction tools have shown promising results in general, immuno-competent populations. However, few studies have tested the ability of machine learning workflows to predict sepsis in high-risk, immunocompromised patients, such as allogeneic HCT recipients. Additionally, current sepsis prediction tools rely on the assumption that the true relationship between the predictors and the outcome is contained within a single algorithm. This proposed work has two main objectives. The first is to develop an automated sepsis prediction tool for allogeneic HCT recipients using a state-of-the-art ensemble-based machine learning workflow (the super learner) that relaxes the single algorithm assumption of current sepsis prediction tools. The second is to estimate the utility of this tool in comparison to currently available tools in both traditional (accuracy methods) and novel ways (mathematical modeling of health outcomes). Both aims will be completed with the ultimate goal of improving sepsis prediction among allogeneic HCT recipients and in such, reducing sepsis related mortality and inappropriate antibiotic use among this hard to diagnose population. Further, this research will advance the methodological discussion around the usefulness of machine learning prediction tools in clinical practice and the use of ensemble modeling for prediction of rare, high-case fatality diseases. Such advances have the potential to improve the prediction of health outcomes beyond sepsis and reduce the burden of treatable diseases among immunocompromised populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening dysregulated host response to an infection that disproportionately affects allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Early detection and appropriate antibiotic therapy have been shown to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with sepsis, but clinical criteria currently recommended in sepsis detection have poor predictive value among HCT recipients. This project consists of the development of an automated, population-specific sepsis diagnostic tool and an estimate of the health implications of tool implementation.",Using Big Data to Understand Sepsis in an Immunocompromised Population,10064529,F31HL154509,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Streptococcus', 'System', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cancer care', 'clinical practice', 'data cleaning', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'neural network', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'random forest', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2020,45082,0.024441042127800683
"Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction Project Summary Early disease prevention, detection, and intervention are fundamental goals for advancing human health. Meanwhile, genetic risk is, for all intents and purposes, the earliest significant contributor to common, heritable, disease risk. Thus, in theory, genetic profiling should be the ideal tool for early disease prevention. Yet, genetic factors are rarely used directly to predict future disease risk. Rather, genetic information is typically relegated to phenotype-first scenarios: providing or confirming diagnoses for individuals with overt disease or clarifying the genetic risk for individuals with a strong family history of disease. For modern genomics to make a significant impact on disease prevention the use of genomic information must transition to a genotype-first approach; prediction of genetic disease risk in otherwise healthy individuals. A major barrier to this transition includes our limited ability to predict the precise array of risks and likely phenotypic expression of disease in an individual from genetic and other risk factors. The degree of disease risk and phenotypic expression conveyed to any single individual by genetic factors is a result of a complex interplay between direct and indirect genetic effects, other unmodifiable risk factors (age, gender, ancestry, family history), and intermediate modifiable risk factors (environment, behavior, laboratory values, health status, therapy status, etc.) many of which have their own direct genetic mediators. New approaches are required to dissect this interplay in order to personalize and contextualize preventative actions that most effectively reduce overall disease risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is the development of innovative Deep learning and machine-learning approaches to integrate baseline genetic risk predictions with the measurement of traditional risk factors in order to provide more accurate and actionable predictions of disease risk. By tying genetic risk to traditional risk factors, especially modifiable risk factors, we will enable actionability by allowing both a determination of preventative actions that may be especially effective because they offset genetic risk, as well as the identification of modifiable risk factors that should be monitored and controlled proactively given increased genetic predisposition. To accomplish this goal, we propose to develop methods to: (1) infer the likely phenotypic expressivity of monogenic risk variants via a spatial covariance machine learning approach, (2) predict prevalent disease cases and the expected value of intermediate modifiable risk factors from polygenic and other unmodifiable risk factors, and finally (3) predict prevalent disease cases through interactions between baseline genetic expectations and observed (measured) intermediate modifiable risk factors in a deep learning framework. Adjusting age and modifiable risk factors in these trained models would then allow for the interactive projection of future disease risk and the identification of modifiable risk factors that, when manipulated, lead to the greatest change in future disease risk. We focus on the development of methods for coronary artery disease given its public health importance, the known utility of polygenic risk estimation, and the current evidence for polygene-by-environment interactions. In addition, the approach we propose integrates directly with current clinical decision support tools for coronary artery disease management. However, we will build a general framework that can be extended to any common heritable adult-onset condition, especially those with known heritable, traditional risk factors Project Narrative Significant investment has been placed in the identification of genetic risk factors for common diseases. Yet, outside of family history, genetic risk is almost never included in routine clinical risk assessments. The goal of this proposal is to develop deep learning methods for the integration of genetic and traditional risk factors into comprehensive disease risk prediction.",Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction,10051655,R01HG010881,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Onset of illness', 'Output', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'data standards', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'feature extraction', 'feedforward neural network', 'genetic information', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'modifiable risk', 'multitask', 'novel strategies', 'personalized intervention', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'variant of unknown significance']",NHGRI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,790452,0.0193406936183202
"Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) is a lethal neoplasm and a common hematologic malignancy. MM is uniformly preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Unlike MM, patients with MGUS are asymptomatic. The current management for MGUS is watchful waiting for disease progression. A marked racial disparity in this disease area is long-established with a 2 to 3-fold increased risk in African Americans (AAs) compared to Caucasians. Moreover, obesity is a risk factor for MM independent of race. Obesity is prevalent in U.S. adults, and particularly more prevalent among AAs than Caucasians. As a result, without any intervention, racial disparities in this disease will continue to worsen. Metformin, a widely-used, safe, well- tolerated, and inexpensive medication, induces weight loss and has been found to be more effective in glycemic control in AAs compared to Caucasians. It has also been used in prospective trials for non-diabetes indications and solid tumor malignancies. We therefore hypothesize that metformin use in MGUS patients will prevent MM and reduce MM disparities. This project plans to focus on the precursor condition of MM – MGUS. The findings from the proposed project will inform biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials. The long-term goal is to identify intervention strategies to prevent the progression of MGUS to MM, reduce the overall burden of MM, and reduce MM disparities. We plan to identify whether high body mass index (BMI) and/or significant change in BMI over the life course are risk factors for MGUS by race (Aim 1), utilizing linked databases with nearly lifelong follow-up of BMI and other health measures ,as well as utilizing artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning approaches, to perform big data analyses. We will then assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory after MGUS diagnosis in metformin versus non-metformin users in a subgroup of MGUS patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (Aim 2.1) and the association of metformin use with the progression of MGUS to MM (Aim 2.2). Last, we will assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory in the subgroup of MGUS patients without diabetes mellitus (Aim 3). This project is significant in its capability to 1) identify perhaps the only modifiable risk factor (high BMI) to inform interventions to prevent MM; 2) identify a dynamic marker for disease progression by race (M-protein concentration), where these biomarkers can be a surrogate for MM diagnosis in future prevention trials; and 3) reduce MM health disparities by a) identifying race-specific biomarkers for MGUS and MGUS progression, available through clinical encounters (as opposed to expensive genetic testing); and b) exploring metformin use as a chemopreventive measure. It is innovative in its 1) focus on MM prevention rather than treatment and 2) utilization of artificial intelligence to analyze big data. Successful completion of this study will provide evidence for a paradigm shift in current clinical practice of MGUS management and help prevent MM, an incurable and costly disease. More importantly, it will provide evidence to guide interventions to reduce MM disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in multiple myeloma (MM), a common and incurable malignancy whose management is extremely costly, are long-established. Although MM is preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by many years, no established prevention strategies exist and current clinical practice does not treat patients with MGUS; thus, racial disparities for this disease are expected to persist or even worsen due to the disproportionate burden of obesity – a known risk factor for MM – in the African American population. This project plans to study racial differences in risk factors/biomarkers for MGUS and the progression of MGUS to MM to inform future biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials with the goal of reducing MM health disparities.",Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective,10055834,R01CA253475,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caucasians', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Department of Defense', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metformin', 'Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Neoplasms', 'Obesity', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Race', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Subgroup', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'carcinogenicity', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'diabetic', 'follow-up', 'genetic testing', 'glycemic control', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'innovation', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'specific biomarkers', 'working group']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,360281,-0.016031632978245232
"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

"Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major health problem affecting over 5 million people in the US leading to significant morbidity and even mortality. Therapy for this epidemic is suboptimal, with success of 30-70% at 1 year for most therapies. Despite great advances in understanding potential AF mechanisms, these insights have not yet translated into better AF therapy. The scientific focus of the project centers on the issue of identifying novel phenotypes for the heterogeneous conditions that currently fall under the rubric of AF. Machine learning is an approach well-suited to identify novel classifications from large diverse data sets that are traditionally difficult to separate. I will use machine learning and computational methods to analyze detailed clinical, structural, cardiac electrophysiological and biochemical features in patients with AF, to better predict responders and non-responders to various therapies. This may enable prospective guidance to tailor personalized therapy. In performing this project, I will grow as a physician-scientist focused on patient-oriented research in atrial fibrillation. The specific aims of the scientific project are as follows: First, I will create a novel disease taxonomy for AF that classifies patients successfully treated by risk factor modification, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, or diverse approaches to ablation, using computational methods and supervised learning on large training data from my collaborators. I will assess the predictive efficacy of these disease partitions in a testing cohort of patients referred for treatment of AF. Second, I will use advanced techniques in machine learning and patient-level analyses to explain why a certain strategy may fail or succeed in an individual, paving the way for clinical use. Third, in a pilot prospective clinical study, I will assess the feasibility and accuracy of these machine learning models. The findings from these experiments may provide an immediate clinical impact by delivering AF therapy options in a patient-specific manner that optimizes benefit while reducing risk. In addition, under the balanced and expert mentorship provided by this award, I will gain the necessary computational modelling, clinical research design and biostatistical methodology experience to design comprehensive studies and be competitive for independent funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent heart rhythm disorder in adults, which may lead to significant morbidity, mortality and economic burden. The results of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapy remain suboptimal, despite the fact that mechanistic data in patients are increasing on atrial structure, electrophysiology and clinical risk factors yet are rarely used to individualize AF therapy to each patient. In this project, computational methods and machine learning are proposed to harmonize large amounts of data, including clinical factors, imaging studies and cardiac signals, to provide tools to devise an individualized AF management strategy.",Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation,9995010,K23HL145017,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biometry', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Flecainide', 'Freedom', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life Style Modification', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nonpharmacologic Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Registries', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Work', 'clinical center', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diverse data', 'dofetilide', 'economic implication', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'functional outcomes', 'heart rhythm', 'imaging study', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,193536,0.02286508083997768
"The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence Project Summary Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are the most common types of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the world. VBD epidemics have been increasing over recent decades, with tickborne diseases having doubled in the last decade in the United States. Despite the increase in public health burden, over 80% of vector-control organizations lack preventative capabilities. Understanding the interplay between the environment, vectors, pathogens, and humans that expedite disease spread remains a challenge. The overarching goal of this project is to identify the key environmental and human drivers that have led to the emergence of VBDs. Current models that predict tickborne disease risk have oversimplified the process by focusing only on the vector, i.e. risk of tick exposure. A human’s risk of infection is not only a function of entomological risk but also of factors inherent to the individual including behavior or characteristics that increase susceptibility to disease. This project proposes a novel approach to tickborne disease prediction by developing a comprehensive model that incorporate pathogen population dynamics and human factors to predict disease risk. This study will investigate several pathogens vectored by the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis): Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic anaplasmosis), and Babesia microti (babesiosis). The central hypothesis is that the prediction of tickborne disease risk can be improved by using sophisticated statistical methods to identify environmental drivers that impact pathogen population dynamics while incorporating human demographic characteristics. The hypothesis will be addressed in the following aims: (1) Determine the current and historical population dynamic patterns of pathogens vectored by I. scapularis to predict pathogen distribution; (2) Determine the association between human characteristics and tick-borne disease risk in order to develop an improved spatial disease risk model. This model will allow the identification and quantification of factors that are associated with the emergence of tickborne diseases in New York State, which is geographically advantageous because it is representative of much of the natural environment that ticks encounter in the northeastern US including rapid and recent changes in climate and landscapes. The results of this project will be used to develop a public disease warning system that will use contemporary and future climate forecasts to monitor tick populations and predict potential disease outbreaks for areas with vulnerable populations. With climate forecasts predicting an increase in 2-3°C in temperature by 2100, there is uncertainty in how diseases will shift and a warning system will allow preparation accordingly. At the completion of the proposed research project, the applicant will have acquired the following skillsets through intensive, interdisciplinary mentorship: big data analysis, advanced statistics including Bayesian and machine learning methods, spatial analyses, and risk analysis. This will enable the applicant to succeed as an independent investigator to address the challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases are the most common types of emerging infectious diseases in the world and constitute major threats to public health. My project uses advanced statistical methods to uncover how interactions between environmental factors affecting pathogen population dynamics and human demographic characteristics determine human risk for three tick-borne diseases: Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. The results of my project will be used to create a risk map to predict the spatial and temporal occurrence of tickborne diseases, which can inform public health strategies in order to mitigate disease burden.",The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence,10018461,F31AI133871,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anaplasma phagocytophilum', 'Anaplasmosis', 'Area', 'Award', 'Babesia microti', 'Babesiosis', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Black-legged Tick', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Characteristics', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Contracts', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecological Change', 'Ecology', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Entomology', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'New York', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'Tick-Borne Infections', 'Ticks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'anthropogenesis', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cost effective', 'decision tree learning', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'environmental change', 'geographic population', 'granulocyte', 'human disease', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogen exposure', 'predictive modeling', 'regression trees', 'spatial temporal variation', 'statistics', 'tick bite', 'tick-borne pathogen', 'trend', 'vector', 'vector control', 'vector transmission']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,38185,0.021062590204118534
"Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Because suicidal behavior (i.e., suicide and suicide attempt) significantly contributes to global disease and financial burden, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, the World Health Organization, and prominent researchers have called for the need to develop and improve prediction models for suicidal behavior. The period after contact with a health care professional is a particularly high-risk period, suggesting that prediction of suicidal behavior in the short-term after contact (i.e., defined as within one year in most studies) would address a critical need in the field to aid intervention efforts. However, previous short-term research has been limited by numerous factors, including a lack of research on youth samples, an overreliance on self-report measures or electronic health records, and the frequent examination of bivariate associations between only one predictor and suicidal behavior. The overall objective of the current proposal is to utilize several algorithms and assess their relative performance in the prediction of short-term suicidal behavior after contact with an outpatient specialist (defined as within 1, 6, and 12 months) using an unparalleled dataset. I will use data from a prospective, large-scale register of all outpatient mental health specialist visits among youth in Stockholm County, Sweden, consisting of approximately 160,000 visits by the onset of the current award. These individuals can be linked to population-based registers assessing a broad range of information (e.g., medical problems, academic information, neighborhood factors, parental psychopathology), which is a significant advantage over prior literature primarily studying demographic and psychiatric predictors in isolation. The central hypothesis is that the examination of numerous predictors within a large sample and the use of advanced statistical methods will significantly improve upon previous suicidal behavior prediction, which has remained slightly above chance. To achieve the overall objective, the current proposal is designed to apply machine learning algorithms through two specific aims: Aim 1: Apply variable selection algorithms that determine a limited number of salient predictors and, therefore, maximize interpretability; Aim 2: Apply ensemble algorithms that aggregate machine learning models and, therefore, maximize predictive power. The current proposal will significantly contribute to the field by examining short-term risk using machine learning techniques among a youth, outpatient sample, including varying follow-up windows and predictors across domains. Finally, the results from the current proposal will have positive impact by informing both 1) basic research through the identification of at-risk subgroups based on numerous predictors, and 2) the creation of a prediction tool that will aid in clinical practice. Project Narrative Over the past 50 years, prediction of suicidal behavior has remained slightly above chance levels, significantly hindering the development of effective intervention strategies. Because the majority of those who attempt or die by suicide are in contact with a health care professional within the year prior to their death, the current proposal serves to fill a critical gap in suicidal behavior prediction by exploring prediction methods for suicidal behavior among youth in the short-term (i.e., within 1, 6, and 12 months) after contact with an outpatient mental health specialist using an unparalleled dataset. Findings from the current proposal will have implications for clinical practice by identifying high-risk individuals for short-term suicidal behavior and aid clinical decision-making.",Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach,9981424,F31MH121039,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sweden', 'Techniques', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'World Health Organization', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'translational pipeline']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F31,2020,45520,-0.11691989508263805
"Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease Project Summary  Cardiovascular disease negatively affects millions of people worldwide. Globally, it accounts for approximately thirty percent of all deaths. Furthermore, a significant fraction of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease occur in a non-geriatric population; fifteen percent of all worldwide deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease for people under the age of seventy. Treatment to prevent cardiovascular events should be based on highly individualized risk prediction. High risk patients should get more aggressive treatments because the risk of disease outweighs the burden of treatment, while low risk patients should be managed more conservatively. For example, anti-thrombotic therapy for coronary heart disease may increase bleeding risk and may not be appropriate for low-risk patients. Two primary kinds of cardiovascular disease are stroke and coronary heart disease, and there have been a number of developments in risk scores for both ailments. However, these risk scores only use a small fraction of the available measurements about a patient and treat risk as a collection of independent factors rather than considering how their interactions amplify or ameliorate risk. Moreover, a majority of the popular coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores are designed to be manually computed by a busy physician at the point of care, which further limits their scope and fidelity. Next generation risk scores for stroke and cardiovascular disease should take into account all of the available information in the electronic health record without the constraints of the parametric assumptions of traditional risk modeling. More accurate risk assessment of coronary heart disease and stroke will lead to better care and reduce the cardiovascular disease burden.  Our vision is to capitalize on large collections of electronic health records along with recent advances in deep learning to build risk scores that use more available health information while making minimal mathematical assumptions about the nature of clinical risk. Our proposal propels the field from human computable independent risks calculations necessitated by previous limitations of technology to calculations that make use of deep learning to learn highly nonlinear risks and risk factor interactions. We additionally demonstrate how deep learning can be used to deal with the ever-present issue of missing values in medicine. Our proposal also targets an area under- explored by previous work on risk scores: fairness. Treatment quality is affected by the quality of risk estimation. This means populations where estimated risk is less accurate may receive worse care. Risk scores developed with simple models may only capture risk accurately for the majority population as simple models are not flexible enough to cover multiple populations. We seek to identify potential risk calculation differences with respect to race and ethnicity. We will construct and evaluate deep learning methods for coronary heart disease and stroke risk assessment from electronic health records. We will develop techniques to incorporate clinical text, handle missing data, and evaluate fairness of deep learning for cardiovascular risk scores. Finally, we will make our work available as open source code written in deep learning frameworks, at clinical conferences, and publications. Project Narrative Coronary heart disease and stroke create a large burden of disease in the world and require accurate risk assessment to aid in providing appropriate treatments. We will construct and validate deep learning risk scores for both coronary heart disease and stroke using large quantities of information from the electronic health record and take care to evaluate potential racial and ethnic biases present in the algorithm. More accurate coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores provided by this approach have the potential to reduce the overall cardiovascular disease burden with a specific focus on minority communities.",Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease,9939641,R01HL148248,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical conference', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'ethnic bias', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'heart disease risk', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'negative affect', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'stroke model', 'stroke risk', 'thromboembolic stroke']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,681289,-0.03103387830186329
"Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment Postoperative complications and readmissions rates are higher in minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) patients. Low SES is associated with frailty, one of the best predictors of 30-day postoperative complications and early hospital readmission. Despite their influence on health outcomes, frailty and social risk factors are not considered in risk adjustment for reimbursement and quality measures. CMS developed financial incentive- based programs to improve quality of care. Yet this strategy disproportionately penalizes minority-serving, major teaching and safety net hospitals (SNH), further constraining resources for the care of vulnerable populations. Our long-term goal is to use frailty and social risk factors to identify at-risk patients to design more effective clinical care pathways. Frailty can be derived retrospectively using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) dataset. Data networks are powerful research tools that can be used to answer important questions. However, extracting data from EHR is challenging. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) developed 13 Clinical Data Research Networks (CDRN) that have considerable overlapping membership with Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) institutions. While steady progress has been made, multiple barriers exist to efficiently access and use data. We will engage 3 CTSA hubs, each members of a different CDRN, to locally merge identified datasets developing data accessing and linking strategies at diverse institutions for dissemination across sites within CDRNs and to ultimately perform similar studies across CDRNs. We will use the SMART IRB reliance platform to harmonize the regulatory approval process as much as possible for each step of this project to identify barriers to use in data networks. We propose the following Aims: 1) Determine the predictive power of ethnicity, race, SES, and frailty for postoperative complications, mortality  and readmissions to improve risk adjustment at 3 CTSA/CDRNs 2) Estimate postoperative functional status using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning  algorithms on inpatient physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and nursing notes for ACS NSQIP  patients to predict long-term functional status 3) Develop methods to predict long-term loss of independence after major surgery 4) Determine hospital resource utilization stratified by SES, frailty and minority status The significance of our study is the incorporation of social risk factors, frailty and functional status in risk adjustment forming the basis for future interventions by targeting patients at the highest risk for postoperative complications and reducing health care disparities. Our innovative approach harnesses data sources at diverse institutions with the goal of disseminating these methods across 3 CDRNs and the CTSA network. Project Narrative: Patients with social risk factors, including poverty, being a minority, lack of an education and frailty are all associated with having worse health outcomes and with more difficulties recovering after surgical procedures. Safety net hospitals take care of many people with social risk factors and are being judged on the quality of care provided without accounting for the challenges faced by poor people. We will study the effect of social risk factors and frailty on health outcomes after surgery to identify patients that would benefit from care pathways that help poor and/or frail people.","Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment",9981049,U01TR002393,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Community Surveys', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physical therapy', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Recovery of Function', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic data', 'financial incentive', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'payment', 'postoperative recovery', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'readmission rates', 'safety net', 'simulation', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,U01,2020,100000,0.044029561234000085
"Machine Learning to Optimize Management of Acute Hydrocephalus Patients 37,000 patients a year receive an external ventricular drain (EVD) in the setting of acute hydrocephalus in the US, generating in-hospital charges of $151,672 per patient, or $5.6 billion dollars a year. There is great motivation in the neurointensive care unit for the optimization of EVD management to reduce infection rates, accurately determine need for permanent shunting, and to do so efficiently in order to minimize duration of drainage and length of stay (LOS). Risk factors for ventriculitis include EVD duration, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling frequency, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and insertion technique. Severe CSF disturbances in patients with IVH and EVDs limit the value of routine CSF analysis for ventriculitis prediction. And ventriculitis diagnosis is imprecise, with only a minority declaring culture positivity while all still demanding antibiotic treatment and delay of permanent shunt. This leads to unnecessary empiric antibiotic treatment and increased LOS (30.8 vs 22.6 days), with the associated cost ($30,335 more) and morbidity (e.g. Clostridium difficile infection, emergence of drug-resistant pathology). The process of determining permanent shunt dependence is variable between institutions, particularly around the decision of when to begin weaning the EVD or predicting delayed resolution. These decisions in the subacute period determine LOS and associated adverse events, exposure to radiography, and commitment to potentially unnecessary permanent foreign materials in the CNS, which then carry lifelong risks for infection and blockage. There is no accurate noninvasive test (that does not further introduce infection) to diagnose ventriculitis nor is there a timely method to predict need for permanent shunt after acute hydrocephalus. To fill this gap, we propose developing a quantitative model from intracranial pressure (ICP) waveform analysis to increase precision in the diagnosis of ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt. In previous work, we were able to predict with good accuracy who would need permanent shunt placement using ICP waveform analysis collected during a 24 hour clamp trial. However, a complex model can only be justified if it achieves a diagnosis earlier or more accurately than traditional clinical methods. In preliminary work, we clustered raw ICP waveforms and found a pattern of waveforms specific for ventriculitis that appears 1 day before diagnostic cultures are sent. Our central hypothesis is that there is a temporal quantitative signal in ICP waveform reflective of intracranial dynamics that can be harvested to optimize acute hydrocephalus management. Impact and Significance: Noninvasive quantitative models based on ICP waveform analysis that diagnose ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt would decrease the duration of EVD and the frequency of CSF sampling, two of the risk factors for ventriculitis, while also decreasing LOS, associated adverse events of ICU stay, and empiric antibiotics. There is no accurate noninvasive test to diagnose ventriculitis nor is there a timely method to predict need for permanent shunt after acute hydrocephalus. To fill this gap, we propose developing a quantitative model from intracranial pressure waveform analysis to increase precision in the diagnosis of ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt. Accurate noninvasive sequential machine learning models could decrease external ventricular drain duration and cerebrospinal fluid sampling frequency, two of the risk factors for ventriculitis, while also decreasing length of stay and empiric systemic antibiotics.",Machine Learning to Optimize Management of Acute Hydrocephalus Patients,10057040,R21NS113055,"['Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Caring', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Closure by clamp', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Drainage procedure', 'Drug resistance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Harvest', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Charges', 'Hour', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institution', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Ventricular', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'improved', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'intraventricular hemorrhage', 'long short term memory', 'recurrent neural network', 'vector']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2020,445500,0.012021775633698353
"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,10003227,R01DK116986,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'base', 'case-based', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'design', 'feature selection', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injury prevention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'prevent']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,506170,-0.023652506474927167
"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,9981397,R01HL148787,"['Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Event', 'Future', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'arm', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically significant', 'computerized', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary event', 'coronary plaque', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient registry', 'prognostic significance', 'prognostic value', 'prospective']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,714763,0.017136153364339837
"Leveraging machine learning to improve risk prediction for chemotherapy induced neuropathy Project Summary/Abstract Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) affects more than two-thirds of adults with invasive cancer who receive select adjuvant chemotherapies (e.g., taxanes, platinum analogs). Severe CIPN symptoms can lead to chemotherapy dose reductions, treatment delays, or changes in treatment regimens; thereby affecting the potential curative effects of chemotherapy. For some patients, CIPN symptoms can persist over time, contributing to lower quality of life.  Little is known about risk factors for CIPN. Chemotoxicity risk scores have been developed and evaluated for use among elderly patients receiving chemotherapy. However, these tools generally report moderate predictive accuracy (60%-70%), small sample sizes, and short-term follow up. We are aware of no publicly available, validated risk models to assess risk of severe and chronic CIPN among diverse patients at risk for this potentially disabling side effect.  The goal of this proposal is to identify patients at risk for CIPN and to understand how patients and provider interpret and use CIPN risk information in clinical decision-making. Focusing on more than 8,500 insured adults (18+) diagnosed with invasive, stage I-III breast and II-IIIA colorectal cancers (2013-2021) who received adjuvant chemotherapy treatment with known risk for CIPN, we will develop and validate predictive models to quantify the risk of severe CIPN and incident chronic CIPN and assess how CIPN risk information might be used to inform clinical decision-making about cancer treatment and survivorship care planning.  We hypothesize that CIPN risk is a high priority for patients in thinking about treatment choice and survivorship care planning. In addition, we hypothesize that the relative importance of CIPN risk for patient and provider decision-making will vary by patient characteristics (e.g., age, cancer stage). We anticipate that the risk of severe and chronic CIPN can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using electronic health records and machine learning methods.  The study team has significant and complementary expertise in health services research, biostatistics and predictive modeling, oncology practice, cancer epidemiology, pharmacotherapy, drug safety and the patient care experience. To our knowledge, this will be one of the first studies to develop and validate a CIPN predictive model that can be used by oncology teams to inform treatment and care planning decisions and improve patient-valued outcomes. Translation and replication of the findings will be catalyzed through publication in peer-reviewed journals and the development and distribution of free software to facilitate testing and adaptation of the resulting risk models across diverse systems of care. Narrative Two out of three people treated with select types of chemotherapy experience a side effect known as peripheral neuropathy that causes pain, discomfort and numbness in the extremities and contributes to poor quality of life. We do not know who is at greatest risk for this side effect or how patients and providers weigh the risks of neuropathy against the potentially life-saving benefits of cancer treatment. The proposed study will help identify patients at high risk for chemotherapy induced neuropathy and assess how patients and clinicians might use information about neuropathy risk to make better informed decisions about cancer care.",Leveraging machine learning to improve risk prediction for chemotherapy induced neuropathy,9955985,R01CA249127,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Breast', 'Cancer Survivorship', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Goals', 'Health Services Research', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neuropathy', 'Numbness', 'Obesity', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Platinum', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Savings', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Vinca Alkaloids', 'analog', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'care systems', 'chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy induced neuropathy', 'clinical decision-making', 'community based practice', 'comorbidity', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fall risk', 'follow-up', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical ability', 'medication safety', 'neurotoxicity', 'older patient', 'predictive modeling', 'side effect', 'survivorship', 'taxane', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,663447,0.03867327870383618
"Adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: improving and validating risk prediction ABSTRACT: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) predominantly affects women during reproductive years, raising concerns regarding maternal and fetal health during pregnancy. Although physicians no longer uniformly discourage women with SLE from childbearing, patients face 20% likelihood of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO), including preeclampsia, fetal and neonatal death, growth restriction, and preterm delivery, even during clinical disease quiescence. Because there are no established instruments to predict APO in individual patients, SLE pregnancies are intensely monitored at an emotional cost to patients and financial burden to society. The ability to identify, early in pregnancy, patients at high risk of APO would significantly enhance our capacity to clinically manage patients. Furthermore, validated risk stratification models are needed to design and execute trials to prevent APOs. In PROMISSE, the largest multi-center, multi-ethnic and multi-racial study of pregnant SLE patients to date, several risk factors were identified as significant predictors of APO. Although a major advance, these results have neither been externally validated nor shown to generalize to independent study populations. Moreover, risk factors were identified using standard statistical models that did not fully account for complex effects of multiple predictor variables. In this project, an international team of SLE, obstetric and biostatistics researchers, led by PROMISSE investigators, will rigorously develop and externally validate an APO prediction model by leveraging data from PROMISSE (N=447), as well as five independent cohorts of lupus patients from different countries (total N = 979). In Aim 1, powerful machine learning algorithms will be applied to PROMISSE data to create an accurate and clinically useful model to predict APOs in SLE patients. To maximize utility of this model in the real world, only clinical and laboratory features that are routinely and accurately assessed on SLE patients during clinical care will be considered as potential predictors. In Aim 2, the APO model will be externally validated in prospective cohorts of pregnant lupus patients from Europe (France: N=246; Germany: N=180; Norway: N=349) and regions in the US, not included in PROMISSE (South Carolina: N=82; Bronx, NY: N=122). These cohorts are heterogeneous with respect to race, ethnicity, socioeconomic strata, and SLE disease activity, allowing for a thorough investigation into generalizability and transportability of the APO model to diverse lupus patient populations. In each cohort, detailed baseline and longitudinal clinical, laboratory and pregnancy outcome data have been obtained using procedures similar to those in PROMISSE. The overarching goal is development of an online risk calculator that will significantly improve real world clinical decision making and enable risk stratification for future APO prevention trials. Impact: An accurate, validated, and user-friendly prediction model for APO is necessary for effective clinical care of pregnant lupus patients, optimal allocation of healthcare resources, and the design of and recruitment to future clinical trials of experimental interventions to prevent APO. Project Narrative Pregnancies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at increased risk for poor outcomes, such as very premature delivery, fetal death or growth restriction, yet there are no validated instruments to predict pregnancy outcomes in individual patients and focus care on those most likely to have serious complications. Our proposal is to develop and validate a prediction model that can be used to identify, early in pregnancy, SLE patients at high risk for adverse outcomes. This tool will significantly enhance the capacity to manage these patients, optimize allocation of healthcare resources, and design and conduct trials of new treatments to prevent the placental insufficiency that can result in poor outcomes.",Adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: improving and validating risk prediction,9873121,R21AR076612,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Angiogenic Factor', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Antiphospholipid Antibodies', 'Antiphospholipid Syndrome', 'Autoantibodies', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement Activation', 'Complex', 'Conceptions', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Europe', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Financial Hardship', 'Financial cost', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'France', 'Future', 'Germany', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Coagulation Inhibitor', 'Maternal Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Norway', 'Outcome', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Placenta', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention trial', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Salmon', 'Schedule', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Carolina', 'Statistical Models', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Vascularization', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'child bearing', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'fetal', 'high risk', 'hypoperfusion', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'maternal risk', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal death', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'socioeconomics', 'study population', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIAMS,HOSPITAL FOR SPECIAL SURGERY,R21,2020,249418,0.023887991479064185
"Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study Efforts to decipher biological signatures for mental illness now focus increasingly on adolescence, a period of rapid brain development that immediately precedes the peak age of onset for many disorders. Maturation of the cerebral cortex during this time has long been thought to mediate emergence of early symptoms. However, while specific cortical changes have been implicated in a small number of specific syndromes, for the most part, patterns in cortical development that underlie the differentiation of psychopathology remain uncertain. The ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unprecedented opportunity to align emergence of specific patterns of psychopathology with specific changes in cortical maturation. Over the next 5 years, ABCD will obtain annual, standardized measures dimensional psychopathology, and biennial MRI scans, of 11,875 youths across 21 US-based sites, covering age 9 to 16. The proposed studies will leverage this longitudinal design to discover regionally- and temporally-specific features of cortical development that associate with emergence of dimensional psychopathology, and then to relate these patterns to specific profiles of underlying genomic and environmental risk. Analysis of baseline data from age 9-10, included in this application, indicates that psychopathology is in early stages of differentiation, although already strongly related to polygenic risk for child-onset disorders, and to well- established pre- and post-natal environmental insults. Aim 1 of the proposed studies will juxtapose clinical and imaging data from baseline through three follow-up time points, focusing primarily on whether departures from neurotypical age-related cortical thinning trajectories (assessed via intercept, slope, and quadratic indices) associate with emergence of specific dimensions of illness. The precise temporal alignment of clinical and cortical thinning trajectories will take an initial step towards inferring causal relationships, which will be further substantiated through triangulation with genomic (Aim 2) and environmental (Aim 3) risk profiles. Polygenic scoring methods developed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium will be used to determine whether cortical maturation trajectories developed in Aim 1 mediate relationships between genomic risk and emergent dimensional psychopathology. Then, using data from hundreds of environmental measures that canvass participants’ daily activities, nutrition, life stressors, socioeconomic status, family dynamics, neighborhood safety, and numerous other factors, we will use novel machine learning methods to develop profiles of exposomic risk factors that predict emergent dimensional psychopathology, and determine whether cortical maturation patterns mediate the relationship between environmental risk profiles and clinical course. By the conclusion of the proposed studies we hope to establish specific cortical signatures that bridge causal factors with emergent psychopathology in adolescence, and that can be leveraged to develop new preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Adolescence is a critical period for emergence of a range of psychiatric syndromes, as well as for maturation of the cerebral cortex. Investigators have long presumed these events to be linked, potentially in ways that can predict specific clinical outcomes, but until now we have lacked data from sufficiently large, prospective studies to establish definitive or tractable patterns. Leveraging data from the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (n=11,875), we will map emergent psychopathology across a range of symptoms to specific patterns of cortical development from age 9 to 16, and anchor these relationships to mediating genomic and environmental risk factors.",Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study,10096054,R01MH124694,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family dynamics', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'critical period', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'neighborhood safety', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal', 'psychiatric genomics', 'spatiotemporal', 'standardize measure', 'stressor', 'theories']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,413200,0.011647238116333704
"Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP) Abstract Placental abruption is an obstetrical complication defined as premature placental separation. Despite its elusive etiology, it is believed to be the consequence of acute stimuli – ischemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress at the maternal‐fetal interface – associated with rupture of the decidual artery, resulting in (premature) placental separation. The study of abruption and maternal and newborn long‐term cardiovascular and hemorrhagic/thrombotic cerebrovascular events is the central focus of the proposed project. We will examine the long‐term impact of abruption on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in women and in their children. We will also investigate the relationship of clinical classification (mild and severe forms) of abruption, risks based on abruption across successive pregnancies, and abruption in twin pregnancies, on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We will undertake a causal mediation analysis to evaluate the extent to which these associations may be mediated through (i) preterm delivery and (ii) small for gestational age births. We will perform this analysis by clinical classification of abruption and estimate the extent of mediation following corrections for both measured (socio‐demographic characteristics, including maternal smoking, comorbid medical conditions, and obstetrical events), and unmeasured confounding. A unique aspect of this project will be to identify, through applications of Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning algorithms, subsets of women at high risk for abruption and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. Finally, we will examine whether maternal race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status are effect measure modifiers of the association between abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We propose to address these aims through a large population‐based epidemiologic study, utilizing data from the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS), a New Jersey statewide database of all patients admitted to all non‐federal acute care hospitals in NJ with a CVD diagnosis, with longitudinal follow‐up of up to 30 years. The MIDAS data will be linked to the NJ fetal death and linked live birth‐ infant death data with associated maternal and newborn hospitalization data between 1980‐2017 to create one of the largest and most comprehensive databases in the US to evaluate the extent to which sentinel events in pregnancy impart lasting risk for women's and children's health later in life. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, policy implications and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE) The overarching goal of this project is to examine the associations between placental abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality later in life. The project will focus on overall associations, as well as identifying subsets of women at high risk based on abruption severity, recurrent abruptions, gestational age at delivery, and fetal growth restriction.

"Developing and validating EHR-integrated readmission risk prediction models for hospitalized patients with diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hospital readmission is an undesirable, costly outcome that may be preventable. Hospitalized patients with diabetes are at higher risk of readmission within 30 days (30-d readmission) than patients without diabetes, and >1 million readmissions occur among diabetes patients in the US annually. Certain interventions can reduce readmission risk, but applying these interventions widely is cost prohibitive. One approach for improving the efficiency of interventions that reduce readmission risk is to target high-risk patients. We previously published a model, the Diabetes Early Readmission Risk Indicator (DERRITM), that predicts the risk of all-cause 30-d readmission of patients with diabetes. The DERRI, however, has modest predictive accuracy (C-statistic 0.63- 0.69), and requires manual data input. Recently, we demonstrated that adding variables to the DERRI substantially improves predictive accuracy (DERRIplus, C-statistic 0.82). However, using this larger model to predict readmission risk based on manual input of data would be too labor intensive for clinical settings. Indeed, most readmission risk prediction models are limited by the trade-off between accuracy and ease of use; lack of translation to a tool that integrates with clinical workflow; modest accuracy; lack of validation; and dependence on data only available after hospital discharge.  The objectives of the current proposal are: 1) To develop more accurate all-cause unplanned 30-d readmission risk prediction models using electronic health record (EHR) data of patients with diabetes (eDERRI); 2) To translate the models to an automated, EHR-based tool that predicts % readmission risk of hospitalized patients; and 3) To prospectively validate the eDERRI models and tool. The new eDERRI models will expand upon the variables in the DERRIplus based on availability in EHR data (e.g., sociodemographics, encounter history, medication use, laboratory results, comorbidities, and length of stay). To develop the models, we will leverage data from the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN), a multi-center, 40-plus hospital member of the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet). We will apply state-of-the-art deep-learning methods to develop optimal predictive models. This project will analyze a large, multi-center cohort of nearly 340,000 discharges with cutting-edge techniques to develop better models and translate them to an automated tool that predicts readmission risk for individual patients with diabetes. The proposed tool would identify higher risk patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop more accurate models that predict the risk of repeat hospitalizations among patients with diabetes. The models will be programmed into a tool that will be integrated with an electronic health record system and automatically predict the re-hospitalization risk of patients. Such a tool could be used to identify higher risk diabetes patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs.",Developing and validating EHR-integrated readmission risk prediction models for hospitalized patients with diabetes,9971861,R01DK122073,"['Admission activity', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Paths', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patient Readmission', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comorbidity Index', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'readmission risk', 'risk prediction model', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2020,658109,0.034947950586474076
"A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice Abstract With growing interest in personalized medicine and the rise of machine learning, constructing good risk prediction and prognostic models has been drawing renewed attention. In this development, much effort is concentrated in identifying good predictors of patient outcomes, although the same level of rigor is often absent in improving the outcome side of prediction. The majority of popular supervised techniques (e.g., regularized logistic regression and its variations), which can be readily applied in risk model development, assumes that the prediction target is a clear single outcome measured at a single time point. In clinical reality, patient outcomes are often complex, multivariate, and measured with errors. Even when a target is a relatively clear univariate outcome (e.g., death, cancer, diabetes, etc), the process that leads to this ultimate outcome often involves complex intermediate outcomes, where predicting and understanding this intermediate process can be crucial in providing effective care and preventing negative ultimate outcomes. The situation calls for a ﬂexible learning framework that can easily incorporate this important but neglected aspect in model development - better characterizing and constructing prediction targets before building prediction models.  Focusing on risk labels as prediction targets, we propose a pragmatic 3-stage learning approach, where we sequentially 1) generate latent labels, 2) validate them using explicit validators, and 3) go on with supervised learning with labeled data. Latent variable (LV) strategies used in Satge 1 have great potentials in handling complex outcome information. The unsupervised nature of LV strategies makes highly ﬂexible data synthesis and organization possible. The same nature, however, can also be seen as esoteric and subjective, which is not desirable in situations where transparency and reproducibility are of great concern such as in risk prediction. As a practical solution to this problem, we propose the use of explicit clinical validators, which not only makes LV-based labels closely aligned with contemporary science and clinical practice, but also makes it possible to automatically validate and narrow a large pool of candidate labels. With the goal of developing a practical and transparent system of learning and inference for clinical research and practice, we formed a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in latent variable modeling, machine learning, psychometrics and causal inference along with clinical/substantive expertise. Our streamlined learning framework focuses on direct and transparent validation of latent variable solutions to ensure clear communication across risk model developers, clinical researchers and practitioners. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction. Narrative This project intends to develop a pragmatic learning and risk predction framework that will facilitate utilization of multivariate data collected from research and health care services, which otherwise is underutilized in developing methods to improve personalized care of future patients. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction, and therefore will have positive impact on public health.",A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice,10033908,R01MH123443,"['Address', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Intention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'data exploration', 'flexibility', 'health care service', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'model development', 'neglect', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction model', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,565519,0.0174089587680347
"Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA): Prediction and Prevention Project Summary: The recent advances in information technologies and biotechnologies is an opportunity to substantially improve healthcare. To exploit the power of data to benefit patients, however, effective clinical decision support tools and novel, individualized interventions must be designed, tested, and implemented.

Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) accounts for 15-20% of all adult deaths and is the industrial world’s leading cause of death. Clinical studies of SCA produce repeated measures on risk factors and multiple different kinds of events over time. We refer to these data as survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) data. In this project, we will develop novel statistical learning methods for SLAM data and apply them to two distinct aspects of the SCA problem. First, we propose to develop novel statistical learning algorithms that better predict an individual’s multivariate longitudinal data with a focus on the risk of first and subsequent SCA. Second, we propose to develop micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs to reduce behavioral risk factors for SCA among persons at high risk. The methods that we propose to develop will be applicable in many areas of medicine. However, they are motivated by and applied to SCA in this project. Our team has expertise in statistics including causal inference, longitudinal data and survival analyses, plus machine learning, epidemiology, cardiology, and behavioral interventions through mobile health (mHealth). This proposed collaboration has the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and test statistical learning tools for real-time risk prediction of survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) outcome data. Aim 2: Estimate the risk of SCA and its dependence on dynamic modifiable and non-modifiable factors in population-based and clinical cohorts. Aim 3: Plan and conduct a feasibility-usability study of micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs for behavioral change to reduce SCA risk. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have contributed to the progress of healthcare delivery through the application of computational statistics to medicine. ! ! Project Narrative: Although sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the industrial world’s leading cause of death, SCA prediction and prevention strategies remain limited. In this project, we contribute towards addressing the global burden of SCAs through the development of novel statistical/machine learning methods for SCA risk prediction and the design of mobile health (mHealth) interventions for risk reduction. While developed in the context of SCA, these methods will be applicable in many areas of medicine and public health. !",Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA): Prediction and Prevention,9986884,F30HL142131,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Information Technology', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'adaptive intervention', 'career', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'time use', 'tool', 'trial design', 'usability']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,35760,0.03955801368028107
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9997993,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'comorbidity', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support vector machine', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2020,515780,0.03331554683564096
"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser. The methods developed in this research proposal will not only further our understanding of DME but also generalize and enable future large-scale ophthalmic studies.",Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema,9995499,K23EY029246,"['Adopted', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Blindness', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundational Skills', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Centers', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Light Coagulation', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veterans', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Washington', 'automated algorithm', 'bevacizumab', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'diabetes management', 'diabetic', 'epidemiology study', 'hands-on learning', 'health administration', 'intravitreal injection', 'kidney dysfunction', 'laser photocoagulation', 'macula', 'macular edema', 'mortality', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapy outcome', 'traditional therapy', 'treatment optimization', 'unstructured data']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2020,238049,0.00981132485249269
"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",9850968,R01DK119860,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Caring', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'disorder subtype', 'elastography', 'hepatocellular injury', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'liver injury', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,442592,0.010804230054291568
"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome,10023944,R01MH119185,"['22q11.2', '3-Dimensional', 'Acoustic Rhinometry', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ear', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nasal cavity', 'Neurobiology', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Cortex', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oral cavity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Societies', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Work', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microdeletion', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory sulcus', 'precision medicine', 'psychotic symptoms', 'resilience', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,740401,0.0026322664699893377
"Factors associated with hospitalization, ICU use and death among vulnerable populations diagnosed with COVID-19 Project Summary. As of April 30, 2020, over 1 million individuals in the U.S. have been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with COVID-19 may develop various symptoms – while the majority of patients have mild symptoms, some require hospitalization, admissions to intensive care unit (ICU), and may die. To date, there is only limited knowledge on risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19. First, older adults have been found to have higher risks of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are more likely to be hospitalized or die. Studies have suggested that some underlying conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, or obesity, are associated with the severity of COVID-19. However, it is unknown to what extent these comorbidities explain the variation in the severity of COVID-19, whether older age is independently associated with the severity of COVID-19; and whether and how older age modifies the relationship between comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19. Second, it has been reported that black Americans experienced a higher rate of COVID-related hospitalization and were more likely to die of COVID- 19, compared to white Americans. However, it is unknown what may contribute to such racial difference – whether it is due to the differences in health conditions between blacks and whites, or due to the characteristics of the community where they reside in, or due to some other factors that are also associated with race. The objective of this study is to identify individual risk factors that are associated with the severity of COVID-19 (i.e. hospitalizations, ICU use and death), especially among older adults, and to understand reasons that may contribute to racial differences in COVID-19 severity. To achieve these goals, we will use the daily- updated national Veterans Affairs (VA) data, which contain rich individual-level information on veterans diagnosed with COVID-19. As of April 30, 2020, almost 9,000 veterans have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and about 500 had died, thus providing a large study cohort. This proposed study has two Specific Aims:1) To identify individual risk factors that are associated with COVID-19 related hospitalizations, ICU use and mortality, to understand the role of older age in COVID-19 severity, and to build a predictive model for COVID- 19 severity by machine learning; and 2) To examine reasons for racial differences in illness severity among veterans diagnosed with COVID-19: whether and how such difference is related to individual factors and community characteristics, especially socio-economic status. This study is innovative because it will be the first study to examine the role of multiple risk factors in the severity of COVID-19 by using national data with detailed individual-level information and machine learning algorithm; and it will be the first to examine the reasons, including the role of social determinants, for racial differences in COVID-19 severity. This proposed research is significant as it will help to identify patients with the highest-risk phenotypes, thus providing insights into disease prevention and resource allocation. Project Narrative: This proposed research aims to understand risks factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 (i.e. hospitalization, ICU use and death) and the role of older age in the severity of COVID-19; and to examine reasons leading to racial differences in the severity of COVID-19. This proposed research is highly relevant to public health because the findings from this study will help target prevention strategies and allocation of resources to high-risk populations and help fight this novel infectious disease.","Factors associated with hospitalization, ICU use and death among vulnerable populations diagnosed with COVID-19",10159581,RF1AG063811,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'African American', 'Age', 'COVID-19', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Virus', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'caucasian American', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'fighting', 'health administration', 'health difference', 'health service use', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel virus', 'parent grant', 'predictive modeling', 'racial difference', 'racial health disparity', 'social determinants', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'study population', 'success']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,RF1,2020,578879,-0.036882972565450305
"Finding Genomic Profiles of COVID-19 Phenotypes from the EHR Abstract: As the world searches for effective treatments and potential cures for the COVID-19 pandemic, the ability to consolidate data, insights, and expertise from many disparate sources will be key to fully understanding the patient outcomes of the infection. Key to facilitating this type of research is a cohesive and secure research environment that enables clinicians, researchers, data scientists, and technologists from multiple organizations to work together with a common goal of better understanding COVID-19 symptoms, associated risk factors, and successful therapies. Building upon faculty, staff and infrastructure already in place through the eMERGE IV Clinical Center at Mass General Brigham, we are proposing the creation of a COVID- 19 Biobank Portal to provide a foundation for building a truly collaborative environment that is compliant with patient privacy and offers a common set of bioinformatic tools and a standardized IT approach for the staging of data and analyses. We will do this by accomplishing the following three Specific Aims which supplement the parent grant’s Aim I which is: “Polygenic risks scores will allow us to stratify eMERGE participants based on genetic risk for common complex traits” which will focus in this supplement on risk factors for severity of COVID-19 illness in our biobank participants. We propose to build on our expertise to accomplish the specific aims: Aim 1: We will create a COVID-19 Centric Biobank Portal that allows general institutional use with proper research agreements in place where patient cohorts can be studied using easily assessable and transformed data and through which genomic samples can be obtained. Aim 2: Supplement the COVID-19 Biobank Portal with test results, phenotype risk factors, symptoms, and outcomes for COVID-19 which are derived from data in the electronic health record (EHR) by using natural language processing and computational phenotypes and by performing chart reviews to validate severity indices and clinical outcomes found in COVID-19 infected patients. Aim 3: Genetic data (array and sequence data) will be contributed to the eMERGE IV network and to the International l COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (https://covid19hg.org) such that data can be used to calculate polygenic risk scores (PRS) for genome-wide association studies of risk phenotypes and patient outcomes and polygenic risk scores (PRS) for COVID-19 outcomes in our dataset and in collaborations with others.

"Development and clinical validation of multimodal risk algorithms for predicting future internalizing psychopathology I am currently Assistant Professor and a licensed clinical psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Vermont. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator using novel strategies in developmental neuroimaging to study mood and anxiety symptomatology from birth to maturity. Although I have been trained in the analysis of longitudinal structural MRI, I require further training in the processing and analysis of state-of-the-art multiband neuroimaging data that allows for more sensitive measures of brain connectivity. I am also lacking expertise with regard to more sophisticated analytic methods for more fully leveraging large-sample multimodal datasets. Such approaches will enable me to move beyond conventional univariate statistical analyses and prepare me for future Big Data initiatives. During the proposed K08 period, my overarching goal is to develop expertise in the application of machine-learning approaches to multimodal data in order to characterize the most salient psychosocial and brain-based predictors of youth internalizing psychopathology. To achieve these goals, I am pursuing career development and training activities in the following areas: 1) assessment and characterization of psychosocial risk factors; 2) theory and implementation of Big Data methods, including machine learning algorithms and cross-validation strategies; 3) analysis of multiband multimodal brain imaging data using Human Connectome Project pipelines with the aim of more comprehensively assessing aspects of cortico-limbic connectivity; 4) independently running my own neuroimaging research study; and 5) developing and submitting a competitive R01 application. In order to obtain this expertise, I am proposing training activities at several institutions, including the University of Vermont, Harvard Medical School, McGill University, and Oregon Health and Science University. The research project in this K08 proposal aims to produce risk algorithms for a transdiagnostic dimension of psychopathology, using novel machine learning approaches to leverage two of the largest longitudinal neuroimaging samples in the world (IMAGEN and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study). These risk algorithms will subsequently undergo refinement using a new sample of clinic-referred youths that I will recruit from an outpatient psychiatric clinic in Vermont. As part of the project, I will also test the degree to which these algorithms predict treatment response. These data will be used as pilot data for my planned R01 application. Given the methods that I am proposing, this project will be able to detect complex non-linear interactions involving risk factors from a multitude of domains. As a result, this work will inform, and help to delineate, various etiological pathways that ultimately result in internalizing problems. Most importantly, this project could inform early identification and targeted intervention strategies during a critical period for the development of internalizing symptomatology. ! Project Narrative This study aims to produce risk algorithms for a transdiagnostic dimension of mood and anxiety psychopathology using novel machine learning approaches to leverage two of the largest longitudinal neuroimaging datasets in the world. These risk algorithms will subsequently undergo further refinement using a new sample of clinic-referred youths that the applicant will recruit from an outpatient psychiatric clinic. This project has the exciting potential to characterize early determinants of future internalizing problems, and set the stage for more individualized interventions and targeted prevention efforts.",Development and clinical validation of multimodal risk algorithms for predicting future internalizing psychopathology,10054828,K08MH121654,"['12 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Certification', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Family Process', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurobiology', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Problem Sets', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychologist', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'ROC Curve', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vermont', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'connectome', 'critical period', 'data analysis pipeline', 'early life stress', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'research study', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'tool', 'tractography']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2020,184535,-0.009512724951640805
"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,9836889,R01MH116969,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'algorithm development', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'kernel methods', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neural correlate', 'pleasure', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'socioeconomics', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2020,563046,0.02250107505404865
"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for evaluating angle closure patients despite its limited ability to quantify PACD severity and predict progression to PACG.

"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10010769,R44EY031202,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Antioxidants', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drusen', 'Ear', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fees', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Java', 'Lasers', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'New York', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sales', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Sun Exposure', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trademark', 'Treatment Cost', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Acuity', 'Vitamins', 'age related', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care costs', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'photobiomodulation', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'retinal imaging', 'rural area', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2020,585067,0.013930842264607661
"4/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, and (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will substantially advance our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders.

"Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study Project Summary In the U.S., approximately 840,000 Americans die from cardiovascular disease (CVD) each year. The prevalence of CVD is on the rise and widespread disparities in CVD exist across economic, racial, and ethnic groups. In order to address the rising prevalence of CVD and persistent disparities, there has been a shift in focus to public health strategies addressing cardiovascular health (CVH). CVH is a broader and more positive construct beyond the absence of CVD. Despite this recent focus on improving CVH, widespread disparities still exist. Social determinants of health (SDOH) may be important contributors to these continued disparities. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines SDOH as the “structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.” There has been limited work in studying how a diverse set of SDOH change over time and perform in the prediction of CVH. To address this need, we will identify patterns of SDOH exposure over time and determine if the addition of SDOH variables allows for better prediction of an individual's CVH status. The primary hypothesis is that a diverse set of SDOH will be associated with and improve the prediction of CVH, independent of baseline CVH and other covariates. To examine this hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) identify patterns of SDOH exposure up to age 50 and define exposure subgroups and 2) determine whether overall and domain-specific patterns of SDOH exposures from young adulthood to middle age, identified in Aim 1, are associated with and improve the prediction of CVH and its component metrics. We will utilize the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a prospective cohort study with detailed information on cardiovascular risk factors and disease in a geographically and racially diverse sample of young adults. In Aim 1, we will use a novel sequential pattern mining method to identify the associations among SDOH and determine the SDOH exposure patterns from baseline to age 50. The Aim 1 SDOH exposure definitions will be included as predictors of CVH at age 50 and beyond using supervised machine learning techniques. By including SDOH in predictive models, health services professionals and clinicians may have an improved understanding of patients at high-risk for low CVH and may better tailor social and clinical interventions to each patient's needs. If awarded, this fellowship will allow me to contribute novel research to the SDOH and cardiovascular health fields, gain competency in new research skills, and improve my writing and presentation skills. The completion of this project and training will prepare me for my long-term career goal of becoming an independent research scientist in an academic setting, studying SDOH and using data science and informatics tools to improve public health. Project Narrative The incorporation of social determinants of health (SDOH) in predictive models for cardiovascular health (CVH) may help health services professionals and clinicians in identifying patients at high-risk for low CVH. This has important public health implications because social and clinical interventions may be tailored to each patient's needs. This research may also help to identify which SDOH are predictive of CVH from young adulthood to middle age, allowing public health professionals to target specific SDOH through directed social, behavioral, and policy-related interventions.",Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study,9911103,F31HL151178,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Social Identification', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Writing', 'age group', 'base', 'biracial', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'cohort', 'fasting plasma glucose', 'good diet', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial difference', 'racial diversity', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F31,2020,40733,0.01597787585898888
"Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture Over 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the U.S. and up to 25% of hip-fracture patients die within a year of their injury. Despite the importance of this clinical problem, the diagnostic screening rate for osteoporosis is only 5% of the eligible population, and the sensitivity of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA, the clinical standard test for diagnosis, is only 50%. Therefore, most patients are not being screened diagnostically for osteoporosis, and for those who are, about half who will experience a hip fracture are missed. Given that the current empirical approach is inadequate, we propose to pursue a more mechanistic approach, combining state-of-the-art biomechanics and machine learning approaches. Biomechanically, the three etiological elements of hip fracture are fall risk, femoral strength, and femoral impact force. In this project, our overall goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how all three biomechanical etiological elements interact in the event of a hip fracture and from that, directly improve clinical fracture risk assessment through the use of a single predictive “Integral Biomechanical Risk (IBR)” parameter. In addition, we will also address the problem of low DXA screening rates by further developing our Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) technology. This test estimates the breaking strength of the femur using finite element analysis of routine clinical CT scans previously acquired for any medical reason, and represents an improvement compared to the use of BMD alone. Since millions of patients are scanned with CT each year, this approach could double screening rates if offered as an alternative to DXA. The proposed study will investigate this biomechanical approach in a large incident hip fracture, case-cohort study (3,000 patients with hip fracture, 6,000 without). This retrospective study will include patients seen at Kaiser Permanente who had an abdominal CT scan as part of medical care prior to any hip fracture; and have standard geriatric measurements in their electronic medical records, which we will use to estimate fall risk. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) utilize electronic medical record data and CT scans to obtain patient-specific measurements related to fall risk, femoral strength, and fall severity, and 2) combine the different elements of hip fracture etiology into the IBR parameter to test the hypothesis that this metric predicts hip fracture independent of age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity, and history of prior fracture and improves hip fracture prediction compared to the clinical standard (BMD with FRAX). Scientifically, a major novelty of this work is its use of contemporary machine learning algorithms to inform construction of a mechanistic model of the three etiological elements of hip fracture, which should better capture any interactions between these elements compared to a purely statistical-regression approach. In addition, the study cohort will be the largest and most diverse CT-based hip fracture cohort ever assembled. Importantly, positive results from this project would provide a compelling “second front” to DXA that could be quickly translated to widespread clinical practice, profoundly impacting osteoporosis care. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE More than half of individuals who experience hip fracture do not have osteoporosis as assessed by DXA. This project draws together the latest technological advances in CT-based finite element modeling and combines it into a probabilistic model of fracture risk that uses as inputs, data typically available in medical records. By going beyond BMD, the fracture risk prediction tool developed by this work aims to significantly improve clinical fracture risk assessment and substantially impact the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.",Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture,9886227,R01AR074958,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomechanics', 'Blinded', 'Bone Density', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip Fractures', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive treatment', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal CT', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'bone', 'bone strength', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'diagnostic screening', 'ductile', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fracture risk', 'high risk', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuromuscular', 'older patient', 'patient health information', 'screening', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'standing height', 'theories', 'tool']",NIAMS,"O.

"1/4 Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health factors, such as employment and educational attainment, can increase the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, as well as (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will generate new data in improving our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders.

"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) is a major concern after ACL reconstruction. This project will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction using a novel combination of mechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics.

"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, thus representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype. Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. Although individuals with SPD demonstrate marked temporal lobe abnormalities that resemble SZ, we hypothesize that relative “sparing” or “functional enhancement” in the frontal lobes (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), may protect these individuals from frank psychosis and the severe social and cognitive deficits typically observed in SZ. Studying SPD is powerful as antipsychotic medication and hospitalization confounds observed in SZ are not present. Moreover, there is no study examining neurobiological changes in the SZ-spectrum that incorporates individuals with SPD using a longitudinal design as proposed here. This novel approach will help disentangle potential risk and protective factors for psychosis in the SZ spectrum. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal MR imaging and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approaches in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry along a continuum from healthy controls (HCs) to SPD to SZ and examine changes in these measures in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition and functional outcome. We propose studying three groups (80 in each) of demographically matched and rigorously diagnosed individuals (age 18- 40): HCs (no Axis I or personality disorder), unmedicated individuals with SPD (and no Axis I disorder), and early-onset (first 2 years of illness) SZ patients at baseline, 9-, and 18-month follow-up. Measures assessing frontal and temporal lobe integrity include multimodal MR imaging (structural MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI with a nonverbal event related working-memory task; baseline and 18-months) and neuropsychological assessment (all three timepoints). We will utilize dynamic causal modeling to test competing neurobiological models involving abnormal frontotemporal connectivity in the SZ-spectrum and machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and clinical assessment data. We focus on three specific aims: (1) Investigate the longitudinal course of frontal-temporal lobe/circuitry abnormalities in the SZ-spectrum using multimodal MR imaging; (2) Investigate the longitudinal course of neurocognition, clinical, and functional outcome in the SZ spectrum; (3) Determine which factor or combination of factors differentiate groups in the SZ-spectrum to identify those that are associated with risk for and protection from SZ using machine learning. PROJECT NARRATIVE Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype that provides important information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis.

"Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions Project Summary/Abstract Atrial Fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and accounts for roughly 15% of all strokes in the United States. Many individuals may have undiagnosed AF whose arrhythmia does not prompt evaluation either because of minimal symptoms or brief episodes. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is highly effective at reducing stroke risk in patients with AF, but is only prescribed to individuals with recognized disease. Identifying subjects with undiagnosed AF is important so they may be treated with OAC and prevent strokes from occurring. This project will help advance our knowledge of screening patients for undiagnosed AF in the primary care setting by identifying patients at high risk of developing AF for targeted clinic and home-based screening strategies. Fundamental questions of who to target and how to implement a screening program in the United States remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic and content area training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To identify predictors of AF incidence from electronic health record structured and free-text data, 2) To develop and implement an electronic algorithm that improves upon existing models to identify patients at increased risk for AF in a primary care population, and 3) To implement and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of a clinic and home-based screening program to identify undiagnosed AF. This project aligns with several objectives of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Strategic Vision by implementing novel diagnostic tools to diagnose AF and prevent strokes, by optimizing clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease, and leveraging emerging opportunities in data science, through the use of natural language processing of text data in the electronic health record, to improve identification of patients at high risk for AF. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in cardiovascular disease and targeting populations for prevention of cardiovascular disease events. Career development activities include training in biomedical informatics, data mining and risk prediction, survey research design, implementation research, and cardiovascular disease pathophysiology and clinical management through formal coursework, clinical shadowing, as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will improve prediction of which patients are at the highest risk of developing AF, and evaluate how to use this risk information to implement an effective screening strategy in primary care. Pilot data from this award will lay the groundwork for a highly competitive application for NIH R01 funding. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke and the prevalence is estimated to increase from 5.2 million adults in the United States to more than 12 million by 2030, however, many additional individuals have undiagnosed disease. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, by 1) improving identification of patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation, and 2) targeting patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation in the primary care setting with an efficient strategy for clinic and home-based screening. This program will significantly increase knowledge of how to overcome the real-world issue of how to effectively and efficiently screen for atrial fibrillation in clinical practice.",Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions,9982695,K01HL148506,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Senior Scientist', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data registry', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient screening', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk minimization', 'screening', 'screening program', 'stroke risk', 'structured data', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2020,177770,0.016917410726098234
"Mentoring in patient-oriented atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular research PROJECT SUMMARY This application will provide the Principal Investigator, Dr. Alvaro Alonso, with protected time and other support to (1) accelerate a successful record of mentoring junior clinical investigators and graduate students engaged in patient-oriented cardiovascular research; (2) obtain additional training in omics, machine learning, and mentoring best-practices; and (3) advance Dr. Alonso's ongoing research on the risk factors and mechanisms contributing to the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). Mentoring activities will build upon the ongoing involvement of Dr. Alonso in several training programs at Emory University, including an NHLBI-funded multidisciplinary T32 training grant on cardiovascular health disparities, the research-track Cardiology fellowship program at the School of Medicine, and the Master of Public Health and PhD programs in epidemiology at the Rollins School of Public Health. Training will focus on cutting-edge methodological areas in rapid development, including integration of omic technologies and machine learning in patient-oriented research, as well as acquisition of skills in academic, research, and clinical mentoring. Finally, this award will support a research project that extends Dr. Alonso's ongoing work on understanding the factors influencing the development of the AF substrate, understanding AF pathophysiology, and preventing AF-related outcomes. The specific aims of this research are: (1) to identify novel AF phenotypes (phenogroups) using extensive clinical and multi-omic data (“phenomapping”), (2) to discover specific risk factors for the different AF phenogroups, and (3) to determine associations of AF phenogroups with selected endpoints (stroke, heart failure, mortality). These research aims will be carried out in the context of the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank, an ongoing prospective registry of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization in three Emory-affiliated hospitals currently including approximately 7,000 unique individuals with detailed phenotyping, clinical outcomes, and multi-omic markers. In summary, the activities proposed in this application will favorably impact Dr. Alonso's capabilities to conduct cutting-edge and innovative patient-oriented research on cardiovascular prevention and his ability to perform as a highly qualified mentor for junior clinicians pursuing research on clinical cardiovascular epidemiology and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite progress, atrial fibrillation, a common cardiac arrhythmia, remains a major public health program. This award will contribute to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of atrial fibrillation.

"2/5 CAPER Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment.

We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk.

"Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use ABSTRACT: The use of prescription amphetamines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has markedly increased in the last fifteen years, with the greatest increase in adolescents and young adults. In 2007, the FDA mandated changes to stimulant labels to warn of increases in psychosis and mania in patients without pre-existing conditions. Our multidisciplinary research team from Brigham and Women's Hospital and McLean Hospital recently published a landmark cohort study demonstrating an increased risk of psychotic episodes in new users of amphetamine compared to methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Alarmingly, the use of amphetamines increased four-fold over the study period (2004 – 2015). In addition, our data show that prescription amphetamine use has dramatically increased in patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder. Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate knowledge about prescriber-level factors, patient-level factors and disease states that potentiate the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines. Large-scale studies using real-world data are the only option to study the risk of infrequent and serious adverse outcomes. In Aim 1, using incident-user cohort study designs, we will utilize data from two national administrative claims databases to identify prescriber dosing strategies that increase the risk of first-episode psychosis in ~220,000 adolescents and adults with ADHD initiating amphetamines. We hypothesize that there will be a dose-dependent increase in the risk of psychosis. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify patient subgroups at heightened risk of psychosis/mania with prescription amphetamine use. To accomplish this goal, we will perform a case control study using electronic medical records (EMR) from McLean Hospital in ~1,650 patients hospitalized for an initial episode of psychosis or mania compared to ~3,300 controls with a first psychiatric hospitalization for reasons other than psychosis or mania. We will apply natural language processing to unstructured narrative notes to capture detailed patient data not available in claims data. We hypothesize that patients with a family history of psychiatric illness will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without a family history. We also hypothesize that patients with concurrent cannabis use will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without cannabis use. Aim 3 compares the risk of treatment-emergent mania in ~52,000 new users of amphetamine versus methylphenidate in a cohort study of patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, an urgent issue given the known risk of mania with stimulant use. Combined, these studies will provide actionable evidence to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines with the goal of mitigating the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription stimulants. The proposed research agenda aligns with NIMH Strategic Objective 3.3 “Striving for Prevention and Cure” on testing interventions in real-world practice settings to evaluate the impact of patient- and provider-level factors on clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE: In recent years, 6.1 million U.S. children and adolescents were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 16 million adults reported past-year use of prescription stimulants. The research team recently found an increased risk of psychosis in new users of prescription amphetamines compared to new users of prescription methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD, translating to potentially increased risk of psychosis for thousands of U.S. patients. Therefore, identifying patient subgroups and prescribing practices that increase the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines has enormous public health significance and will guide providers to avoid amphetamines in patients at highest risk, preventing future cases of psychosis and mania.",Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use,9939094,R01MH122427,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amphetamine Users', 'Amphetamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Boston', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immigration', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manic', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Modification', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'amphetamine use', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'first episode psychosis', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'patient subsets', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'stimulant use', 'treatment risk', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2020,746678,0.03572235261175532

"Clinical, Radiologic and Biochemical Factors Related to Diabetes Development after Acute Pancreatitis Abstract Nearly 40% of patients develop diabetes after an initial episode of acute pancreatitis (AP). Various studies have evaluated risk factors for the development of diabetes but they have shown inconsistent findings, suggesting methodologic shortcomings. The present proposal consists of three specific aims where we will attempt to determine the biochemical, radiologic and clinical factors related to the development of diabetes after AP. Aim 1: To identify autoantibodies associated with the progression of type 1 diabetes in patients after AP using a large human proteome array. Aim 2: To study the role of imaging, more specifically quantitative textural analysis to predict the development of type 1 diabetes after AP. Aim 3 is to build a machine learning model to predict type 1 diabetes after AP using patient-related risk factors, textural analysis on imaging and autoantibodies involved in disease progression. Our proposal will help us better understand diabetes after AP. Successful completion of this study has the potential to improve management for AP. Project Narrative Relevance to Public Health Statement Acute pancreatitis is increasing in incidence and can lead to diabetes in some patients. Diabetes is a morbid disease. We plan to study both established and novel risk factors for developing diabetes in patients with acute pancreatitis.","Clinical, Radiologic and Biochemical Factors Related to Diabetes Development after Acute Pancreatitis",10128083,U01DK127400,"['Acute', 'Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis', 'Address', 'Antibodies', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diabetes', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autologous Transplantation', 'Beta Cell', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes autoantibodies', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glucagon', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Total Pancreatectomy', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute pancreatitis', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical center', 'clinical risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'impaired glucose tolerance', 'improved', 'islet', 'macrovascular disease', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'radiomics', 'subcutaneous', 'systematic review']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,286563,0.02401104826014112
"A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors PROJECT ABSTRACT Advances in acute care have decreased short-term mortality of sepsis, resulting in an increasing number of survivors who experience significant morbidity and mortality. Recurrent infections account for 60% of hospital readmissions after sepsis and are an important cause of long-term mortality. Identifying sepsis survivors at risk for infections and understanding predisposing factors are therefore important first steps to develop personalized interventions to improve long-term outcomes. The overall research goal is to develop innovative targeted interventions to improve long-term outcomes after sepsis. This proposal focuses on identifying subgroups of sepsis survivors (phenotypes) at high risk for infection-related hospital readmissions and deaths. It is hypothesized that the combination of host factors, disease characteristics, and interventions prior to and during sepsis will identify distinct phenotypes that are captured by clinical data. These clinical phenotypes likely have distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms (e.g., immunosuppression), predispose to different outcomes (e.g., recurrent infections), and patients with the same phenotype may respond similarly to targeted interventions such as immunomodulation. In Aim 1, three nationally representative datasets of sepsis survivors will be assembled and analyzed by machine learning techniques to identify valid clinical sepsis phenotypes. In Aim 2, phenotypes at high-risk for infection-related readmissions and deaths at 6 months will be identified, and underlying biomarker profiles for these phenotypes analyzed. In Aim 3, these high-risk phenotypes will be used to conceptualize and simulate an adaptive platform trial designed to test the efficacy of three different immunomodulatory drugs. An adaptive trial design was chosen, because it can test multiple interventions simultaneously and reduces the chances of exposing patients to ineffective or harmful interventions. The research plan is augmented by expert mentoring and rigorous didactic training. Together, this will provide the candidate with essential career development skills in the science of precision medicine, including machine learning methodologies, Bayesian statistics, and innovate clinical trial design. This proposal has potentially groundbreaking implications for the future treatment of sepsis survivors, because it deviates from the current “one-size fits all” approach and attempts to create the framework for personalized interventions. This framework sets the stage for future independent investigator (RO1) applications evaluating personalized treatments in adaptive clinical trials, and will uniquely position the candidate as a future leader in the field of long-term outcomes after critical illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is important for public health because sepsis is a life-threatening infection that affects 30 million people worldwide each year. Long-term outcomes for patients who survive a hospital admission for sepsis are poor, and many patients develop new disabilities or worsening of preexisting health conditions. This proposal supports the NIH’s mission to enhance health and reduce illness and disability by trying to identify interventions for sepsis survivors at highest risk for poor outcomes.",A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors,9897562,K23GM132688,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Interleukin-7', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Sepsis', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'acute care', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'recurrent infection', 'response', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'trial design']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2020,187984,0.020466388700405982
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias. Results from this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations.",Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae,9972960,R01MH110453,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Attention', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Etiology', 'Explosion', 'Family', 'Fire - disasters', 'Future', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personality Disorders', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Poisoning', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Variant', 'Work', 'assault', 'base', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'member', 'novel', 'population based', 'post-trauma', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sexual assault', 'social', 'statistical and machine learning', 'time use', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,324735,0.036103251080321794
"Predictive modeling of peripartum depression ABSTRACT Psychiatric problems surrounding parturition affect both the mother’s health and her child’s developmental trajectory. Peripartum depression (PPD), referring to a depressive episode occurring during pregnancy or after childbirth, is both common and morbid. PPD has been implicated in various short and long term adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery and heightened risk for mental illness in the adult offspring. In extreme cases, PPD can lead to maternal suicide and/or infanticide. Although an estimated 760,000 American women (and children) suffer from PPD each year and screening for PPD has been recommended by the USPTF, no accurate screening tool is available to adequately identify women at risk of PPD. This novel study will capitalize on the rich clinical, demographic, and laboratory information in patients’ electronic medical reports (EMRs) to improve screening for PPD. We propose to implement advanced machine learning methods to build a model to optimize identification of women at risk for PPD. We we will adopt a psycho-social- biological approach of mental illness to prospectively explore the combined effect of various disease-related factors in improving the accuracy of PPD prediction. Our dataset will make use of a sample of 20,000 women who have been followed during their obstetrical care in two leading academic hospitals in Boston. We will gather information concerning socioeconomic factors, relevant obstetric factors, and mental and physical conditions in pregnancy and disease history, as derived from laboratory test results and the patient’s report. We expect our findings to advance scientific knowledge of women at risk for PPD. Our work may lead to the development of a screening protocol that is low-cost and easily performed by health providers in clinical settings. Early identification of women at risk could potentially allow targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence and morbidity of PPD in the US. This in turn could reduce treatment costs, avoid a potentially preventable disease, and improve the quality of care and health outcomes of mothers and their children. Our study accords with the NICD high priority area of research aimed at improving the health of women during and after pregnancy and improving pregnancy outcomes. The proposed project will further the NICHD mission that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that children achieve healthy and productive lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripartum depression (PDD) referring to the occurrence of depressive episode during pregnancy or following childbirth is a common and serious illness. While the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends universal screening for PPD, there is no accurate tool to predict women who would be at risk of suffering from PPD. The goal of this study is to test a machine learning predictive model of PPD using information in patients’ medical records to decrease PPD’s prevalence and ultimately prevent it.",Predictive modeling of peripartum depression,9958240,R03HD101724,"['Adopted', 'Adult Children', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Etiology', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Infanticide', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive service', 'Primigravidities', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Screening procedure', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Suicide', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Cost', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'antenatal', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'health of the mother', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obstetric care', 'patient health information', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'primipara', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'tool']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2020,84000,-0.0005596553625651894
"Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT The purpose of this K07 proposal is to provide Jeffrey Lee, MD, MAS with the protected time and resources to pursue the additional training needed to reach his long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator, focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence and mortality for CRC. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps (adenomas) and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. With limited data available in the literature to determine the appropriate timing and frequency of follow-up colonoscopy for patients after adenoma removal, recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance from our national guidelines have been imprecise at best. For example, the currently recommended range of 5-10 years for a surveillance colonoscopy for patients with a single adenoma covers a two-fold difference in exam frequency, with resultant two-fold impact on patient risk, cost, and colonoscopy capacity. To help optimize the timing of colonoscopic surveillance and guide appropriate utilization of this invasive and costly resource, stratification of CRC risk after colonoscopic polypectomy from a large community-based cohort with long-term follow-up is needed. Building on his prior work in CRC screening, Dr. Lee seeks to fill this knowledge gap by optimizing surveillance practices in post-polypectomy patients according to patient-, polyp-, and colonoscopy exam-related factors. Specifically, he will determine the long- term CRC risk in patients after colonoscopic polypectomy in a very large “real world” community-based population (Aim 1). He will also identify patient-, polyp-, and exam-related risk factors associated with incident CRC in these patients (Aim 2). Finally, he will develop a CRC risk prediction model that will identify post- polypectomy patients at high and low risk for developing subsequent CRC (Aim 3). To achieve these goals, Dr. Lee and his mentors have designed a career development plan for research and educational training to obtain: 1) knowledge and expertise in advanced epidemiologic methods for design and analysis of cohort studies; 2) knowledge in medical informatics methods; and 3) predictive modeling skills. To achieve the proposed research aims, Dr. Lee will leverage the rich electronic health records of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large community-based healthcare system, in which data on patient, physician, colonoscopy, pathology, and CRC status have been collected since 1994. In addition, Dr. Lee will use an established natural language processing tool to efficiently collect data and evaluate potential confounding variables from more than 600,000 colonoscopy reports in order to address one of the main practical challenges that have limited the feasibility of large-scale population-based studies. Thus, completion of these aims has the potential to improve prevention and early detection of CRC, impact current surveillance guidelines for post-polypectomy patients, and reduce overuse and underuse of surveillance colonoscopy. Importantly, this proposal is realistic and feasible within the award period and will allow Dr. Lee to continue to build research skills, generate preliminary data, create additional collaborative relationships, and compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K07 award will support and accelerate the career development activities of Dr. Lee and allow him to successfully launch into the next phase of his career as an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized controlled trials have shown that screening reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. However, screening has resulted in a growing cohort of patients with adenomatous polyps and little is known about effectively managing their post-polypectomy surveillance. Thus in this proposal, we will determine the long-term risk and risk factors of CRC after colonoscopic polypectomy, and develop a CRC risk prediction model to tailor surveillancein post- polypectomy patients using a large, community-based cohort.","Optimizing long-term post-polypectomy surveillance for colorectal cancer prevention using a prediction rule developed from a large, community-based cohort",9986702,K07CA212057,"['Address', 'Adenomatous Polyps', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Award', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Polypectomy', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scheme', 'Stratification', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Surveillance Program', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adenoma', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'premalignant', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'skills', 'surveillance strategy', 'tool']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K07,2020,171720,0.04166201725213926
"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",9917845,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Appalachia', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'social structure', 'sociodemographics', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2020,371411,-0.01632931682354043
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018 Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network 2018 Renewal ABSTRACT In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies. In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2018,9998934,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antioxidants', 'Apical', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Budesonide', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Chinese People', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Hepatic', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Oxidants', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'Taiwan', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vitamin E', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'bile salts', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'hepatotoxin', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outreach', 'pediatric patients', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'transcriptomics', 'transport inhibitor', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,344849,-0.0032807891622824194
"Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use Project Summary/Abstract  Insufficient knowledge of brain-based risk factors for problem cannabis use is a key barrier to identifying individuals at risk for cannabis-related harm and designing targeted prevention and early intervention approaches to promote positive development for persons at risk. The current proposal combines multiple, large- scale, neuroimaging datasets with novel densely-sampled fMRI data to identify a neuromarker of problem cannabis use and characterize its development prior to cannabis use onset, and in the context of current cannabis use in adolescence. We will apply a whole-brain, machine-learning method – connectome-based predictive modeling – to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use in a large sample of college students (Brain and Alcohol Research in College Students study; BARCS), and compare this network to canonical neural networks previously implicated in risk for cannabis use: frontoparietal, salience, and default mode networks. We will then examine the developmental trajectory of these cannabis risk networks in relation to other known risk factors for addiction prior to cannabis use onset in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, a nationally-representative sample of 11,875 children. We will examine whether individuals at high-risk for substance use problems (family history of substance use and exposure to early adversity) display a delay in the typical trajectory of network stabilization within cannabis risk networks. Finally, we will collect densely-sampled fMRI data (4 scans in 6 months) from 20 adolescents (age 15-17) who regularly use cannabis and 20 age- and sex-matched typically-developing adolescents. This study design will enable us to examine cannabis effects on short-term neural network dynamics and evaluate whether cannabis using adolescents are characterized by reduced stability of cannabis risk networks relative to their typically-developing peers. By combining multiple existing large-scale neuroimaging datasets with original, longitudinal, densely- sampled fMRI data, the proposed study design offers a unique opportunity to examine the interplay between neural mechanisms of risk for problem use and cannabis exposure effects on the developing adolescent brain and promises to yield important insights into the neural mechanisms of risk for problem cannabis use that can foster novel prevention and intervention initiatives to mitigate cannabis-related harms for individuals at high risk.  The current proposal also aims to provide Dr. Sarah Lichenstein with expert mentorship by Drs. Pearlson, Casey, Yip, Scheinost and Stevens to build the skills necessary to develop into an independent clinical scientist applying multimodal neuroimaging methods to study the pathophysiology of addiction. Dr. Lichenstein will pursue specialized training in studying cannabis effects on brain and behavior, big data science, and the conduct of research with adolescent participants. Furthermore, the collection of novel, densely-sampled, adolescent fMRI data will also provide Dr. Lichenstein with a rich and unique pilot dataset to support the submission of a R01 application by the end of the award period and facilitate her transition to an independent investigator. Project Narrative Cannabis use is extremely common and associated with clinically-significant negative outcomes for a subset of users, yet it is not currently possible to predict who is at highest risk for cannabis-related harms at the individual level. The current proposal aims to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use, and to characterize the development of this network both before and after cannabis use onset. Elucidating the neural basis of problem cannabis use will facilitate the development of novel prevention and early intervention efforts to mitigate potential cannabis-related harms for individuals at highest risk.",Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use,10038977,K08DA051667,"['18 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Cannabis', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Fostering', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol research', 'base', 'big-data science', 'brain behavior', 'brain research', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'design', 'early life adversity', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'high risk', 'illicit drug use', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana legalization', 'marijuana use', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'peer', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'skills', 'university student']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,191700,0.029180193208615052
"Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia Project Summary/Abstract: The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with transdisciplinary expertise in cancer epidemiology, biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation. The focused didactic training, mentorship, and experiential learning through research activities proposed in this award will facilitate the development of critical skills in the pursuit of knowledge to inform and improve cancer prevention and screening. The candidate's research is motivated by the recognition that type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at a 30-40% increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), and that anti-diabetic drugs may also alter CRC risk. Thus, this high-risk group presents an opportunity for targeted screening and early detection of CRC. Currently, CRC screening is based on age and family history, with no consideration for comorbidities, including T2DM. Building on her previous work in cancer epidemiology, the candidate seeks to determine the association between T2DM and risk of colorectal polyps: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity, individually reflecting different molecular pathways (Aim 1); and to examine the risk for colorectal polyps associated with anti-diabetic therapy: overall, by subtypes, and by lesion severity (Aim 2). These aims will be addressed by leveraging the rich resources of an existing colonoscopy- based cohort at the University of Washington Medical Center's (UWMC) Gastroenterology clinic established during 2003-2011. Demographics, select lifestyle factors, and detailed histopathology have been previously abstracted from UWMC's electronic medical records (EMR) database. The candidate proposes to extend this cohort through 2017 (N~38,000), and enhance it by linking existing data with diabetes-related variables from the EMR database using biomedical informatics (e.g., natural language processing, clinical text mining) to estimate the risk for colorectal neoplasia. Using these empirical estimates derived from Aims 1 and 2, the candidate will then build a microsimulation model projecting the risk for colorectal neoplasia in T2DM patients, accounting for their diabetes therapy. Alternative screening and treatment strategies, including altering the screening start-age, modifying diabetes treatment, or altering screening modality among T2DM patients, will be evaluated for their cost-effectiveness (Aim 3). This work may help inform targeted screening recommendations that could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening. The candidate has proposed a training and career development plan that builds upon her prior skills in cancer epidemiology to gain experience and proficiency in biomedical informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health economic modeling and evaluation, including cost-effectiveness approaches. The transdisciplinary mentorship team, comprised of national and international experts, will provide the necessary expertise to ensure the success of this proposal, as well as facilitate the candidate's transition into an independent translational investigator in the field of cancer prevention and screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to determine the link between clinically diagnosed type-2 diabetes mellitus, use of anti-diabetic medications, and risk of colorectal polyp subtypes, including differences by lesion severity. Evaluating the cost- effectiveness of CRC screening among persons with type-2 diabetes may help inform targeted screening recommendations, which could, in turn, lower the incidence and mortality of CRC among persons with T2DM, and improve the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening.","Diabetes, Medications and the Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Colorectal Neoplasia",9998913,K07CA222060,"['Accounting', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Award', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Models', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Family', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metformin', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Smoking History', 'Subgroup', 'Sulfonylurea Compounds', 'Testing', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer prevention', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'demographics', 'diabetes mellitus therapy', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'economic evaluation', 'experience', 'health economics', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'mortality', 'non-diabetic', 'personalized screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'skills', 'success', 'text searching', 'translational scientist', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K07,2020,158153,0.010956516712414363
"Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance PROJECT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a devastating syndrome that represents a leading cause of death, morbidity, and healthcare costs. Its impact is amplified by rising rates of antimicrobial resistance. Improving sepsis outcomes primarily results from prescribing timely antibiotics based on the estimated risk of multidrug resistance (MDR). Previous models grossly overestimated the MDR risk and exacerbated the escalating rates of antimicrobial resistance and excess mortality. The overall goal of this proposed K08 research is to identify common sepsis phenotypes that will enable better prescribing practices and standardized comparisons across hospitals, which will help practicing clinicians, researchers, healthcare institutions, and policy makers. These themes correlate with NIGMS's interest in finding innovative methods and leveraging big data to improve sepsis outcomes. Our three specific aims reflect these goals: (1) establish resistance thresholds for MDR Gram- negative bacilli (GNB) that cause sepsis, (2) assess the impact of sepsis definition on the performance of risk prediction models for MDR GNB, and (3) identify sepsis phenotypes at high risk for MDR GNB in a well-balanced cohort and assess the impact of case mix on risk prediction model performance. We will mathematically derive resistance thresholds that link population resistance rates to individual patient risk of death in sepsis caused by MDR GNB, assess factors that impact prediction performance, and incorporate rich clinical data from 15 hospitals in our healthcare system to identify stable common sepsis phenotypes. Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has training in Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine and experience in antimicrobial resistance in critically ill patients. This proposal will build on her clinical work and previous research experience in finding innovative methods to solve challenging problems at the intersection of infectious diseases and critical care medicine. Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has six career objectives: (1) pursue advanced training in clinical epidemiology; (2) acquire skills in advanced linear regression and multilevel modeling; (3) learn supervised machine learning methods; (4) acquire skills in big data management in healthcare and methods to handle missing data; (5) improve scientific communication, grantsmanship, and leadership, and (6) participate in training in the responsible conduct of research. She will achieve these goals through didactic coursework, hands-on research experience, and active mentoring from experts in Infectious Diseases, Critical Care Medicine, and applied clinical informatics. She will continue to develop innovative methods to mitigate the antimicrobial resistance crisis, especially in critically ill patients, and become an analytics translator at the intersection of clinical medicine and clinical applied informatics. The fertile research environment at Washington University in St. Louis, the experienced mentorship team, and a well-crafted career development plan will enable Dr. Vazquez Guillamet to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independently funded clinician-investigator utilizing big data to develop applications for risk prediction, surveillance, and outcome comparisons in antimicrobial resistance and sepsis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The significant burden of sepsis augmented by the escalating rates of antimicrobial resistance has incited many national performance improvement initiatives. Research efforts have focused on predicting patients at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant pathogens but existing models have led to risk overestimation thus promoting indiscriminate antimicrobial use and further fueling the emergence of resistance. The candidate, Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has focused on innovative ways to assess the impact of antimicrobial resistance and to develop generalizable useful risk prediction models. The current proposed research expands her previous work with the overall goal to develop clinical decision support tools that will improve antibiotic prescribing practices and will allow valid, case-mix adjusted comparisons across hospitals in terms of resistance prevalence rates and antimicrobial use.",Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance,10106044,K08GM140310,"['American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Bacillus', 'Big Data', 'Case Mixes', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Empiricism', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Excess Mortality', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'attributable mortality', 'base', 'big data management', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'combat', 'experience', 'hands on research', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'personalized risk prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'risk prediction model', 'septic patients', 'skills', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,167942,0.004775398285828403
"Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches Project Summary  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, affecting every 200-1000 people, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria. FH leads to lifetime raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a high risk for premature atherosclerosis and downstream coronary heart disease. FH is designated as Tier 1 disease by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, notably one of only three such diseases, because it is common, is associated with a high risk of premature illness, and is treatable with lifestyle or medications. Great uncertainty exists about the optimal approach to FH screening, which is reflected in conflicting recommendations in national screening guidelines.  We propose to synthesize high quality data from national surveys and population-based cohort studies in a health policy computer simulation model comparing the health and economic value of different FH screening strategies. This study will prioritize the optimal approaches to FH screening in the U.S. population, identifying optimal initial screening age and defining the role of genetic testing in screening.  We have assembled a team of experts in pediatric preventive cardiology, decision analysis, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, population genetics, biostatistics, health economic evaluation, and computer simulation modeling in order to evaluate and compare different FH screening strategies in children and adults. We aim to use this expertise and these methods in order to:   Quantify diagnostic yield, clinical effectiveness, and economic value of universal FH phenotype  screening in childhood or adulthood, and the added value of FH genotype screening   Compare universal FH screening to the alternatives of using family history or a Big Data-based  algorithm to direct targeted screening limited to children and adults with possible FH diagnosis   Quantify the health and economic value of cascade screening families of FH cases  We hypothesize that FH screening in childhood will be the highest value screening strategy in the U.S. population, and that genetic testing will improve diagnosis and treatment decisions most in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., borderline high cholesterol or absent family history). We hypothesize that a machine-learning algorithm will avoid the costs and complexity of universal screening, while yielding a similar case yield, as long as cholesterol testing is sufficiently common in children.  This study will identify the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population and the most influential data based on current knowledge and set the stage for efficiently designed clinical trials of FH screening. This study will be a test case for the concept of a “precision” population health approach to screening for genetically-determined diseases in the general population. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by lifetime elevated cholesterol, which, if uncontrolled, is associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conflicting current national guidelines highlight that the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population is controversial: it is unclear if screening should start in childhood or adulthood, or if it should include genetic testing. We propose to synthesize data from national surveys, high quality cohort studies, and clinical trials of cholesterol lowering interventions in a lifetime cardiovascular disease risk computer simulation model to project the life time health impact of different FH screening approaches and identify optimal screening strategies in children and adults.","Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches",9883835,R01HL141823,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coronary heart disease', 'County', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Policy', 'Hepatocyte', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Low Prevalence', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proxy', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'economic evaluation', 'economic value', 'genetic testing', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'models and simulation', 'pediatric patients', 'population based', 'population health', 'premature', 'premature atherosclerosis', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,804498,0.0044127565032547715
"EHR-based Genomic Risk Assessment and Management for Diverse Populations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recently, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide evidence for a substantial polygenic contribution to the risk of many common complex diseases. However, most of these studies were performed in Europeans, and new data and methods are necessary to tailor polygenic risk prediction to non-Europeans, to ensure that genomic stratification does not further exacerbate health disparities. The overarching goal of the eMERGE-IV network is to leverage genetic and electronic health record (EHR) data for diverse populations to design, validate and test the clinical utility of ancestry-tailored polygenic risk scores for common diseases. As a current member of the eMERGE network, Columbia University has significantly advanced its goals, having recruited over 2,500 diverse patients for sequencing and return of actionable findings, leading the effort to transition the network to the OMOP Common Data Model to improve the efficiency, accuracy, reproducibility and portability of electronic phenotypes, and contributing a widely-adopted XML parser for structuring genetic test reports. Since our last application, the Columbia Precision Medicine Initiative has also grown and now includes participation in several national initiatives, such as the All-of-Us program, in which we have demonstrated our ability to rapidly recruit patients under-represented in biomedical research. Our scientific expertise combined with our strong tradition of patient-centered research and community engagement in a socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse community of Northern Manhattan, positions us to successfully contribute as the Enhanced Diversity Clinical Site of the eEMERGE-IV network. We will leverage our prior experience with eMERGE, scientific expertise, and knowledge gained from participation in other national precision medicine initiatives to develop, optimize, validate and disseminate ancestry-tailored genomic risk assessment and clinical management tools. In Aim 1, we will continue to advance electronic phenotyping by contributing sharable natural language processing tools for converting clinical text into OMOP-based discrete data and facilitating phenotype interoperability. In Aim 2, we will develop and optimize accurate ancestry-tailored genome-wide polygenic predictors, integrate them with clinical risk predictions, and test their performance in diverse populations. In Aim 3, we will investigate ELSI issues related to the return of health risk predictions to diverse patients by ascertaining patients’, clinicians’, and IRB members’ views through focus groups. In Aim 4, we will develop portable EHR plug-ins to facilitate prospective risk communication and management using integrated genomic data, family history, and clinical data. In Aim 5, we will recruit 2,500 diverse patients and use a randomized controlled trial design to assess the impact of return of genomic prediction on the accuracy of risk perception, health surveillance, and risk reducing measures. This proposal will address major knowledge gaps in genetic risk assessment for diverse populations, and the solutions and knowledge gained will be broadly applicable to precision medicine for common complex traits across many clinical specialties. PROJECT NARRATIVE Advances in precision medicine are making it increasingly possible to tailor healthcare decisions based on the individual patient’s genomic risk profile. However, large-scale validation studies of risk prediction accuracy and its clinical utility are severely lacking in diverse populations.

"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988.

"Direct sub-second measurement of neuromodulator signaling during risky decision-making PROJECT SUMMARY Much work in decision neuroscience has been predicated on the hypothesis that dopaminergic signaling plays a critical role in value representations and their updating, and recent work has linked abnormalities in such value representations to specific features of psychiatric illness (e.g., anhedonia in major depression). However, despite the fundamental role that risk plays in evaluating choice options as well as the role sensitivity to risk plays in psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders at one extreme and health risk behaviors like substance use at another other, an understanding of the neurobiology of risk remains elusive. Indirect evidence from pharmacological studies have suggested both serotoninergic and noradrengergic signaling may play roles in representations of risk; however, direct measurement of serotonin or norepinephrine signaling during risky choice has yet to be examined in humans. Recent advances by MPI Montague’s group allow the unprecedented ability to track neuromodulator responses with high temporal resolution and chemical specificity. Specifically, MPI Montague’s team is able to directly and simultaneously measure dopamine and serotonin responses in awake humans with the temporal resolution (~ 1 ms) required to examine the relationship of neuromodulator release with decision-making processes. For signal identification and extraction, the recording method uses machine-learning algorithms (elastic net regression) combined with electrochemistry using only off-the shelf hardware and software. The product of this ‘elastic net electrochemistry’ is recordings of in vivo neuromodulator fluctuations at sub-second resolution. This application merges the decision neuroscience expertise of MPI King-Casas with these advances of MPI Montague to directly examine serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic functioning during risky choice. To achieve this goal, we will record neuromodulator responses in participants with medication-resistant epilepsy who already have intracranial depth electrodes in place for phase-II monitoring. Depth electrodes will be implanted by our neurosurgery colleagues at Virginia Tech’s medical affiliate Carilion Clinic (Carilion Clinic PI: Witcher). During recording, participants will perform i) a risk elicitation task (Holt & Laury type task) and ii) a reward learning task (multi-arm bandit task) that have been shown by our group and others both to reliably evoke neural responses associated with risk and representations as they are monitored in a standard (i.e., non-surgical) hospital suite.

PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the fundamental role that risk plays in evaluating choice options as well as the role sensitivity to risk plays in psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders at one extreme and health risk behaviors like substance use at another other, an understanding of the neurobiology of risk remains elusive.

"Administrative Supplement to Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project focuses on human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife, with an emphasis on factors that moderate and mediate brain-to- risk relationships. The Program Project applies integrative, multi-level and multi-method approaches in community samples of midlife men and women to understand brain phenotypes for CVD risk.

"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief.

"Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data ABSTRACT Since early January 2020, our interdisciplinary research team has conducted several studies to elucidate the emerging threat of COVID-19 and support public health responses throughout the United States, resulting in peer-reviewed publications, online COVID-19 forecasting tools, and extensive engagement with city, state and national decision makers. In our collaboration with the CDC to develop a national modeling resource for pandemic preparedness, we had recently developed a national model for evaluating multi-layered intervention strategies to contain and mitigate outbreaks in US cities. We adapted the model to COVID-19 by incorporating the latest estimates for age- and risk-group specific rates of transmission, disease progression, asymptomatic infections, and severity (including risks of hospitalization, critical care, ventilation and death). The model is designed to flexibly incorporate combinations of social distancing, contact tracing-isolation, antiviral prophylaxis and treatment, as well as vaccination strategies. Our Supplementary Aims propose to build a more granular and data-driven model of COVID-19 to elucidate the transmission, identify high-risk populations, surveillance targets and effective control of this and future epidemics within US cities. Aim S1: Focusing initially on the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan area in Texas, we will apply these models to improve real-time risk assessments and optimize the timing and extent of layered social distancing measures. Aim S2: We will rapidly evaluate strategies for rolling out antiviral prophylaxis and therapy based on clinical trial data. Aim S3: We will develop user interfaces for our Austin and national models to support both scientific research and public health efforts to mitigate COVID-19 and plan for future pandemic threats. These Aims are synergistic with Specific Aim 2 of our parent grant (R01 AI151176-01), in which we are developing high-resolution models of viral transmission to improve the early detection and control of anomalous respiratory viruses, particularly in at risk populations. NARRATIVE Our Supplementary Aims will accelerate the development of a flexible and granular model of COVID-19 emergence, transmission and control within US cities. Leveraging unprecedented data and a high level engagement with city and state leadership in the Austin-Round Rock MSA and Texas, we will rapidly improve our existing models to evaluate strategies for real-time surveillance and multifaceted interventions including non-pharmaceutical measures (eg, adaptive social distancing and cocooning of high risk populations) as well as future antiviral drugs to mitigate COVID-19. Finally, we will develop user-friendly interfaces for our models to support research and public health decision making for COVID-19 and future pandemic threats.","Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data",10150283,R01AI151176,"['Age', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'COVID-19', 'Categories', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Contact Tracing', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Surveillance', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Social Distance', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United States', 'Update', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Visualization', 'austin', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'multi-component intervention', 'pandemic disease', 'pandemic preparedness', 'parent grant', 'prevent', 'respiratory virus', 'response', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly', 'vaccination strategy', 'ventilation', 'viral transmission']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,387199,0.025182347551184106
"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and associated with significant impairment and mortality. Rates of depression begin to rise rapidly in early-mid adolescence and peak in early adulthood. This project seeks to identify early antecedents and risk factors for the onset of depressive disorders and to understand the processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically signficant psychopathology.

"Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes Project Summary Motor vehicle crashes lead causes of adolescent mortality, making this a major health threat facing US adolescents. Given that 95.6% of novice driver crashes are due to driver error, improved skill should reduce crash incidence. Research supports this: novice driver crash rates peak immediately following licensure and decline steeply with experience gained over the months following licensure. However, it is not known which critical driving skill deficits present at licensure predict crashes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop interventions prior to licensure that can lead to the safest independent driving post licensure. With this R21 project, we will identify deficits in driving skills that are (a) associated with major predictors of early crash risk (age at licensure and sex) and that (b) can predict differences in crash rates within the first year of independent licensure. We will leverage our exclusive access to an innovative, newly available data source for young driver research. To enable study of safety critical driving skill deficits in novice drivers, results from a new (as of July 2017) virtual driving test (VDT) - developed by the PI, adopted by the State of Ohio and delivered immediately prior to the on-road licensing examination - will be linked to Ohio licensing and crash data. We propose these aims: Aim 1: identify skill clusters using multivariate clustering, regression and machine learning techniques to test the hypothesis that these clusters are related to age at licensure, sex, and time spent in the learner period; Aim 2a: use data on driving skills linked with reported crash data in Ohio to determine whether the skill clusters identified in Aim 1 are associated with crash risk; and Aim 2b: determine if those skill clusters from Aim1 are predictive of crashes in rural teen drivers. With a large sample of new driver applicants (>25,000), this study will examine, for the first time, differences in skill, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will create a normative dataset of novice driver skills; classify skill deficits by age, sex and time in learner period; and quantify the relationship between skill deficits and crash rates during the first 2 months of licensure (when crash rates are highest for young drivers) and the following 10 months as experience accumulates. If the use of the VDT proves successful in predicting crash risk, we will be able to identify novice drivers with elevated crash risk before granting a license. This R21 will enable the following lines of research: (1) Develop new interventions that address skill deficits through training, individualized to the needs of the novice driver (in partnership with Ohio). (2) Develop or adapt advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or self-driving vehicle technology to mitigate identified skill deficits (as part of Dr. Winston’s National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center). (3) Conduct a prospective study (R01) of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk. Narrative We will identify safety-critical driving skill deficits immediately prior to licensure that predict crashes, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will leverage exclusive access to newly available data on >25,000 novice drivers: state licensing and crash data linked to results from a new (as of July 2017), well-validated virtual driving test that identifies driving skill deficits (adopted by Ohio). If this R21 finds the VDT successful in predicting crash risk, we plan to: (1) conduct a future study of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk and (2) develop new interventions (training and vehicle technology) to address this risk.","Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes",10000116,R21HD099635,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industry', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Licensure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Police', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vehicle crash', 'Young driver', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'design', 'driving skills', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prospective', 'safety study', 'sex', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suburb', 'virtual']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2020,210334,0.026133596613904058
"LEVERAGING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITHIN SOCIAL NETWORKS TO MAXIMIZE DRUG ANDALCOHOL TREATMENT EFFICACY AND RELAPSE PREVENTION PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sober Grid™ has developed a smartphone-based mobile application currently in use by over 120,000 individuals worldwide who are in, or seeking, recovery from drug and alcohol addiction. The “Grid”, as it is known, is a mobile-based, social recovery community providing rapid context- specific peer support, efficient help seeking, motivational enhancement exercises, and member ratings of support content – all aimed to prevent relapse. The overarching goal of this phase II project is to extend the current capabilities of the Sober Grid app to achieve a comprehensive social recovery support app featuring intelligent, context appropriate resource matching and 24/7 rapid response peer-coaching that is effective in reducing disordered substance use and is cost effective. We hypothesize that providing this functionality to high-risk members will be acceptable, feasible, increase access to and engagement with resources, and have a positive effect in increasing time to relapse and days of consecutive abstinence. The company’s priority commercial goal is to leverage the insights gained from its large database of information and behaviors recorded in its existing addiction recovery-focused social network, combined with its recently completed SBIR phase I work, to identify users at risk for relapse and deliver tailored lay and professional peer support, telehealth, and provider interventions prompted by near real-time automated risk indicators built into an Enhanced Sober Grid (ESG) solution. The specific goals of this proposed phase II project include: (1) implementing the relapse risk scoring algorithm successfully developed in phase I in a production environment, (2) developing a ML resource relevancy matching algorithm, and (3) using this system to pilot test the feasibility and acceptability as well as to estimate the effect on abstinence of providing peer-coaching and resource information to a national sample of Sober Grid members in recovery from non- alcohol/nicotine substances who are predicted to be at high risk for relapse. We will accomplish our objectives by: (Aim 1) Implementing an accurate, near real-time production risk prediction system; (Aim 2) Developing an enhanced, in-app substance-addiction recovery resource locator; and, (Aim 3) Determining the feasibility, acceptability and estimating the effect size of the proposed ESG among high relapse-risk participants in recovery from opioid, stimulant, or cannabis use. The expected impact of this project is to substantially enhance Sober Grid's ability to deliver effective and timely interventions to the right individuals, at the right time – including those high-need and underserved populations that would otherwise lack access to care and draw considerable resources from the healthcare system. This capability holds the promise to reduce drug and alcohol relapse and the associated negative health impacts at both an individual and societal level while reducing the total cost of providing treatment services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sober Grid is combining near real-time risk prediction with automated phone-app messaging, peer-coaching, and resource visibility and transparency in order to dramatically improve support for recovery from substance abuse. The strategy is to provide continuously available responsive connection and support with simple and familiar ways to search, filter, sort, identify, and review/rate resource options in order to lower overall relapse rates within the population, enabling Sober Grid users to achieve improved health outcomes and institutional payers to reduce the total cost of achieving those outcomes. Over time, the innovations resulting from this project will significantly reduce costs for individuals, public and private payers, the healthcare system, and society at large.",LEVERAGING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITHIN SOCIAL NETWORKS TO MAXIMIZE DRUG ANDALCOHOL TREATMENT EFFICACY AND RELAPSE PREVENTION,9897501,R44DA044062,"['Abstinence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Android', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug usage', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality Traits', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Published Comment', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Stream', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Underserved Population', 'Work', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'alcohol relapse', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'drug relapse', 'effective therapy', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'marijuana use', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'member', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'peer', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'phase 2 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'prevent', 'provider intervention', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sobriety', 'social', 'social media', 'stimulant use', 'success', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services']",NIDA,"SOBER GRID, INC.",R44,2020,471700,-0.013750769864800704
"Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous, life-threatening condition defined by poor oxygenation and bilateral pulmonary edema that carries a mortality rate >40% in most studies. Every ARDS drug trial to date has failed, perhaps because the clinical criteria defining ARDS include a substantial subset of low-risk patients. Clinical scoring systems poorly predict which ARDS patients will develop prolonged respiratory failure and are at increased risk of death.  Molecular profiling of pulmonary edema fluid could serve as a window on the alveolar microenvironment, enabling identification of high-risk patients. Pulmonary edema directly reflects lung pathobiology including loss of barrier integrity, inflammation, and epithelial damage. Unfortunately, free-flowing pulmonary edema has limited clinical utility because it can only be captured in a minority of patients. Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema is now possible in every patient with ARDS because of two critical innovations. First, we discovered that edema fluid condensing in the HME (heat and moisture exchanger) filter of the ventilator circuit, usually discarded as trash, closely reflects free-flowing edema. Second, we developed a non-targeted metabolomic fingerprinting method using mass spectroscopy that characterizes molecular components in trace quantities of fluid. Together, these innovations make it possible to test the central hypothesis that molecular features of edema fluid reflect pathobiology and enable ARDS risk stratification.  To address the prognostic enrichment potential of HME edema fluid, 300 early ARDS patients will be recruited at 3 US centers, with protocolized HME edema fluid collection. Aim 1 is to study whether high HME edema fluid total protein and lung-injury specific proteins predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. Aim 2 is to test whether hypermetabolic edema fluid and inflammatory lipids predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. In Aim 3, LASSO machine learning will be used to integrate all proteomic and metabolomic edema features into a prolonged mechanical ventilation classifier. The robustness of the classifier will be assessed by measuring whether it adds prognostic value to clinical ARDS severity scores, identifying how well key molecular features are reflected in plasma, and testing for replication in an independent cohort.  The goal of these studies is to examine to what extent a novel and readily available lung-specific sample, obtained early in the course of ARDS, reflects biology and can predict ARDS outcomes, thus offering prognostic enrichment for future clinical trials. Successful completion of the Specific Aims offers the potential for a much-needed classification scheme to better refine, understand, and therapeutically-target ARDS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a common, life-threatening condition with no approved drug treatments. Pulmonary edema is a cardinal feature of ARDS and is mirrored closely by edema fluid collected passively in the Heat Moisture Exchanger (HME) filter; thus HME filter edema provides a novel and completely non-invasive window to the alveolar microenvironment. This proposal seeks to understand whether molecular characteristics of HME filter edema predict prolonged respiratory failure and could facilitate enrollment of high-risk patients into ARDS clinical trials.",Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung,9945838,R01HL152083,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bilateral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Electrons', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Ventilator', 'alveolar epithelium', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'epithelial injury', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'ionization', 'lung injury', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'receptor for advanced glycation endproducts', 'recruit', 'secondary outcome', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,575013,-0.03499191094984751
"Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 mo is considered the optimal form of nutrition for most newborns, yet many women experience substantial roadblocks in meeting this goal. One of the most common reason for  lactation cessation is mastitis (inflammation of the breast). Mastitis is also a significant concern for the US dairy industry because, not only does it represent a significant challenge to animal welfare, but it also decreases milk production and is the most common reason animals are treated with antibiotics. Despite decades of research, mastitis prevention and treatment are poorly understood in both species. One reason for this is that, although mastitis has historically been attributed to the presence of bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, this dogma is now known to be incorrect. Modern advances in the use of DNA sequencing (rather than needing to grow bacteria in culture media) have resulted in a paradigm shift in this regard such that researchers now know that all milk produced by both healthy and mastitic cows and women contains a rich community of microbes. Experts now believe that a dysbiosis in these microbes or a shift in their metabolism causes mammary  inflammation. Consequently, we must now re-examine everything we thought we knew about the etiology and risk factors for this disease. Fundamental to filling this research gap is the rigorous characterization of the  microbiome in milk produced by healthy and mastitic women and cows; and identification of microbial community  “fingerprints” and metabolomic modifiers, thereof, that alter risk of mammary inflammation. In addition,  understanding the similarities and dissimilarities in mammary inflammation between cows and women will help  researchers understand whether the former can be used as a model for the latter (and vice versa). The overall objectives for this project are to 1) compare and contrast the milk microbiome, its functionality, immune  parameters, and inflammatory markers in healthy and mastitic women and cows, and 2) identify milk microbial  profiles and their functionality related to risk for mammary inflammation. Our central hypotheses are that  1) mammary inflammation in both species is associated with shifts in microbes and their function, concentrations of selected markers of immunity and mammary inflammation, and that 2) there exist detectable milk microbiome patterns (or functions) that predispose some women and cows to increased risk of inflammation, and these patterns are related to (and perhaps modified by) environmental and behavioral parameters, some of which are currently considered risk factors for mastitis. To test these hypotheses, we will compare healthy and mastitic cows and women (case-control design) during the first 6 wk postpartum (longitudinal, repeated-measures  design during a high-risk period in both species). Importantly, we will utilize a multi-omics approach and machine learning to understand complex relationships within and between species. The results of this work will lead to better understanding of how the microbiology of the lactating mammary gland is related to mammary  inflammation and will lay the groundwork for future studies to determine how this disease can be prevented and treated. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inflammation of the mammary gland (mastitis) is the leading cause for cessation of breastfeeding, considered the optimal form of nutrition for almost all newborns worldwide, and a major animal welfare and economic  burden for the dairy industry. Mastitis has been attributed to bacterial pathogens in the mammary gland, but new evidence demonstrates that all milk (healthy and mastitic) contains a community of microbes. Understanding the bacterial community in milk, and its function, with related host immune response will lead to a reduction in the risk of inflammation in dairy cows and women, support breastfeeding, and promote optimal health in  mothers and infants.",Mammary and milk microbiomes and metabolomes - Understanding early variation and impacts on risk for mammary inflammation and mastitis,9970508,R01HD092297,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cattle', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Culture Media', 'DNA sequencing', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Etiology', 'Exclusive Breastfeeding', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Industry', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Lactation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammary gland', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'case control', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'high risk', 'inflammatory marker', 'inflammatory milieu', 'macromolecule', 'mastitis', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'milk microbiome', 'milk production', 'multiple omics', 'nutrition', 'offspring', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'protein metabolite', 'virtual']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO,R01,2020,428679,0.01936356466735721
"Preventing antimicrobial resistance and infections in hospitalized neonates in low resource settings Project Summary/Abstract Annually, 2.5 million babies die within the first four weeks of life, nearly a quarter due to infectious causes. Newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) are especially vulnerable, due to such factors as prematurity, an immature immune system, and need for life-sustaining invasive procedures and devices. In low and middle income countries (LMIC), an increasing number of NICUs care for premature and critically ill newborns. Healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (HA-BSI) in LMIC are more common due to inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) and more difficult to treat due to high rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Previous research in this setting focuses primarily on outbreak investigations and does not adequately describe risk factors for HA-BSI. Healthcare facilities lack effective tools to assess maternal and neonatal IPC and create improvement strategies. Preliminary data from the applicant's ongoing prospective cohort study that has enrolled over 6600 neonates in three NICUs in Pune, India, reinforces the high incidence of HA-BSI in this setting with a rate of 7.6 per 1000 patient-days, as well as high rates of AMR. Among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, the most common BSI pathogen, 96% are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and 38% to carbapenems. Among neonates with BSI, mortality is 22%. Within the framework of this study, the following are proposed: (1) To identify modifiable risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU; (2) To develop a model for predicting infection with carbapenem-resistant organisms (CRO); and (3) To develop and pilot a novel tool to assess IPC practices in the NICU and Labor & Delivery. Identifying risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU will promote development of targeted IPC strategies. Creation of a prediction model using a decision tree algorithm will help identify babies at highest risk of CRO infections. Such a model can support NICU clinicians in selecting the right antibiotics when infection is suspected, reducing time to appropriate therapy and decreasing unnecessary use of last resort antibiotics such as colistin. Development of an IPC assessment tool that incorporates human factors engineering (HFE) principles will enable healthcare facilities to optimize IPC and reduce risk of hospital-acquired infections and associated mortality. This mentored research will train the applicant in advanced epidemiologic methods and application of IPC in LMIC. The applicant is a neonatologist at Johns Hopkins University committed to patient-oriented research in resource-limited settings. Her long-term goals are to become a leader in neonatal IPC in low resource settings and devise interventions to reduce global burden of HA-BSI and associated mortality. This K23 will facilitate skill development in longitudinal data analysis, prediction models, survey development, HFE, and qualitative data analysis. Training will include formal coursework, supervised data analysis, and mentorship by a team with expertise in infectious diseases, IPC, biostatistics, epidemiology, patient safety, and HFE. Collectively, the activities of this K23 will provide a pathway to an independent career as a clinical investigator with expertise in healthcare epidemiology and IPC in low resource settings. Project Narrative Worldwide, more than 600,000 newborns die from infections each year. India has one of the highest burdens of newborn deaths due to bacterial infections, which are commonly resistant to antibiotics. In this study, I will identify risk factors for newborn bloodstream infections, develop a method for predicting antibiotic-resistant infections, and create an infection prevention survey to reduce risk of infections in hospitalized babies in Indian Neonatal Intensive Care Units.",Preventing antimicrobial resistance and infections in hospitalized neonates in low resource settings,9871398,K23HD100594,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Assessment tool', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Carbapenems', 'Caring', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colistin', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Hand', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hygiene', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'India', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resort', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'biobank', 'carbapenem resistance', 'career', 'classification trees', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'critically ill newborn', 'health care model', 'healthcare-associated infections', 'high risk', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'infection risk', 'low and middle-income countries', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neonatal care', 'neonatal death', 'neonatal infection', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rectal', 'regression trees', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,170696,0.03370836403318684
"Individual differences in dementia spousal caregiver burden: A biobehavioral approach revision Abstract The outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 virus has exasperated the vulnerability of dementia spousal caregivers, as well as those with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias. SARS-Cov-2 is a highly contagious virus that can cause severe respiratory problems and even death. Older adults and people of all ages with underlying comorbidities are considered to be at “high-risk” for severe illness from COVID-19. During this pandemic, dementia spousal caregivers are tasked with the burden of keeping their spouse safe from getting sick and even dying from COVID- 19, while simultaneously performing their typical caregiving responsibilities. The vast majority of dementia spousal caregivers and their spouses with dementia are over sixty-five years of age, the age bracket that puts people at most risk for COVID-19 disease complications and mortality. Social distancing guidelines make up a large proportion of the current prevention recommendations; thus, loneliness and other negative emotions will likely be frequent and more intense than usual. The proposed competitive revision builds upon the primary aims of the parent grant (R01AG062690) by using attachment theory as an overarching theoretical framework to understand dementia spousal caregiver risk and resilience in light of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 disease). The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PA-18-935, NOT-AG-20-022. Capitalizing on the dementia spousal caregivers who will take part in the parent study, we propose to collect additional data for one week each month for three months. We will collect this data using ecological momentary assessment methods, while passively assessing location, activity, autonomic activity, and sleep via smartphone and smartwatch technology. We aim to understand how emotions, assessed in real-time in the natural environment, affect the extent to which AD spousal caregivers adaptively navigate the challenges associated COVID-19. We will also aim to determine how relatively stable individual difference patterns that originate from people’s close relationship histories (i.e., attachment orientations) inform risk and resilience. As an exploratory high risk/high reward aim, we will evaluate if dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches can incorporate passively collected information (i.e., location, heart rate, heart rate variability, activity, sleep) with information that we learn from our primary aims, to yield a detailed and sophisticated understanding of real-world dynamics that predict three critical COVID-19 specific outcomes: social distancing adherence, social distancing self-efficacy, and caregiver self-efficacy. By understanding patterns of risk and resilience, intervention scientists will be better able to identify at-risk AD spousal caregivers. The proposed research would advance our understanding of how AD spousal caregivers can reduce illness exposure for themselves and those they care for in perhaps the most comprehensive, detailed, real-time, real-world investigation of social distancing in AD spousal caregivers to date. Narrative By identifying the factors that impede social distancing behaviors and impair a dementia spousal caregiver’s confidence to provide care, we will be able to design tailored and targeted interventions to reduce risk of COVID- 19 contagion, and improve quality of life for dementia spousal caregivers.",Individual differences in dementia spousal caregiver burden: A biobehavioral approach revision,10201213,R01AG062690,"['2019-nCoV', '5 year old', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'COVID-19', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elderly', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Homeostasis', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Location', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Efficacy', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Social Distance', 'Social Environment', 'Spouse Caregiver', 'Spouses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Virus', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'comorbidity', 'contagion', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'foot', 'heart rate variability', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'interest', 'mortality', 'pandemic disease', 'parent grant', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'risk prediction model', 'smart watch', 'social', 'theories']",NIA,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,493162,-0.05816631319021659
"A Health Equity Paradigm Shift:   Predictors of Healthy Pregnancy in African American Women ABSTRACT African-American women bear a disproportionate burden of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States, regardless of socio-economic, educational, or marital status. Fortunately, maternal death rarely occurs without warning. Pregnancy complications, such as those that increase the risk of future cardiovascular disease (preterm birth, growth restriction, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes), or severe maternal morbidity (SMM) can serve as sentinel events that herald the impending possibility of a mother's increased risk for maternal mortality (MM). Most health disparities studies to date have used a deficit-based model and have included white women as the reference group to identify detrimental factors. In this supplement, I propose to instead use a strength-based model that utilizes African-American women with healthy pregnancy outcomes as the reference group. I will compare them to African American women with pregnancy complications to identify protective factors because African American women with healthy pregnancies may provide key insight to inform future prevention strategies. The objective of this supplement is to identify environmental, systems, behavioral, medical, and biological constructs that predict a healthy, uncomplicated pregnancy in African- American women. The proposed supplemental study leverages a rich repository of clinical, survey and biospecimen data from a contemporary cohort of 852 African American women enrolled in an observational preterm birth study from 2017-2020, 549 (64%) of whom went on to have a healthy pregnancy, free from complications that predict future cardiovascular disease. I will use two complementary approaches, multi-level modeling and machine learning, to quantify the relative contributions of modifiable protective factors to a healthy pregnancy across multiple levels and domains of influence. Using an adaptation of the National Institute on Minority Health Disparities Research Framework, I will identify factors that protect African-American women from pregnancy complications that predict future cardiovascular disease (Aim 1.1), SMM (Aim 1.2), and a composite morbidity index combining the two (Aim 1.3). Finally, the work of interpreting the empirical findings from Aim 1, to develop potential interventions and policy changes, will begin in Aim 2. This aim is aspirational in nature, but included in this brief supplement to stress the importance of identifying actionable items from study findings of protective factors that are most amenable to targeting through interventions and/or health policy. A team of diverse stakeholders, including a Maternal Advisory Panel of African American Mothers, Clinicians, and Perinatal Researchers will use intervention mapping (a rigorous method that has been used to create behavioral health interventions) to review study findings, methodically think through ways to translate study findings into action, and make recommendations for future directions that are most likely to promote health equity for African American mothers. 1 NARRATIVE Most health disparities studies that have attempted to identify factors that explain the higher rates of severe maternal morbidity and mortality among African-American women have used a deficit-based model and included white women as the reference group to identify detrimental factors. In this supplement, I propose to instead use a strength-based model that utilizes African American women with healthy pregnancies as the reference group to identify protective factors that can be targeted through the design of future interventions to promote health equity. 1",A Health Equity Paradigm Shift:   Predictors of Healthy Pregnancy in African American Women,10200462,K23HD095075,"['Acute', 'African American', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Educational Status', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Promotion', 'Hematology', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Life Experience', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Policies', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Factor', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Proxy', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Secure', 'Sentinel', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Ursidae Family', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'behavioral health intervention', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'early pregnancy', 'health disparity', 'health equity', 'health goals', 'healthy pregnancy', 'indexing', 'insight', 'maternal morbidity', 'maternal risk', 'minority health', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnant', 'protective factors', 'racism', 'repository', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'severe maternal morbidity', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'working group']",NICHD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,162000,0.01741025809717371
"Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence ABSTRACT  Interventions in clinical settings, such as the emergency department (ED), are an opportunity for interpersonal firearm violence prevention, particularly among youth, whom interpersonal firearm violence disproportionately affects. A crucial prerequisite to successful clinical interventions is an accurate gauge of risk, to ensure the judicious allocation of scarce resources; providing that missing prerequisite is the primary goal of the proposed work. Machine learning methods, in contrast to traditional inferential statistical models, are distinguished by their emphasis on prospective prediction, and have enhanced clinical prediction in several fields, including heart disease, cancer diagnosis and outcomes, PTSD, suicide risk, and substance use, among others. Yet, with the exception of the SAFETY score—developed by the current investigative team—machine learning methods have not been leveraged to prospectively predict firearm violence. In this proposed work our research objectives are two-fold: 1) Externally validate the SAFETY score by determining its ability to predict firearm violence involvement within the next year on a new data set; and 2) Improve the SAFETY score by conducting a comparative analysis of four powerful machine learning methods: elastic net penalized logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and boosting (ensemble) methods. In this way, we are responding to Objective One: Research to help inform the development of innovative and promising opportunities to enhance safety and prevent firearm-related injuries, deaths, and crime. This approach is innovative because it builds upon the only work to apply machine learning methods to firearm violence prediction, and it is a promising opportunity to prevent firearm injuries because it will a) provide an explicit gauge of future firearm violence risk; and b) characterize risk factor effects in terms of their prospective prediction ability, unlike any prior research. Thus this research will both identify individuals in most need of intervention, and also point to potentially modifiable predictive factors. Properly addressing this research question in a generalizable way requires a contemporary data set with 1) a focus on a high-need, yet broad, study population; 2) comprehensive baseline measures that provide a broad basis for prediction; and 3) geographic variability (Midwest, West Coast, and East Coast) that enhances generalizability. Thus, we will recruit 1,500 youth age 18-24 from urban EDs in three broadly different locales—Flint, Philadelphia, and Seattle—and administer a baseline survey covering several domains of potential risk factors for future violence, and follow up with those youth at 6- and 12-months to ascertain the primary outcome—firearm violence involvement (as victim or perpetrator)—as well as the secondary outcomes: high-risk firearm behaviors, non-firearm violence, and violent injury. Because this work requires a prospective longitudinal study, we are applying for Option B. This work will lay the ground for future research involving the development and testing of interventions for interpersonal firearm violence both by identifying potential high- leverage modifiable predictive factors, and by identifying youth most in need of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The purpose of the proposed work is to harness cutting-edge machine learning methods to optimize prediction of future firearm violence so that prevention resources can be allocated efficiently. In service to that goal, we will recruit participants age 18-24 from three urban emergency departments, administer a comprehensive assessment, and use the measurements taken there to predict firearm violence over the following year. The proposed work will provide generalizable knowledge on what factors are most predictive of future firearm violence, which will contribute to future intervention strategies both in terms of content and in terms of optimally determining which people require intervention.",Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence,10162695,R01CE003294,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,649991,-0.007955500676060368
"Disparities in COVID Disease Severity and Outcomes in New York City PROJECT SUMMARY This application is being submitted in response to Notice Number: NOT-TR-20-011 to highlight the urgent need for research on the 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), and is an administration supplement to our parent grant. The outbreak of COVID-19 and the life-threatening acute respiratory syndrome caused by the virus (SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV) have led to a severe, global public health crisis, and economic disruption. Sadly, in this epidemic, NYC is the epicenter of epicenters. Some neighborhoods in NYC have been more exposed than others to COVID, and there seems to be clear correlation with the prevalence of COVID and its severity between certain ethnic and racial populations. Importantly, it is recognized that biology factors alone do not exclusively account for disease outcomes in those stricken with Covid-19. Social determinants have a significant impact on various health-related outcomes such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, kidney and lung disease (1,2). Evidence also indicates that a myriad of social risk factors- such as low income, poor education, minority race or ethnic background- coupled with inadequate community housing and resources, together with limited health care access and decreased health utilization, results in poor health outcomes and increased susceptibility and severity to Covid-19 (3-14). For this study, we assembled a multidisciplinary team from Weill Cornell Medicine's Clinical Translational Science Center (CTSC); Englander Institute for Precision Medicine (EIPM), the Weill Cornell's Center for Health Equity. The initial study will be conducted with the New York Presbyterian (NYP) Hospital health care system database involving “hotspot” areas in NYC with COVID. The NYP network is the largest healthcare system by bed counts in New York City and is on the frontlines of the struggle against the COVID pandemic. By discerning the interaction/relationship of the biology with the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH), we will gain further insight into why certain racial and ethnic groups are more susceptible to Covid -19, and why they develop the more severe forms of the virus. Furthermore, if we are able to identify the especially vulnerable, and provide adequate isolation and early medical intervention in the disease process- then we can save lives. Protecting and providing preventive and early care for the vulnerable would also allow the remainder of society to interact in daily activities and prevent the economy from a major collapse. The less vulnerable who are out in society would on average develop mild coronavirus infections. Consequently, once the larger and mildly affected less vulnerable population recover and gain natural immunity, the risk to the most vulnerable would fall dramatically and the country would stabilize. NARRATIVE The overall goal of this research is to determine the biological and social determinants of health that collectively explain the marked racial/ethnic variations in COVID-19 severity and outcomes. Recent reports from the NYC Department of Health and elsewhere strongly suggest that underserved minority populations and especially African Americans and Hispanics have much higher COVID-19 fatality rate when compared to Caucasians and Asians (1-3). The reasons for such these disparities are not known. biological determinants and such as access to care, adequate housing, and occupation may represent major risk factors for acquiring Covid-19 and especially a more severe manifestation of Covid-19. We hypothesize that defining the biological factors and determining the interrelationship with Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) in combination with clinical factors will provide clarification as to why certain racial and ethnic groups are more susceptible to Covid -19, and to developing the more severe forms of the disease.",Disparities in COVID Disease Severity and Outcomes in New York City,10159057,UL1TR002384,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asians', 'Beds', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'COVID-19', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Chicago', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Communities', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Cytometry', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Outcome', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Fatality rate', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Life', 'Low income', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Immunity', 'Neighborhoods', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Unemployment', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'coronavirus disease', 'experience', 'falls', 'genetic signature', 'health care availability', 'health equity', 'high risk', 'hospitalization rates', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nutrition', 'pandemic disease', 'parent grant', 'patient stratification', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'respiratory', 'response', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'supervised learning', 'underserved minority']",NCATS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,UL1,2020,749219,0.010132325631246384
"Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes Summary The objective of this proposal is to optimize the design and evaluate a robust artificial pancreas (R-AP) system for use in patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (T1D) with HbA1C greater than 8% and compare HbA1C outcomes in these patients relative to a decision support system that utilizes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. Although high risk patients have possibly the most to gain from usage of AP technology, they are oftentimes under-represented or excluded from clinical trials. This has been because of the increased risk of failure of these AP systems that were not designed to handle inconsistent reporting of meals, variable activity level, and infusion set failures. An AP system for high risk patients needs to be designed to achieve maximal benefit, including reducing the risk of acute and chronic complications. A major obstacle for enabling the AP for usage by high-risk patients is that these patients may be less compliant with use guidelines for the system including missed meal announcements, infrequent sensor calibrations, and prolonged infusion set wear leading to infusion set failures. In this grant, we will integrate new risk-mitigation features into the OHSU single-hormone AP to enable usage by high-risk patients that fall into the categories described above. We present new algorithms for automating the detection of missed meal announcements, missed calibrations, and robust handling of hybrid usage mode. While AP systems may be an optimal choice for improving glycemic control, many people with T1D prefer MDI therapy. Decision support systems such as the DailyDose decision support system developed at OHSU can be used to improve glycemic control for patients who prefer MDI therapy. The DailyDose decision support system is designed for CGM augmented MDI therapy. It enables on-demand calculation of insulin doses, automates insulin dose adjustments based on pattern recognition, and uses machine learning approaches to alert the patients to events such as predicted hypoglycemia and missed meal doses.The benefit of the DailyDose system is that it is a simple system and does not require use of an insulin pump, which may be a challenge for some patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes as pump therapy is more intensive and requires infusion set changes. It is unknown in this high risk group of people whether patient needs, quality of life, and glycemic control are best addressed with an AP system or decision support tool or if both treatments are appropriate. We have designed a 3-month clinical study to compare glycemic outcomes during AP vs. decision support interventions in a high- risk T1D cohort (HbA1C 8-10.5%), with the aim of demonstrating a significant clinically relevant reduction in HbA1C. Our hypothesis is that both AP and decision support therapies will decrease HbA1C relative to baseline but that the AP will provide further benefit over DailyDose. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. We propose to integrate features into the OHSU artificial pancreas to optimize it for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c>8-10.5%) and compare it to DailyDose, a decision support system that uses multiple daily injections.",Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes,9969424,R01DK120367,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Carbohydrates', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modification', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'arm', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes distress', 'engineering design', 'expectation', 'falls', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'in silico', 'patient population', 'primary outcome', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'risk mitigation', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'support tools']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,599203,0.017736258519430035
"EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy Project Summary Dr. Jennifer A. Kim is a critical care neurologist and neuroscientist at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded translational investigator with expertise in signal processing of neurophysiologic and neuroimaging data to identify early biomarkers of secondary brain injury in critically ill patients, particularly related to post-traumatic epilepsy. Post-traumatic epilepsy is a disabling complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is an urgent need to find biomarkers of post-traumatic epilepsy to identify patients at high risk for developing this complication. It is a population in which early biomarker identification could improve patient monitoring and ultimately treatment development to circumvent epileptogenesis. Post- traumatic epilepsy contributes to worsening of the already high rates of TBI morbidity, disability and cost of care, thus emphasizing the importance of preventing this complication. We need to find biomarkers to best define those most likely to benefit from potential treatments and make such treatment discovery trials more feasible. During the proposed training period, the candidate will expand upon her knowledge of EEG signal processing and machine learning techniques and acquire new skills in neuroimaging analysis using Magnetic Resonance technologies and biostatistics. To accomplish this, Dr. Kim has brought together a strong mentorship team of Dr. Hal Blumenfeld (primary mentor) and co-mentors Drs. Todd Constable, Brandon Westover and Brian Edlow who have expertise in multi-modal approaches to studying epilepsy, functional MRI analysis, computational EEG analysis and structural TBI imaging, respectively. Under their mentorship, Dr. Kim proposes to: 1) quantify epileptiform abnormality (EA) frequency and identify EA waveform features that optimally predict PTE, 2) determine if direct hippocampal injury, assessed by cortical thickness and contusion volume, stratifies PTE risk 3) assess whether indirect hippocampal injury, based on structural and functional MRI connectivity analyses, portend PTE. The overall goal is to identify early biomarkers of patients at high risk for post-traumatic epilepsy to target development of anti-epileptogenesis treatments. Bringing together advanced neurophysiologic and neuroimaging analysis and this strong mentorship support, this project opens new avenues for optimizing follow-up care and advancing potential treatment development for all traumatic brain injury patients at risk for post-traumatic epilepsy. This well-defined patient-oriented research proposal, in concert with the mentorship and structured didactic curriculum, will provide Dr. Kim with the skills that are essential to develop an independent career in neurophysiological and neuroimaging research that translates to improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Post-traumatic epilepsy, a seizure disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI), is among the most disabling and difficult-to-treat complications of TBI. Currently, there are no tools to identify patients a priori at highest risk for PTE. Dr. Kim's proposed career development plan has great potential to advance our knowledge of the acute biomarkers of PTE using EEG and MRI, to improve early identification and ultimately provide treatment options for this potentially preventable complication.",EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy,10055272,K23NS112596,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Atrophic', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blinded', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Complication', 'Contusions', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Prevention trial', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Rodent Model', 'Sclerosis', 'Secondary to', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'care costs', 'career', 'career development', 'cost estimate', 'didactic education', 'disability', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'human imaging', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'preventable epilepsy', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,192780,0.004652948494113621
"Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark's population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation. This will inform the development of interventions to address the neighborhood factors that affect Alzheimer's disease.",Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors,9922214,R01AG063385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Attention', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Blood Vessels', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Experience', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Minority Groups', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Refugees', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Social Sciences', 'Socialization', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Violence', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical encounter', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'deprivation', 'diabetes risk', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'residence', 'response', 'social', 'social factors', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'treatment effect', 'vascular risk factor', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,522652,0.03141288434376932
"Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Strom received an MD from Harvard Medical School (HMS), and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (BIDMC), and non-invasive cardiac imaging (BIDMC). Additionally, he completed an MSc in Epidemiology program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in May, 2018. He is now a junior faculty member at BIDMC with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. Through this proposed 5-year program, Dr. Strom will pursue additional training in advanced prediction modeling, machine learning, patient-oriented research, and metabolomics. The candidate’s long- term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the area of applied outcomes research. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Robert W. Yeh (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Director of the Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology, Robert E. Gerszten (Co-Mentor), Professor of Medicine at HMS and Chief of Cardiovascular Medicine at BIDMC, and Changyu Shen (Co-Mentor), upcoming Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Lead Biostatistician for the Smith Center. Dr. Yeh has a track record of leading practice-changing studies and successful mentorship of clinician investigators. Dr. Gerszten is an internationally recognized expert in molecular phenotyping of cardiovascular diseases using metabolomics and proteomics and has mentored several K-award and R01 funded clinical investigators. Dr. Shen has a long track record of NIH funding, expertise in evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effect in cardiovascular diseases, and has mentored multiple prior trainees. Research: The optimal therapy for a given individual with aortic stenosis remains uncertain. This proposal seeks to define the clinical and biologic components of frailty that modify risk after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and alter treatment benefit. For Aims 1-2, we will leverage the unique linkage of Medicare data to the US CoreValve Pivotal trials, a collection of clinical trials that randomized individuals with severe aortic stenosis to transcatheter AVR (TAVR) with a self-expanding bioprosthesis vs. surgical AVR (SAVR). In Aim 1, we will we will identify which variables, related to in-person assessments of frailty and candidate frailty codes, best predict adverse outcomes after AVR. In Aim 2, we will identify if novel variables identified in Aim 1, identify a heterogeneous treatment response in individuals undergoing AVR. In Aim 3, we will prospectively enroll patients undergoing TAVR at BIDMC with concurrent frailty phenotyping to identify whether metabolites associated with longevity correlate with frailty and predict adverse outcomes, independent of age and comorbidities. The research will identify the mechanisms by which frailty confers adverse risk and differential treatment benefit in AVR, providing insights that may personalize treatment selection and improve patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE While new technologies have permitted the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis, which is fatal without treatment, deciding on the optimal treatment for a given patient is often difficult, especially as these decisions are often made towards the end of life and there are significant risks concomitant with each treatment. In this setting, frailty, a state of debility that impairs recovery from illness, has emerged as a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes but the mechanisms by which frailty confers risk and the components of frailty that are most important are unknown. In this proposal, we seek to define the clinical and biological components of frailty that contribute risk in aortic valve replacement using a combination of novel data sources and methodologic techniques, including linkage of clinical trials to administrative data, machine learning, and metabolite profiling, in order to personalize treatments and optimize patient health and medical decision making.",Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling,9969556,K23HL144907,"['Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bioprosthesis device', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronology', 'Citric Acid Cycle', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Israel', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physician Executives', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'aortic valve replacement', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'end of life', 'frailty', 'health data', 'health service use', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'mid-career faculty', 'minimally invasive', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'surgical risk', 'treatment effect', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2020,172800,0.012257721904684143
"Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects of School Racial Segregation on Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Youth and Young Adults ABSTRACT  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors disproportionately affect black adults, and these disparities are evident early in the life course. Genetic factors do not appear to explain this difference, and studies have increasingly implicated socioeconomic risk factors. Among the most prominent risk factors for racial disparities in CVD is educational attainment, which is strongly correlated with smoking, hypertension, and CVD over the life course. Yet it is unclear which aspects of schooling are most salient. One possible explanation for racial disparities in CVD is that black youth often attend highly racially segregated schools. Segregation is thought to be linked with CVD due to increased stress and discrimination; social norms and peer influence; and the constraining of socioeconomic opportunities that reduces income and healthcare access later in life. Yet despite the fact that school segregation has increased in recent years, there are no studies examining the effects of recent school segregation trends on CVD risk factors. The goal of this study is to provide this urgently needed evidence. In particular, we take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on the effects of education on CVD. Since 1990, numerous local court decisions have resulted in “resegregation” in school districts across the country. We link nationwide data on these court decisions and school district-level measures of school segregation with CVD outcome data from two large nationally representative U.S. cohort studies of affected youth: the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health, N≈90,000) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N≈8,000). We employ the quasi-experimental technique of instrumental variables analysis, which reduces typical confounding by factors such as unobserved individual and family characteristics. In Aim 1, our goal is to estimate the short- term effects of school segregation on CVD risk factors—including smoking, physical activity, obesity, and mental health—among youth while they are still in school. In Aim 2, we will examine the long-term effects of school segregation in the decades that follow, with outcomes including those in Aim 1 in addition to objectively measured CVD biomarkers, diabetes, and hypertension. We will also undertake exploratory analyses to determine possible mediating pathways. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of CVD risk factors differs in response to school racial segregation. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of school racial segregation on CVD risk factors, helping to inform school-based, clinical, and community interventions to reduce persistent and inequitable racial disparities in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the short-term and long-term effects of school racial segregation on risk factors for heart disease. We will also assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to school segregation. This will inform the development of public health programs and school-based interventions to address black-white disparities in heart disease.",Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects of School Racial Segregation on Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Youth and Young Adults,9943540,R01HL151638,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Country', 'Court Decisions', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desegregation', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Family Characteristics', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Stress', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health', 'Natural experiment', 'Obesity', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'black/white disparity', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'community intervention', 'data archive', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'forest', 'health care availability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'novel marker', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'peer influence', 'peer networks', 'physical inactivity', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'racial disparity', 'resilience', 'response', 'school district', 'segregation', 'social', 'social norm', 'socioeconomics', 'teenage fertility', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'young adult']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,808862,0.02413169945986518
"Modeling of infectious network dynamics for surveillance, control and prevention enhancement (MINDSCAPE) PROJECT SUMMARY: Mathematical analysis, computational statistics, and machine learning are increasingly being deployed to understand and predict the dynamics of healthcare associated infections (HAI) and antimicrobial-resistant infections (ARI). However, the utility of these models to guiding clinical and health policy decisions often remains unclear. One challenge is that model calibration quickly becomes obsolete as the epidemiology of HAI and ARI changes. To address this gap, we propose to use mathematical modeling and machine learning approaches to build decision-making technologies that improve the risk assessment, prevention, and control of HAI and ARI. Our proposed technologies account for spatial and temporal dynamics, provide continuous, real-time feedback to clinicians and are robust to changes in risk factors and disease prevalence over time. We anticipate that implementation of these technological improvements will help healthcare institutions to substantially reduce the burden of HAI and ARI. We concentrate our efforts on two of the most important HAI: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridioides difficile infections. To conduct these studies, we assembled a team of mathematical modelers, machine learning specialists, health economists, clinical informaticists, infectious disease physicians, and hospital epidemiologists based in California, New York, and Texas. Clinical, microbiological and environmental data to train our models will come from three academic quaternary medical centers and an expanding network of community hospitals. The first aim is to calculate the patient-specific risk of acquiring or transmitting a HAI or ARI. We hypothesize that the risk of acquiring an HAI or ARI is more accurately determined when data on patient movement and pathogen exposure are integrated into predictive models. This type of analysis is also expected to improve the risk assessment of automated systems used to detect HAI and ARI outbreaks. The second aim is to prevent invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. One objective is to show that cost-effective reduction of invasive MRSA infections and hospital-based transmission can be achieved via personalized decisions for who should be screened for asymptomatic carriage and decolonized. Our third aim is to control the spread of Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI). We hypothesize that by calculating the number of CDI averted and the cost saved, models of disease transmission will demonstrate the benefit pre- emptive adoption of contact precautions for patients who are at high risk of transmitting CDI. We also expect to identify environmental pathways that contribute to the risk of CDI superspreading and would benefit from enhanced surveillance and decontamination. Finally, to better understand the importance of antibiotic stewardship programs, we characterize the specific role a patient's antibiotic, infection, social, exposure and colonization history plays in the personal risk of acquiring an invasive MRSA infection and CDI. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to use mathematical modeling, agent-based simulation and machine learning approaches to build decision-making technologies that improve the risk assessment, prevention and control of healthcare- associated infections and antibiotic-resistant infections. Our proposed technologies will account for spatial and temporal dynamics, provide continuous, real-time feedback to clinicians and are robust to changes in risk factors and disease prevalence over time.

"Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation Modeling to Improve the Health of Minority Populations Project Summary/Abstract Significant health disparities exist in chronic kidney disease (CKD), CKD progression, and end stage renal disease (ESRD) in ethnically diverse populations. African Americans (AAs) have ~25% higher prevalence of CKD, 3-fold higher rate of ESRD, and the highest risk of mortality among those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 45-95mL/min/1.73m2. The most significant traditional risk factors for CKD and ESRD are diabetes and hypertension accounting for >60% CKD and >70% of new ESRD cases, respectively. Non- traditional risk factors for CKD such as environmental, cultural-behavioral factors, geographic, education, insurance coverage, socioeconomic status and unequal access to optimal healthcare, disproportionately affect CKD health in ethnic minorities. The unique combination of these factors on CKD progression in the real world remains poorly defined. Identification of modifiable risk factors that may reduce CKD disparities would be invaluable to improve quality of life, life expectancy, and decrease economic burden. Simulation models have been successfully applied in other clinical domains, but are limited in CKD development and CKD progression, due to small datasets and the absence of modeling techniques using longitudinal observational health data. Further, no models have been tested in a real-world minority population to uncover the potential for interventional studies that would reduce CKD disparities on a larger scale. To our knowledge, we have created the largest, comprehensive database from electronic health records of >10 million individuals seen between 2006-2016 from a 2-year partnership between UCLA (1.8 million) and Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH; 9.2 million) systems. From the UCLA Registry population, we identified significant differences in eGFR trajectory decline between AAs and non-AAs according to baseline eGFR, indicating a pattern shift from a higher to a lower, steeper eGFR trajectory suggesting there may be critical windows for interventions to reduce CKD disparities in AAs. Race/ethnicity differences from linear mixed models of all ethnic cohorts persisted even after controlling for demographic and clinical variables known to influence eGFR trajectories. We hypothesize that the use of ethnically diverse populations in the joint UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry can identify a novel combination of CKD risk factors; and improve the performance of existing simulation models to predict CKD progression. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a machine learning-based simulation model for CKD and eGFR trajectories using the UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry; and conduct internal validation of the models and comparisons with existing CKD risk models, 2) stratify and test simulation models based on different racial/ethnic groups, including external validation based on cross-institution comparisons, and 3) conduct focus groups with UCLA primary care physicians, who manage racial/ethnic patients, to elicit their perspectives on existing and designed simulation models to reduce CKD health disparities. These innovative approaches will facilitate our long-term goal to inform clinical decision support methods to reduce/eliminate CKD health disparities. Project Narrative Disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affect the development of CKD and CKD progression in ethnic minorities. The ability to use large datasets of patient information to reduce these disparities is greatly lacking. We will conduct simulation modeling to identify a unique set of risk factors that predict CKD and CKD progression, that can be targeted for individualized treatment in patients with highest risk of kidney function decline, with valuable input on the potential utility of this resource from focus groups consisting of primary care physicians.",Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation Modeling to Improve the Health of Minority Populations,9848452,R01MD014712,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Education', 'Educational Background', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'End stage renal failure', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic group', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Statistics', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Registries', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Environment', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Urban Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data registry', 'design', 'disease registry', 'disorder risk', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic diversity', 'ethnic minority population', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'minority health', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'racial and ethnic']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,389501,-0.02683831993947845
"Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities Project Summary/Abstract From 2000-2014, hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, incidence rates increased nearly 4% per year, while most cancers in the United States were on the decline. HCC disproportionately impacts minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. To inform primary prevention strategies that will reduce disparities in HCC risk, we need to determine the relative contribution of well- established and emerging (e.g., hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, alcohol, smoking, cirrhosis, NAFLD, metabolic disorders, diabetes, HIV infection), and novel (e.g., medications, comorbidities, neighborhood attributes) risk factors to these disparities. To inform secondary and tertiary prevention strategies to reduce disparities in HCC burden, we need to understand the multilevel factors that contribute to HCC surveillance disparities. Answering these gaps in knowledge requires a robust high-quality study with a sample enriched for racial/ethnic minorities. Thus, we propose to leverage existing multi-disciplinary collaborations to develop an integrated dataset that includes electronic health records (EHR) data linked to population-based state cancer registry data and geospatial contextual data. This multilevel resource will include data on nearly 2.3 million individuals from three healthcare systems (mixed payer, integrated healthcare, federally qualified health centers) in California and Hawaii, thus providing diversity in healthcare settings and enrichment for racial/ethnic minorities: 59,400 are Black, 189,500 are Hispanic, and 441,700 are Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI). With this resource, we specifically aim to: (1) assess the relative importance of established and emerging examine the extent to which these factors independently and jointly contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk; (2) discover novel risk factors and assess their relative importance to HCC risk; and (3) assess racial/ethnic disparities in adherence with surveillance for HCC as well as examine the extent to which these disparities are attributable to modifiable individual-, clinician-, system-, and neighborhood factors (Aim 3). For Aim 1, using prospective data, we will assess the relative importance of risk factors and their contribution to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk with causal inference methods. For Aim 2, we will apply innovative machine learning methods to identify novel factors and validate their associations with HCC risk using modeling strategy from Aim 1. For Aim 3, we will use multilevel generalized linear regression to investigate the patient, clinician, institutional and geographic factors that contribute to disparities in HCC surveillance. Given the importance of sex and age/birth cohort for HCC risk, these social determinants will be considered together with race/ethnicity using an intersectional approach. By applying a multilevel framework to understand how biological, clinical, and social factors at multiple levels contribute to HCC disparities in incidence and surveillance, the proposed study will identify modifiable factors that can be translated to the clinical and community settings to collaboratively identify strategies to ameliorate racial/ethnic disparities in HCC. Project Narrative While most cancer incidence and mortality in the United States are declining, the burden of liver cancer is increasing; yet, we do not understand what causes 40% of these cancers. Furthermore, this cancer impacts racial/ethnic groups disproportionately, with minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. Therefore we propose to study the relative contribution of established and emerging risk factors, discover and validate novel risk factors, and to understand patient, clinician, healthcare system and geographic factors that influence surveillance; these findings can then be used to inform strategies in clinical and community settings to reduce the burden of liver cancer particularly for those at high risk.",Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities,9997828,R01CA225478,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Alcohols', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'HIV Infections', 'Hawaii', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Maintenance Organizations', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive measure', 'Primary Prevention', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'built environment', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer health disparity', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'comorbidity', 'data registry', 'disparity reduction', 'electronic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'sex', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social disparities', 'social factors', 'socioeconomics', 'tertiary prevention']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,645058,0.03444266042957006
"Role of visceral adipose tissue in frailty among patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this application for a 5-year K23 Career Development Award, I propose mentored research and career development leading to a career as an independent clinical and translational investigator in interstitial lung disease (ILD). The goal of this project is to identify the role of body composition in frailty among subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The prevalence of IPF is rising, currently affecting 1 in 200 older adults. There is no cure for IPF. The only available medications slow disease progression but do not reverse disease. Frailty affects up to 50% of IPF patients, and is characterized by decreased physiologic reserve and increased susceptibility to severe manifestations of acute insults. The most common causes of death in IPF are acute insults. Frailty is thus a potentially modifiable risk factor for morbidity and mortality in IPF. This proposal builds on my preliminary work showing that (1) greater visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with increased frailty, (2) subjects with both sarcopenia and visceral obesity are at greater risk of frailty than those with sarcopenia alone, (3) there may be distinct endotypes of exercise limitation defined by high inflammation alone or low inflammation with high VAT, and (4) down-regulation of the growth hormone (GH) axis may link VAT and frailty. Under the mentorship of Dr. R Graham Barr, I propose to evaluate the roles of body composition by bioelectrical impedance assay (co-mentor Gallagher), inflammation, and neuroendocrine dysregulation associated with frailty risk using a machine-learning approach (co-mentor Valeri). I will also evaluate the role of growth hormone axis dysregulation in sarcopenia with visceral obesity in a rigorous overnight protocol (co-mentor Freda). I propose to perform this in two NHLBI-funded prospective cohorts: Dr. Garcia’s Families-At-Risk for ILD (R01HL103676) and Dr. Singer’s Advanced Lung Disease Lung Transplantation Study (R01HL134851). With guidance from my mentors, I have crafted a 5-year career development plan that includes training in body composition analysis (Dr. Gallagher), measurement of complex endocrine systems (Dr. Freda), clinical trials (Dr. Freda), biostatistics (Dr. Valeri), aging in interstitial lung disease (Dr. Garcia), and epidemiology (Dr. Barr). In the last two years of this award, I will apply for R01 funding and transition to independence. The proposed activities will prepare me to conduct patient-oriented research to evaluate the role of body composition in outcomes in ILD. I will also acquire the skills and training required to design and conduct clinical trials targeting novel pathways to prevent and treat frailty in ILD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an increasingly prevalent chronic lung disease with no available cure; frailty affects 50% of IPF patients, and is associated with increased severity of illness in response to acute insults, which are the most common cause of death in IPF. We identified that visceral adipose tissue is a risk factor for frailty and propose to investigate potential mechanisms linking visceral adipose tissue and frailty, as modifiable risk factors for morbidity and mortality in this growing patient population. Our findings may lead to novel therapies and clinical trials evaluating the role of existing medications in the prevention and treatment of frailty in IPF.",Role of visceral adipose tissue in frailty among patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,10055250,K23HL150280,"['Acute', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'American', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Biolectric Impedance', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Body Composition', 'Body mass index', 'Cause of Death', 'Central obesity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine system', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hospitalization', 'Inflammation', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Interleukin-1 Receptors', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Societies', 'Somatotropin', 'Somatotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Steroids', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Variant', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'androgenic', 'career', 'career development', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'frailty', 'growth hormone deficiency', 'health related quality of life', 'hormone analog', 'human old age (65+)', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'muscle form', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'pulmonary rehabilitation', 'reduced muscle mass', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sarcopenia', 'sarcopenic obesity', 'skills training', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'translational approach', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K23,2020,170856,-0.03543851973774116
"Metal-nutrient mixtures in epidemiologic and toxicologic studies of cardiovascular disease Abstract This proposal is designed to extend and complement our R01-funded case-cohort study of cadmium (Cd) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Herein we will add arsenic (As), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) to our case-cohort study and include epidemiologic and toxicologic mixtures analyses. The four elements we have selected are compelling for their independent role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and as a mixture. As increases plaque formation and adhesion to endothelium and Cd also induces endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis; yet it is not clear if the effects of As and Cd are synergistic or competing. To potentially counteract these processes, Mg is important for modulating endothelial function. While Ca’s role is equivocal, its role in calcification of the arteries is undeniable, making it important to consider as well. Our efficient case-cohort study design includes 810 cases of AMI and a comparison subcohort of 600 men and 600 women selected randomly from never smokers at risk of AMI at the start of follow-up, leveraging the prospective population-based Danish Diet Cancer and Health Cohort. We are already funded to measure Cd, creatinine, osmolality, and cotinine in baseline urine samples. We now propose to additionally analyze As species, Mg, and Ca in urine among ~2000 participants selected into this case-cohort study, along with pre-existing food frequency questionnaire data on Mg and Ca. In Aim 1 we will evaluate the association between each of As, Ca, and Mg, and incidence of AMI. This will be one of the largest prospective studies of these elements in relation to AMI. In Aim 2 we will apply mixtures methods (Bayesian kernel machine regression, weighted quantile sum regression, random forests) to evaluate the interactive and joint effects of Cd, As, Ca, and Mg in relation to AMI risk. In Aim 3 we will apply in vitro and in vivo approaches to study combined effects of exposure to these elements to investigate the toxicologic mechanisms and pathways of activity. Each Aim is independently compelling and will provide important scientific contributions but together the complementary approaches have the potential to provide evidence of consistency in findings across the distinct approaches. Triangulating data across in vitro, in vivo and epidemiologic analyses represents a translational bridge as depicted in the NIEHS translational research framework. The scope of this virtual consortium will enrich our understanding of the relationships between Cd, As, Mg, Ca, and CVD. Other innovative features of our study include leveraging an existing efficient case-cohort design, large sample size, a large number of incident AMI events, controlling for tobacco smoking, in vitro assays of pro-atherogenic mechanisms, and in vivo studies of atherosclerosis. Sources of exposure to these elements are well known, therefore the identification of mixtures of these elements as cardiovascular risk/protective factors can have major implications for the prevention and control of CVD. Public Health Relevance Mechanistic and epidemiologic studies suggest a mixture of elements including cadmium, arsenic, magnesium, and calcium may play an important role in cardiovascular disease as risk and protective factors. We propose to create a virtual consortium to study chemical mixtures of these elements in relation to risk of cardiovascular disease using state-of-the-art techniques in exposure science, epidemiology, biostatistics, and cardio-toxicology. Sources of exposure to these elements are well known, therefore the identification of mixtures of these elements as cardiovascular risk/protective factors can have major implications for the prevention and control of cardiovascular disease.",Metal-nutrient mixtures in epidemiologic and toxicologic studies of cardiovascular disease,10063369,R01ES030938,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adhesions', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arsenic', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Cadmium', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Cotinine', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Hypertension', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lipids', 'Magnesium', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nutrient', 'Osmolalities', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Questionnaires', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Side', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Toxicology', 'Translational Research', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'calcification', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'design', 'diet and cancer', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'men', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'never smoker', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'urinary', 'virtual']",NIEHS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2020,618191,0.0020067836389051174
"Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress PROJECT SUMMARY Childhood traumatic stress (CTS), resulting from experiences such as abuse and neglect, is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences effecting overall health across the lifespan. Growing evidence shows that the negative effects of CTS are not limited to a single individual and may be transmitted across generations, increasing the risk for behavioral and psychiatric disorders in the offspring. Psychological stress during pregnancy is associated with heightened stress responses, emotional dysregulation, and behavioral problems in infancy and early childhood potentially making it a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of trauma. The majority of studies examining maternal psychological stress (MPS) during pregnancy consider the magnitude of stress as the `risk factor' for alterations in offspring development; however, psychological stress, particularly during the prenatal period, is dynamic and variable. Infant neurodevelopment occurs sequentially and is sensitive to environmental influences, meaning that the effect of any insult is likely as much about the timing, as it is the magnitude. As a result, it remains unclear which aspects of stress most strongly impact offspring development – is it simply the magnitude as previously suggested, or does the trajectory matter as well? Understanding the variability of prenatal factors and their influence on infant neurobiological and psychosocial development is critical to targeting preventive interventions. The goal of this proposal is to explore maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress. The overall hypothesis is that a history of maternal CTS will increase the amplitude and velocity of MPS trajectories compared to a low-risk group, will predict increased offspring limbic system connectivity and negative affect expression, and that an intervention to reduce MPS in a high-risk sample will alter the observed trajectories. These hypotheses will be tested using a novel methodology that characterizes the longitudinal heterogeneity of psychological symptom data to create MPS trajectories. These trajectories will be used to explore the role of timing and rate of change of MPS on offspring neurobiological and affective development and, further, to test whether these trajectories mediate the effects of CTS on infant development. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To characterize the longitudinal heterogeneity of MPS in a sample of women with and without a history of CTS; (2) To examine the effects of heterogeneous longitudinal trajectories in MPS on offspring limbic system and negative affect development in mothers with and without childhood trauma; and (3) (Exploratory) To determine whether an intervention designed to reduce MPS will alter MPS trajectories in a high-risk sample. This study aims to elucidate the importance of trajectories of MPS for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS. Achieving these goals will provide insight into the best timing for targeted screening and interventions to alter MPS during pregnancy for women with a history of CTS and, thereby, reduce the risk of offspring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood traumatic stress is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences for psychological well-being, such as increased stress reactivity and increased risk for perinatal psychopathology. The proposed research will integrate tools from developmental neuroscience, clinical science, and computer science to: (1) examine the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a potential mediator of childhood traumatic stress on infant brain and negative affect development; and (2) evaluate whether an intervention designed to reduce maternal psychological stress will alter the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal prenatal stress. By identifying the importance of trajectories of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS, this work stands to improve the targeting and timing of prenatal interventions for women with a history of childhood traumatic stress.",Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress,9999677,F30MH118762,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Limbic System', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'maternal risk', 'maternal stress', 'mindfulness based cognitive therapy', 'negative affect', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pediatric trauma', 'prenatal', 'prenatal intervention', 'prenatal stress', 'psychological symptom', 'psychosocial development', 'random forest', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'stress reactivity', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,50520,0.009453699404944414
"Development and Validation of a Prediction Model to Address Physician Burnout PROJECT SUMMARY Professional burnout is a growing epidemic with symptoms affecting over 500,000 US physicians at any given time and carries significant adverse consequences for physician mental health, health care value, quality of care, and patient safety. There is an urgent need to develop reliable methods to proactively identify work environments at high risk for physician burnout, and tailor process improvements accordingly. The objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a real-time prediction model that uses operational data in primary care practices to identify high-risk clinics for physician burnout, enabling timely and tailored process improvements. The central hypothesis is that routinely-collected electronic health record (EHR) usage metrics coupled with practice-specific metrics can predict physicians’ risk for burnout and inform process improvement. The rationale for the proposed research is that early identification of high-risk clinics will allow organizations to tailor interventions to those clinics before burnout and its individual or health system consequences arise. This would be an innovative approach that prevents burnout rather than reacting to it. This project capitalizes on routinely-collect data from Stanford primary care clinics to create a database encompassing EHR usage metrics and practice-specific metrics. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Develop a prediction model to quantify risk for physician burnout. The working hypothesis is that real-time metrics of practice efficiency tracked by the EHR and other practice-specific metrics can predict physician burnout using a machine learning approach. Aim 2: Refine the prediction model using qualitative methods. The working hypothesis is that qualitative assessment will inform refinements to the prediction model created in Aim 1, and will demonstrate the face validity of the model. Aim 3: Validate the use of the prediction model to identify high-risk clinics. The working hypothesis is that quality of care metrics will demonstrate the concurrent validity, that subsequent routinely administered burnout surveys will demonstrate the predictive validity of the prediction model created in Aims 1 and 2, when aggregated at the clinic level. This proposal is significant because physician burnout is a growing problem with important implications for patient safety. It is also innovative in deploying machine learning and mixed methods to identify physicians at increased risk for burnout which will enable testing interventions to reverse this trend. In combination with formal training in quantitative and qualitative methods, expert mentorship, and participation in selected scholarly activities at Stanford, the experience gained through this project will facilitate progress toward a long-term goal to become an academic leader advancing evidence-based reform of the health care delivery system to optimize human factors that improve quality and safety. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an urgent need to develop reliable methods to proactively identify and improve work environments with high risk for physician burnout, and doing so will have broad public health relevance by reducing risk for burnout and its negative effects on quality and safety of care. Addressing physician burnout in primary care carries relevance for AHRQ’s priority populations of women, children, the elderly, and low-income patients, who are particularly dependent on high quality primary care. This project will support AHRQ’s mission of producing evidence to make health care safer and higher quality by developing and validating a prediction model to identify high-risk primary care clinics for physician burnout in order to 1) inform resource allocation to clinics with the highest need, 2) tailor process improvements to reduce risk for burnout and poor quality of care, and 3) lay the groundwork for expanding this model to other high-risk practice settings and provider types.",Development and Validation of a Prediction Model to Address Physician Burnout,10105225,K08HS027837,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,152582,0.006629302765136982
"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,10020962,R01HS027369,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,496734,0.01343604864292288
"Improving Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy for Gram-Negative Infections through a Personalized Smart Antibiogram Project Summary/Abstract Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most urgent public health threats. In 2019, the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that infections with AMR affect at least 2.8 million people and are associated with at least 35,900 excessive deaths annually in the US. This threat is particularly problematic among Gram-negative rod (GNR) pathogens in which high-rates of resistance to last-line antimicrobials have emerged globally, while our efforts to develop new antimicrobials have stumbled. To decelerate the emergence of AMR among GNR pathogens, it is essential to guide clinicians away from choosing unnecessarily broad-spectrum antimicrobials. An antibiogram, a facility-level summary of antimicrobial susceptibility data, is a common local reference tool which clinicians use when choosing empiric therapy. However, antibiograms have major limitations. First, little is known about how clinicians are currently using them when making empiric therapy decision. Second, antibiogram data is aggregated at the facility-level, and data may be skewed based on the type of practice or geographic area. Lastly, but most importantly, an antibiogram does not consider any patient-level factors. Therefore, there are strong, and pressing needs to understand 1) how an antibiogram is used by the clinician, 2) how much an antibiogram reflects the risk of AMR for individual patients and 3) how we can overcome limitations of antibiogram to optimize empiric therapy and reduce AMR. The overall goal is to create a novel, real-time personalized antibiogram (“Smart Antibiogram”) to overcome current limitations of antibiogram and to optimize clinician choice of empiric therapy for GNRs by providing a “predicted risk of AMR” based on a machine learning model incorporating patient- and facility-level data. This goal will be accomplished through (a) Master of Science in Health Informatics coursework, (b) a Mentorship Advisory Committee, (c) carefully selected conferences and workshops, and (d) a mentored research study. Our specific aims are to (1) Characterize the current use of antibiograms in clinical practice and measure the acceptable risk of resistance when clinicians make empiric therapy decisions for Gram-negative bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections within diverse clinical settings; (2) Assess the accuracy of currently-used antibiograms to predict the risk of resistance for individual patients in a large retrospective microbiology cohort for GNR infections; (3) Develop a machine learning model to predict the individualized risk of AMR for patients infected with GNR pathogens and validate prospectively and externally. This will lead to the future development of a personalized decision support tool (“Smart Antibiogram”). The expected outcomes of this AHRQ K08 Award will be the comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness and limitations of antibiogram, and the informatics toolkits to develop Smart Antibiogram. At the end of this K08 Award, the candidate will be well-prepared to become an independent investigator with expertise in AMR and health informatics, with specific strength in AMR prediction model decision-support system. Project Narrative Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among Gram-negative rod organisms is one of the most urgent public health threats in the United States and globally. By using series of survey of clinicians, retrospective cohort analyses, and machine learning prediction analytics, this study elucidates the current perceptions for AMR among providers and creates a machine learning model to accurately predict AMR risk at patient-level. The findings from this study will help create a decision-support system to guide clinicians for appropriate empiric therapy to treat infections due to Gram-negative rod organisms and prepare the applicant for a career as an independent infectious diseases health service investigator.",Improving Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy for Gram-Negative Infections through a Personalized Smart Antibiogram,10124644,K08HS027472,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2020,144640,0.01359270627213273
"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia. Computational modeling will aim at developing risk and resilience predictors, essential for early identification and intervention during a dynamic period of brain maturation.",Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers,9978131,R01MH119219,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Functioning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'childhood adversity', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'data anonymization', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'emerging adult', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'sex', 'social']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,787558,0.006183973525774967
"SCH: Prediction of Preterm Birth in Nulliparous Women Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Salleb-Aouissi, Ansaf Summary Prediction of Preterm Birth (PTB) has been an exceedingly challenging problem, predom- inantly due to the inherent complexity of its multifactorial etiology and the lack of approaches capable of integrating and interpreting large multidisciplinary data. It is a major long-lasting public health problem with heavy emotional and ﬁnancial consequences to families and society [ , ]. PTB is the leading cause of mortality and long-term disabilities among neonates. Most studies to date have examined 7 20 individual risk factors through univariate analyses of their coincidence with PTB.  Our previous work [NSF Eager 1454855, 1454814] developed predictive models for PTB based on non-genetic maternal attributes [ , 30 29 ]. A particularly challenging population to determine PTB risk is ﬁrst time mothers (nulliparous women) due to the lack of prior pregnancy history. An important question is to know whether factors other than history of PTB can be used to identify a nullipara patient at risk. Speciﬁc aims of the original project Our basic speciﬁc aims are as follows: (1) Longitudinal Preterm Birth Prediction: We will ﬁrst build a series of accurate prediction models for PTB using the nuMoM2b dataset. Such models will handle the challenges common to medical datasets including (a) imbalance in the classes, (b) missing data, and (c) disparity in data collection. We will achieve this by designing an objective function for Support Vector Machines that captures and corrects for these issues. Second, by leveraging the availability of patient future data, our Learning Under Privileged Infor- mation (LUPI)-based approach [ ] will signiﬁcantly increase the rate of convergence of the algorithms 22 and improve prediction with less data. Our transformative approach is well-suited for medical datasets that are both limited by the number of patients and inherently include the challenges mentioned above. (2) Combining clinical and genetic features for risk prediction: In this aim we tackle questions of causality between the genetic information and its various forms of phenotypic implications by leveraging the phenotypically rich nuMoM2b dataset. We will ﬁrst apply standard GWAS analysis to apply new insight regarding the changing patterns of genetic association as additional phenotypic data is accumu- lated as well as serve as a baseline. We will then seek to develop improved analysis of involvement of genetic contributions in PTB. (3) Clinical and social impact: We plan to assess the effectiveness of the methods in clinical practice by: (a) testing the effectiveness of the longitudinal models produced in objective 1 and 2 on existing clinical data at the New York Presbyterian Hospital. (b) building a sequential decision making model; this includes optimizing the scheduling of patient visits and diagnostic testing tailored for different classes of patients. Speciﬁc aims for this NIH Supplement We will extend the original aims to the following: (1) Interpret- ing PTB prediction models: we propose to explore the interpretability of our best performing models in an effort to understand “PTB mechanisms.” Our approach is to probe the most accurate models to assess which risk factor or feature are the most important and how they combine to lead to the PTB outcome. We will explore characteristic rules, along with inﬂuence functions to identify the instances that are driving prediction, (2) NetWAS Analysis for PTB: we will integrate NetWAS analysis into the study of PTB mechanisms and genetics. We will focus on the uterine expression levels available for automated NetWAS analysis from the uterus, and uterine cervix/endometrium, and integrate NETWAS- computed expression levels as features to the prediction models, and (3) Studying dynamic treatment regimes for PTB: We will investigate models that use reinforcement learning and causal reasoning to learn appropriate dynamic treatment policies in the context of confounding bias in the nuMoM2b data. This will in turn affect scheduling of tests and visits based on the individualized patient proﬁle. Broader Impact Over 26 billion dollars are spent annually on the delivery and care of the 12% of infants who are born preterm in the United States. A crucial challenge is to identify women who are at the highest risk for very early preterm birth and to develop interventions. Equally important, would be the ability to identify women at the lowest risk to avoid unnecessary and costly interventions. Our project has the potential to advance knowledge about this long-lasting public health problem. We will recruit female and minority students to this project. Research results will be disseminated through courses, conference and journal papers, and through undergraduate research and graduate students' theses.

Prediction of PTB risk has been an exceedingly challenging problem, in particular for first time mothers (nulliparous women) due to the lack of prior pregnancy history. Most studies to date have examined individual risk factors, genetic, environmental, or behavioral, through univariate analyses of their association with PTB, including GWAS identifying modest contribution of common variants across six gene regions.

"QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have exceedingly high mortality, driven largely by cardiovascular events. The rate of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the HD population exceeds that of the general population by more than 20-fold. Risk factors for SCD such as structural heart disease and conduction abnormalities are common among people with end-stage kidney disease, but traditional preventive strategies, such as antiarrhythmic medications and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, do not lower SCD risk in HD patients. However, medication-provoked SCD may be preventable, and, to-date, has been understudied in HD patients. Dialysis patients are often prescribed medications that have the undesirable, off-target effect of delayed ventricular repolarization, which manifests as QT-interval prolongation on an electrocardiogram, and can trigger fatal arrhythmias. Although more than 50% of dialysis patients are prescribed medications that can prolong the QT-interval (e.g. certain antidepressants, antibiotics, antiemetics), there are critical knowledge gaps about the cardiac safety of these medications. In fact, their safety profiles rest on data obtained from healthy volunteers and have not been explicitly evaluated in HD patients. By executing the proposed studies, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of the essential safety data relevant to the prescription of non- cardiac QT-prolonging medications to HD patients. In Aim 1, we will determine the relative SCD risk of the most commonly prescribed non-cardiac medications with higher QT-prolonging potential vs. clinically relevant comparator medications with lower QT-prolonging potential among HD patients. In Aim 2, we will identify modifiable clinical factors (e.g. dialysate composition and concurrent prescription medications) that may be targeted to mitigate SCD risk from QT-prolonging medications. In Aim 3, we will identify prescribers of higher risk QT-prolonging medications and associated encounters that should prompt medication reconciliation and decision support tool use. Then, in Aim 4, we will develop individualized decision support tools for QT- prolonging medication prescribing that integrate many comorbid conditions, HD treatment, and medication- related risk factors. This work will yield decision support tools that facilitate personalized SCD risk assessments and safer prescribing of QT-prolonging medications to reduce SCD risk among HD patients. Moreover, the decision support tools generated in this project will serve as the subject of future pragmatic trials testing the impact of tool implementation on cardiovascular outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hemodialysis patients experience a disproportionately high burden of sudden cardiac death. Medication- provoked sudden cardiac death (i.e. death triggered by QT-prolonging medications) may be preventable and has not been studied enough in this population. Our project aims to uncover medication-related risk factors for sudden cardiac death and develop clinical decision support tools that will promote safer medication prescribing.",QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis,9943546,R01HL152034,"['Antibiotics', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antiemetics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biometry', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrolytes', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Hemodialysis', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medicare', 'Observational Study', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Potassium', 'Prevention strategy', 'Publishing', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk-Benefit Assessment', 'Safety', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Testing', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication safety', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'personalized decision', 'point of care', 'pragmatic trial', 'structural heart disease', 'sudden cardiac death', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,606842,0.025933377635638095
"5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Summary Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion. Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study (NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority. This project will answer the preliminary questions necessary for a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods, that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview- based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,9984613,R01MH120089,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'metropolitan', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,572946,0.043188641237579824
"Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial PROJECT SUMMARY Overdose deaths have skyrocketed in the United States since 1999. The epidemic has prompted widespread federal and state actions, yet the number of people who die of an overdose continues to increase. In light of the accelerating and rapidly evolving overdose epidemic, new strategies are needed to identify communities most at risk, and to utilize resources more effectively to curb overdose deaths. To address these public health priorities, we will develop a forecasting tool to predict overdose deaths before they occur, and then conduct a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention to evaluate resource targeting based on these predictions. The study will take place in Rhode Island, a state with the 10th highest rate of overdose fatality in 2016. The study has two phases. First, we will develop a predictive analytics model that forecasts future overdose mortality at the neighborhood-level, using publicly available information and data from a multicomponent overdose surveillance system. This tool, called PROVIDENT (Preventing Overdose using Information and Data from the Environment) will be used to predict the likelihood of magnitude of future overdose deaths in every neighborhood across Rhode Island. Next, we will conduct a randomized policy experiment to evaluate whether targeting overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods at highest risk reduces overdose morbidity and mortality. The state's department of health will receive PROVIDENT model predictions for half of the 39 cities/towns in Rhode Island. Within these cities/town, the health department will work with stakeholders to target overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods with the highest probability of future overdose deaths. Interventions include efforts to: (1) prevent high-risk prescribing (through academic detailing and other educational efforts); (2) expand access to opioid agonist therapy, including buprenorphine and methadone; (3) increase naloxone distribution (through community and pharmacy-based efforts); and (4) expand street-based peer recovery coaching and referrals. Control cities/town will continue to receive these interventions, but without targeting to specific neighborhoods. Fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose rates in the control cities/towns will be compared to those that received the PROVIDENT model predictions. To achieve these aims, we will leverage a unique partnership between an academic institution and a state's health department, which allows for unprecedented access to and sharing of population-based overdose surveillance data. Our results will improve public health decision-making and inform resource allocation to communities that should be prioritized for evidence-based prevention, treatment, recovery, and overdose rescue services. If found to be effective, the PROVIDENT forecasting model will be disseminated to other states, which could adapt the tool to guide resource allocation and maximize public health impact. In sum, this project is highly responsive to a top research priority of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and directly addresses one of the nation's most challenging public health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objectives of this project are to leverage surveillance data to predict future overdose outbreaks, and to evaluate the impact of a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention trial to target overdose prevention programs to neighborhoods at highest risk of future overdose deaths. This study develops and tests an opioid overdose forecasting tool, which will allow other states to identify and deploy interventions to communities at highest risk of opioid-related death. This results study will significantly improve the allocation of resources to curb the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States.","Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial",10026087,R01DA046620,"['Academic Detailing', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'American', 'Area', 'Buprenorphine', 'Censuses', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Community Pharmacy', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Community Trial', 'Intervention Trial', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methadone', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Naloxone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neighborhoods', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Research Priority', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid policy', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'overdose prevention', 'overdose risk', 'peer', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'referral services', 'resource guides', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment arm']",NIDA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,654124,-0.0010231347171334906
"Precision antimicrobial stewardship for Clostridioides difficile prevention (PASTCDI) Project Summary Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an important healthcare-associated infection and a significant driver of poor patient outcomes and preventable cost. An existing bundle of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) methods of CDI prevention are limited by difficulties identifying high-risk patients most likely to benefit from interventions. Recently we have developed a machine learning classification tool capable of accurately identify risk of developing CDI in hospitalized patients. Here we propose adding and rigorously testing this highly innovative precision medicine approach to CDI prevention within a robust, real-world AMS infrastructure Objective: To decrease CDI incidence by implementing an electronic health record-integrated CDI-risk classification tool within a framework of precision-medicine AMS. Specific Aim: Measure the effect of implementing a real-time CDI-risk classification tool to guide AMS efforts for CDI prevention among high-risk patients. The primary outcome will be hospital-associated CDI incidence. We will measure outcomes in patients identified as high-risk by the risk classification tool, comparing a 24- month pre-implementation period with a 12-month post-implementation period using interrupted time series (ITS) segmented regression. Secondary outcomes will include antimicrobial utilization rates, CDI test ordering, hospital length of stay, total cost, tool use, and AMS satisfaction Hypothesis: We hypothesize that tool implementation will result in a 35% relative reduction in CDI incidence, which aligns well with the lower end of estimates of bundle effect in prior studies. Significance: While evidence supports the efficacy of AMS interventions for CDI-prevention in general, our proposal is the first to our knowledge to employ a precision-medicine approach to CDI prevention. This high- impact, precision medicine proposal, based on extensive, sound preliminary data has a high probability of success. Project Narrative Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an epidemic in hospitalized patients, and current prevention strategies are limited by difficulties identifying patients most likely to benefit from interventions. We developed a machine learning classification tool capable of accurately estimating risk of CDI. This study will use the tool to target antimicrobial stewardship CDI-prevention bundle recommendations toward patients at highest risk who are missed by current case finding strategies and investigate whether this will decrease rates of CDI.",Precision antimicrobial stewardship for Clostridioides difficile prevention (PASTCDI),10056575,R03HS027208,[' '],AHRQ,"IHC HEALTH SERVICES, INC.",R03,2020,37428,0.028081931524194793
"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9916670,R01HS025402,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2020,394737,0.008165905688048163
"An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. Project Summary / Abstract Diagnostic errors are increasingly recognized as a cause of pain, suffering and increased healthcare costs. Diagnostic delays are an important class of diagnostic errors. While many diagnostic errors occur in hospital settings, emergency departments visits may be especially important to consider because they treat critically ill patients and because most decisions to admit patients to the hospital are made in emergency departments. Thus, to enable a more complete understanding of diagnostic delays requires consideration of healthcare visits across a range of healthcare settings including clinic visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Delays in diagnosing infectious diseases are important to consider. For contagious infectious diseases, diagnostic delays increase the risk of additional exposures, potentially generating more cases. Second, many infectious diseases can be effectively treated, but even short delays in treatment lead to worse clinical outcomes. However, with the exception of a few infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis), diagnostic delays for infectious diseases are understudied. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact for diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. The overarching goal of our research is to investigate diagnostic delays associated with infectious diseases using existing data along with methods from the fields of computer science and statistics. While our research relies upon “big data”, we will also use clinical experts to review and contribute to all of our results. Our subject matter experts incorporate expertise in infectious diseases, emergency medicine, acute care, medical education, diagnostic reasoning, healthcare epidemiology, public health, industry, and professional infectious disease societies. Specifically, we will 1) determine the incidence of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases; 2) identify the risk factors associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases that are frequently delayed or have serious outcomes; and 3) estimate the impact of diagnostic delays in terms of healthcare costs and mortality. With our data, methods and clinical experts, we will be able to translate our results into future interventions designed to decrease diagnostic delays and improve healthcare outcomes. In addition, while our proposal focuses on infectious diseases, the methods and approaches that we will develop can be adopted to investigate non-infectious diseases and conditions. Project Narrative Diagnostic delays for infectious diseases contribute to worse clinical outcomes, increased healthcare costs and, for some infectious diseases, outbreaks of great public health importance. We will use existing large data sets along with machine-learning techniques and expert clinical guidance to detect patterns of healthcare visits representing diagnostic delays. Our goal is to characterize the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases to inform future interventions.","An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases.",10017203,R01HS027375,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,496235,0.01442815533855289
"Genomic risk in clinic care to promote health equity in New York City patients PROJECT SUMMARY Building on our track record in genomic research, clinical trials, and genomic medicine in diverse, underserved patients from NYC, we propose to develop new frameworks to bring genomic risk into clinical care to promote health equity. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are entering an exciting phase where they are poised to improve health outcomes for myriad complex diseases through enhanced risk stratification and clinical decision making. However, major challenges exist for clinical PRS implementation today. The vast majority of PRS have far greater predictive value in individuals of European ancestry than other ancestries, and issues of access to leading-edge genomic technology, research, and testing disproportionately impact underserved populations. To address this, Mount Sinai experts in statistical genetics and population genetics, with decade-long experience in building methods tailored to diverse and admixed populations, will work together to rigorously develop multi-ethnic PRS. We will integrate multi-ethnic PRS with standard clinical risk and family history information to generate genomic risk assessments for 15 common diseases. Drawing on Mount Sinai's century of experience serving one of the most diverse patient populations in the world, we will recruit 2,500 adult and pediatric patients from diverse and underserved populations into a clinical trial. We will estimate participants' individualized risk for each condition, and investigate the impact of genomic risk communication to patients and their physicians, including patient understanding and uptake of recommended risk-reducing interventions. We will explore attitudes, barriers, and communication preferences related to genomic risk assessment in diverse populations. Knowledge gained will be used to guide the development of a new multilingual patient-facing digital platform supporting patient education and communication of genomic risk. We will track patient engagement with their results through the platform, and assess the impact of individualized genomic risk assessments on patient-reported psychosocial outcomes and experiences. As of today, the path to effectively integrate genomic risk into clinical care in busy health systems, particularly for diverse patients, is unclear. Hence, we are partnering with clinicians, scientists, industry experts, and community stakeholders to explore a range of strategies to assess, communicate, and reduce disease risk, in order to maximize the efficiency of genomic medicine delivery, and promote health equity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Major challenges exist for including genomic information broadly into clinical risk assessment in diverse and multi-ethnic populations, and issues of bias in research databases, community engagement, and access to leading-edge digital technology disproportionately impact underserved populations. We will recruit 2,500 ethnically diverse and medically underserved NYC patients into a clinical trial to estimate individualized disease risk and investigate the impact of genomic risk communication to patients and their physicians, including trust and understanding of the information, uptake of recommended interventions, and psychosocial outcomes. We will work closely with our NHGRI, eMERGE, community, industry, and health system partners, and use lessons learned to inform future research and clinical strategies, maximize efficiency for genomic medicine delivery, and promote health equity.",Genomic risk in clinic care to promote health equity in New York City patients,9988767,U01HG011176,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Family', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Multilingualism', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Qualitative Research', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'Underserved Population', 'Urban Health', 'Work', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical research site', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'design', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health application', 'health disparity', 'health equity', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'mathematical ability', 'medically underserved', 'member', 'patient engagement', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'polygenic risk score', 'preference', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'social', 'tool', 'uptake']",NHGRI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2020,1401278,0.026439189710033433
"Development of a Digital Monitoring System to Reduce Risk of Hospital-Acquired Pressure Injuries Project Summary/Abstract The goal of the proposed SBIR project is to develop, implement, and demonstrate the feasibility of a Digital Pressure Injury Monitoring (DPIM) system to reduce the risk of Hospital-Acquired Pressure Injuries (HAPIs). HAPIs are a common, costly, and serious problem for public health. Ocuvera’s DPIM system will use data from three-dimensional video processing and custom algorithms to detect and predict risky patient behaviors as well as to automate nurse record keeping related to HAPIs. Algorithms will be refined, tested, and customized to different subtle patient behaviors that are related to risk of HAPI development. Ocuvera will create a user interface to automate record keeping and provide intelligent activity reports. To garner feedback from end- users, Ocuvera will deploy the prototype DPIM to a local hospital where data will be collected on a small number of patients during a short field test. Feedback will be gathered from nursing staff using the system to determine its potential impact on HAPI care. Information gathered during this Phase I study will inform refinement of the system and prepare Ocuvera for a larger clinical trial during Phase II. If successful, this study would show Ocuvera’s potential as an innovative technology with the ability to reduce risk of HAPIs and improve the standard of care, which represents a significant opportunity to improve outcomes for patients, hospitals, and nursing staff. Project Narrative HAPIs are a common, costly, and serious problem for public health. Digital Pressure Injury Monitoring has the potential to reduce the risk and severity of HAPIs. Reducing the risk of HAPIs among high risk patients will benefit the public through increased quality of life, decreased injury, and decreased cost of hospital care.",Development of a Digital Monitoring System to Reduce Risk of Hospital-Acquired Pressure Injuries,10082132,R43NR019556,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Geriatrics', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health care facility', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Nursing Staff', 'Hospitals', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Records', 'Nursing Staff', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Patients&apos', ' Rooms', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic wound', 'cost', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'field study', 'high risk', 'hospital bed', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injury prevention', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'meetings', 'member', 'phase 1 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool']",NINR,OCUVERA LLC,R43,2020,160570,0.004599526333471048
"Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment Diagnosis-based risk adjustment is widely used in the US and abroad for health plan payment, notably for Medicare Parts C and D, for commercial contracting and quality assessment, and in numerous state Medicaid programs. Yet the risk adjustment technology used for payments has not kept up with improved classification systems, larger patient datasets, improved estimation algorithms or recent theoretical and clinical developments. Our work will take advantage of the richer ICD-10-CM classification system, in use since October 2015, with over 5 times as many diagnoses as ICD-9-CM Codes. ICD-10 codes now recognize: left vs. right side for thousands of conditions, distinguish between initial, subsequent and sequela diagnoses, and incorporate hundreds of new clinical, demographic and biometric variables. Based on the ICD-10, more exact models can leverage increased diagnostic coding accuracy to reduce opportunities for gaming or discriminating against patients with conditions who are predicted to be unprofitable. Led by two of the three developers of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS-HCC) existing classification system, our team of physicians, public policy experts, statisticians and economists will comprehensively improve the accuracy of risk adjustment and predictive models using larger sample sizes, clinical judgment and state-of-art economic and statistical modeling. We will also expand the conventional regression methods explored, to include machine learning algorithms, constrained regression, and LASSO estimation. We will calculate a new “appropriateness to include” (ATI) score that captures diagnostic vagueness, discretion and suitability for use in risk adjustment models, and use this score to inform which variables are included in plan payment formulas. Selection incentives remain of concern in public US health plan payments formulas and may be costing Medicare over $5 billion per year (NBER 2017). Prediction and payment models from this project can reduce overpayment and offset plan incentives to skimp on services that attract sick people. To ensure that these models and formulas are useful for enrollees of all ages, they will initially be calibrated and tested on large commercially-insured claims data, covering ages 0 to 64. They will then be validated and refined for Medicare, Medicaid, and state employees using data from All-Payer Claims Data from five states and a second large commercial dataset. We will make development steps, statistical programs, and full details of the classification system and prediction formulas publicly available for comment, refinement, and use by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers. Project Narrative This project will develop new classification systems and new prediction and payment models that take advantage of the fivefold increase in diagnostic codes available with the October 2015 change from ICD- 9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Using data from two national claims datasets and five state all-payer claims datasets that collectively cover over 75 million enrollees, we will identify new, underutilized ICD-10 capabilities, create new clusters of diagnoses useful for prediction, develop new algorithms for using these clusters, and estimate formulas that predict spending, utilization and diverse health care outcomes for all ages. Methods and results will be publicly described and software posted on the web for use in risk adjustment and diverse clinical, financial, policy evaluation, and quality assessment outcomes by health care delivery system researchers, payers and providers.",Advanced Risk Adjusters and Predictive Formulas for ICD-10 Based Risk Adjustment,9965911,R01HS026485,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2020,399950,0.020844329792444948
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Prediction of imminent sudden cardiac death based on warning signs Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), a sudden catastrophic loss of the pulse, affects >350,000 in the US annually. Most will suffer sudden cardiac death (SCD) within 10 minutes of presentation, yielding a mortality rate >90%. Based on our recent work, we have proposed a novel paradigm for SCD called “near-term prevention”. SCA is often not as sudden as one might expect. At least 50% of individuals will have warning symptoms at some time in the 4 weeks prior to SCD, but these can be non-specific, so are often not acted upon. The overall goal of this proposal is to refine the identification of the symptomatic individual at high-risk of SCD, during this 4-week window of opportunity. We propose that a simultaneous examination of symptoms, clinical factors and biomarkers may identify individuals at highest risk of imminent SCD, which could enable prediction and pre-emptive management, thereby preventing SCD. We are proposing to develop a comprehensive risk score from two population-based studies founded by the PI. The Portland, Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (Oregon-SUDS, catchment area ≈ 1 million) is now in its 17th year and the Ventura, California PRESTO study (Prediction of Sudden Death in Multi-Ethnic Communities, catchment area ≈ 850,000) is in its 5th year. The resulting combined databank contains information on >7500 SCD cases and controls, with detailed clinical phenotyping and a biobank of plasma samples. From Oregon-SUDS, we recently reported that 51% (n=430) of 839 individuals who suffered SCD presented with at least one symptom within the 4 weeks prior to their lethal event. The main symptom was chest pain, but dyspnea, fatigue, syncope and palpitations were also recorded. Warning signs could represent an opportunity for near-term prediction of SCD. While these symptoms are common and may be non-specific for SCD, we hypothesize that a combination of specific symptoms and clinical profile could facilitate the identification of patients at high risk of impending SCA. In addition, the discovery of novel plasma biomarkers for SCD could have additional utility for risk stratification. We therefore hypothesize that biomarkers, when combined with specific symptoms and clinical profile, will maximize the likelihood of identifying symptomatic subjects at highest risk of SCD, allowing for early intervention. SCD remains a major public health problem with a critical need for novel prediction and prevention. Development of this user-friendly risk score for imminent SCD in those with warning symptoms would represent a practical and clinically meaningful advance for triage of patients for optimal care. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a public health problem of substantial magnitude and at least fifty percent of affected individuals have warning signs in the four weeks preceding their event. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive risk prediction score for imminent SCD in those that have warning signs, in order to improve the effectiveness of SCD prevention.",Prediction of imminent sudden cardiac death based on warning signs,9916644,R01HL147358,"['911 call', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dyspnea', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Oregon', 'Palpitations', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevention', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Subgroup', 'Sudden Death', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Syncope', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Wireless Technology', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'common symptom', 'community living', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'sudden cardiac death', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,816401,0.03190471169204655
"Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation Resuscitation from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is typically initiated in patients with ongoing ischemia and ventricular fibrillation (VF) or tachycardia (VT) that, even if successful, is commonly followed by repeated rearrest. Despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, survival remains poor prompting NIH to identify resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. Beat-to-beat alternans of cellular repolarization in the myocardium (repolarization alternans) is a substrate for arrhythmias, is rampant during resuscitation, and is manifested on the ECG as T-wave oscillations that can alternate (2:1) or as more complex oscillations. In preliminary studies, we observed in resuscitation patients and in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation from SCA, that rearrest due to VT/VF is preceded by T-wave oscillations that are complex; whereas, rearrest due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is preceded by increased T-wave oscillations that alternate. Accordingly, we contend that when T-wave oscillations are complex, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially discordant, which is repolarization alternans occurring out-of-phase in adjacent regions and is highly arrhythmogenic. In contrast, when T-wave oscillations alternate, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially in-phase (concordant), which poses no known immediate arrhythmia risk but is associated with mechanical dysfunction and, thus, PEA. Finally, in the absence of any repolarization alternans, risk of rearrest due to PEA or VT/VF is low. We hypothesize that during resuscitation rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA is strongly linked to repolarization alternans in the myocardium that is spatially discordant or not, respectively, and that specifically targeting the underlying mechanisms can prevent rearrest due to VT/VF and, possibly, PEA. In addition, the full spectrum of ECG T-wave oscillations can be utilized to predict no rearrest and rearrest from VT/VF or PEA and, thus, be used in the future as a biomarker to guide therapy and significantly improve outcomes. Our hypotheses will be tested with the following aims. 1) Determine the mechanistic relationship between cellular repolarization alternans and rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA in an in vivo model of resuscitation. 2) Determine if targeting the mechanisms of repolarization alternans can prevent rearrest during resuscitation, thereby gaining additional mechanistic insight. 3) Develop and test an ECG biomarker for predicting risk of rearrest due to VT/VF and PEA in resuscitation patients. To achieve these aims, we will utilize sophisticated instrumentation and signal processing in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation as well as in pre-hospital and in- hospital resuscitation patients. We have also established a highly translational collaboration that combines expertise in emergency medicine, cardiac arrhythmia, and clinical electrophysiology. Our scientific environment provides a unique opportunity to develop a better understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms relevant to resuscitation in order to develop novel and effective therapies. Project Narrative Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to arrhythmia is a major public health problem and despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, rearrest and survival remain poor. Consequently, improved approaches are needed, and NIH has recently identified resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. We propose to investigate the mechanisms of rearrest during resuscitation to develop novel and effective therapeutic strategies that improve outcomes.",Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation,9886863,R01HL142754,"['Acute', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency research', 'Environment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitals', 'Ischemia', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Public Health', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'epicardial mapping', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'rearrest', 'signal processing', 'translational model']",NHLBI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,668976,0.00789963512111059
"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation.

"Development of a novel community-based high-performance surveillance network for drug use PROJECT SUMMARY Surveillance efforts for substance use are failing us. They rely on outdated risk prediction tools yet risk factors for HIV and overdose are context-specific and are impacted by the interplay between patient-, provider-, and system-level factors as well as epidemiologic realities in a community. They rely on direct estimation methods for measuring prevalence yet barriers such as lack of access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and harm reduction services, stigma, criminalization of drug use, and unaffordable housing prevent people who use drugs (PWUD) from being counted. Additionally, they rarely involve community engagement and surveillance data are not disseminated effectively to communities to achieve maximum benefit. In the context of the ongoing overdose crisis and recent outbreaks of HIV among PWUD in Indiana, Massachusetts, Kentucky, and West Virginia, the failures of this basic tool of public health take on a new urgency. The number of efficacious programs and interventions to prevent and treat substance use and HIV continues to grow, but without accurate estimates of the size of the pool of people at risk of overdose and for acquiring HIV and knowledge of their specific risk factors, these interventions cannot reach their full potential. We cannot reach people who we do not know exist and are at risk. We, therefore, need to immediately modernize and upgrade our surveillance capacity to understand the size and composition of drug-using populations. I am proposing an innovative, interdisciplinary research program that integrates epidemiology, community engagement, biostatistics, econometrics, and information dissemination to create a novel community-based, high- performance surveillance network for PWUD. I will do this by (1) creating a community engaged research (CEnR) process around big data for PWUD; (2) building community-specific risk prediction algorithms for HIV acquisition, disease progression, and loss to follow up among PWUD; (3) using enhanced indirect estimation methods to determine the size of populations of PWUD and to evaluate the impact of interventions; and (4) disseminating findings and translating research into action. The data centerpiece of this program will be the Public Health Data Warehouse, an individually-linked database from more than 15 Massachusetts government agencies, which includes more than 97% of the Massachusetts population. Preliminary analyses with this database are underway and will be made accessible to communities in real-time. This project represents an approach that is entirely divergent from traditional surveillance techniques by using a combination of complex methodologies with the community always at the center of the process—from initiation to final output. This novel Massachusetts cOMmunity-bAsed Drug use surveillANCE (“Moma Dance”) Network will begin in Massachusetts, but will serve as a model for other states and jurisdictions as they contend with the failures of their own surveillance systems for PWUD. These efforts will translate research into action at the community level and have an immediate and sustained public health impact on the drug use and HIV epidemics. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will create a novel community-based, high-performance surveillance network for people who use drugs (PWUD) through an interdisciplinary approach that combines community engaged research, machine learning, indirect estimation, and dissemination science. Through this process, communities will gain a more complete understanding of context- and community-specific risk factors and the true scope of the problem. This network will facilitate rapid knowledge transfer to communities, directly informing clinical care and local policy decisions regarding service planning and resource allocation, as they seek to respond to the ongoing drug epidemic in the U.S.",Development of a novel community-based high-performance surveillance network for drug use,10054384,DP2DA051864,"['Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Dancing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Government Agencies', 'HIV', 'Harm Reduction', 'Housing', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Information Dissemination', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Kentucky', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Output', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'West Virginia', 'base', 'clinical care', 'community building', 'community involvement', 'data warehouse', 'econometrics', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'novel', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'programs', 'social stigma', 'surveillance data', 'surveillance network', 'tool']",NIDA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,DP2,2020,2670000,-0.083254961678105
"Improving the Accuracy of ASCVD Risk Estimation Using Population-Level EHR and Genetic Data SUMMARY Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASVD) is the primary mechanism for the development of CVD and is largely considered preventable by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Lipid-lowering therapy is the current mainstay of preventative treatment for ASCVD and guidelines for pharmacotherapy rely on the 2013 Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) for estimating 10-year risk. While these equations have been validated at a population level they have significant shortcomings that impact real-world patient-level effectiveness. These include implementation (i.e. time and effort for clinicians to enter patient data into a phone or web-based calculator), therapy changing sensitivity to highly variable inputs (e.g single time point blood pressure), paradoxical risk estimation for some patient subgroups that are an artifact of linear modeling (e.g. women smokers), blunt treatment of race (i.e. separately derived equations for black patients), and poor calibration for modern cohorts (i.e. resulting in the overestimation of risk). This project will attempt to address these shortcomings. First, portable tools for analyzing electronic health records found within the Rhode Island Health Information Exchange (HIE) will be developed for the extraction of PCE risk factors to enable the automated calculation of ASCVD risk. PCE risk factor extraction permutations (e.g. last vs mean blood pressure) will be optimized and the equations will be calibrated for the population. Next, EHR-system agnostic tools for extracting additional risk factors available within the medical record including symptom development, social determinants of health, and family history will be developed. PCE and non-PCE risk factors will be used for artificial neural network and dynamic Bayesian network modeling of ASCVD risk phenotype clusters to augment PCE risk prediction. Finally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data derived ASCVD genetic risk score will be integrated with the HIE derived risk factors to demonstrate the potential clinical implications of implementing an omics-integrated learning healthcare system. The project will serve as foundational training for the principal investigator towards pursuing a career as a physician-scientist in the field of biomedical informatics. Hypothesis: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk estimation is central to current lipid-lowering therapy guidelines. This project will test the hypothesis that population-level data-driven methods will improve the accuracy of risk calculators. Aim 1: Determine the Predictive Performance of PCE Risk Factors Derived from Longitudinal HIE Data Aim 2: Define Population-Based ASCVD Risk Phenotype Clusters Aim 3: Demonstrate HIE-Omics-Integrated Learning Healthcare System with Direct-to-Consumer Sequencing NARRATIVE Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death and the most significant contributor to disability-adjusted life years in the United States. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the primary mechanism for the development of CVD and ten-year risk estimation is the foundation of current lipid-lowering therapy guidelines.

"Developing Computational Methods for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistant Agents PROJECT ABSTRACT  Antimicrobial resistance is a critical public health issue. Infections with drug resistant pathogens are estimated to cause an additional eight million hospitalization days annually over the hospitalizations that would be seen for infections with susceptible agents. The use of antibiotics (in both clinical and agricultural settings) is being viewed as precursor for these infections and thus, is a major public health concern—particularly as outbreaks become more frequent and severe. However, scientiﬁc evidence describing the hazards associated with antibiotic use is lacking due to inability to quantify the risk of these practices. One promising avenue to elucidate this risk is to use shotgun metagenomics to identify the AMR genes in samples taken through systematic spatiotemporal surveillance. The goal of this proposed work is to develop algorithms that will provide such a means for analysis. The algorithms need to be scalable to very large datasets and thus, will require the development and use succinct data structures.  In order to achieve this goal, the investigative team will develop the theoretical foundations and applied meth- ods needed to study AMR through the use of shotgun metagenomics. A major focus of the proposed work is developing algorithms that can handle very large datasets. To achieve this scalability, we will create novel means to create, compress, reconstruct and update very large de Bruijn graphs that metagenomics data in a manner needed to study AMR. In addition, we will pioneer the study of AMR through long read data by proposing new algorithmic problems and solutions that use data. For example, identifying the location of speciﬁc genes in a metagenomics sample using long read data has not been proposed or studied. Thus, the algorithmic ideas and techniques developed in this project will not only advance the study of AMR, but contribute to the growing domain of big data analysis and pan-genomics.  Lastly, we plan to apply our methods to samples collected from both agricultural and clinical settings in Florida. Analysis of preliminary and new data will allow us to conclude about (1) the public risk associated with antimicro- bial use in agriculture; (2) the effectiveness of interventions used to reduce resistant bacteria, and lastly, (3) the factors that allow resistant bacteria to grow, thrive and evolve. A–1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Antibiotic use in agriculture is a major public health concern that is receiving a lot of media attention, par- ticularly as antibiotic-resistant infections in become more frequent and severe. This research will build a novel bioinformatics framework for determining how antimicrobial resistant genes evolve, grow, and persist in a system that has been affected by antibiotic use. This will, in turn, facilitate the development of effective intervention methods that reduce resistant pathogens in clinical and agricultural settings.

"A comparison of firearm-related intimate partner homicide in Texas and Maryland: Prevalence, identification of those at risk, and the effect of firearm regulations Intimate partner homicide (IPH) accounts for one-fifth of U.S. homicides, with the majority of IPH and nearly all (91.6%) of intimate-partner related homicide-suicides (IPH-S) committed by firearms. While much is known about the frequency by which IPH is committed by firearms, research is far more limited regarding how victim/perpetrator firearm access, ownership, and behaviors affect IPH and IPH-S risk. We propose a case-control study in two states (Maryland and Texas) chosen to provide robust interstate firearm comparisons, as well as demographic, geographic and relevant law diversity. We will collect case file (medical examiner, police, prosecutor) and interview data to compare the histories of IPH victims (cases) to those of a random sample of individuals who experienced non-fatal physical IPV in the past two years (controls). The study will accomplish the following: (1) Obtain a count of firearm-related IPH and IPH-S across multiple subgroups through triangulation of data from multiple sources; (2) Describe the context of IPH and IPH-S, including precipitating events, relationship history, and perpetrator characteristics such as prior suicidality and prior substance abuse; (3) Assess the strength of firearm access, ownership, and/or use as risk factors for IPH and IPH-S, attending to intersections with risk factors at the family (e.g., abuse history), community (e.g., community violence), social and environmental levels (e.g., state firearm policies, accessibility of social services); (4) Identify differential patterns of risk between firearm-related and non-firearm related IPH, and between firearm-related IPH and IPH-S; (5) Examine patterns of gun ownership behaviors and attitudes in relation to IPH and IPH-S. We will create a database that will combine data across current data collection endeavors, creating a foundation for future funding. Findings will inform future evidence-based, multiple-level prevention interventions and allow policy makers and practitioners to develop and refine risk-informed approaches to reduce and prevent lethal IPV outcomes.

"Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT For epidemiological studies, future clinical trials, and personalized patient care, there is a critical need to create a risk-stratification system for microbial keratitis. Microbial keratitis (MK), a debilitating, infectious corneal disease, is estimated to be the fourth-leading cause of blindness worldwide. MK severity depends on a complex interaction of patient, organism, and environment, resulting in a spectrum of clinical presentations and responses to treatment. Clinical presentations manifest with unique morphology features and clinical symptoms. Morphology features are visible in the cornea, and symptoms are measurable. But most patients are treated with non-specific broad-spectrum antimicrobials, an approach that increases antimicrobial resistance. This non-specific treatment approach lacks congruence with the unique MK presentations. There is a critical need for a new strategy to personalize treatments for MK and measure treatment efficacy. With quantified MK morphologic and clinical features, clinicians will have the tools to risk-stratify patients. The long-term goal is to develop rapid, objective, personalized treatment plans for patients with MK. This proposal’s objective is to quantify dynamic morphologic and clinical MK features using image and electronic health record (EHR) analyses and then build a risk-stratification scoring system associated with MK outcomes. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that morphologic and clinical features accurately risk- stratify patients for corneal and vision outcomes. Our premise is supported by preliminary data demonstrating that: (1) different organisms generate distinct morphologic and clinical features; (2) clinicians quantify morphology less precisely than image-analysis methods, (3) an expert is able to use MK features to tailor treatments; (4) the use of quantified features has improved outcomes in other diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, by helping providers to tailor treatments; (5) EHR data can be used to quantify and classify clinical disease features accurately; and (6) EHR data can be used effectively to risk-stratify patients. Aim 1 will develop objective image analysis tools to measure features of MK with existing clinical equipment. Aim 2 will evaluate MK treatment efficacy using morphologic image analysis and clinical features from prospective surveys. Aim 3 will risk-stratify patients with MK by combining image analysis and EHR extracted data. The expected outcomes are: (1) characterized databases of MK images and linked clinical data, (2) quantified MK features across a spectrum of clinical presentations, (3) performance-tested, open-source imaging algorithms and surveys to measure MK markers dynamically, and (4) a novel risk stratification model and scoring system. The resultant work will have significant value to clinicians. Clinicians can use practical, low-cost technologies and readily-available EHR data to quantify MK features and risk-stratify patients in order to tailor treatments. NARRATIVE The clinical management of microbial keratitis is imprecise and dependent on the expertise of the treating physician. Our innovative strategies will quantify corneal features using image analysis and available clinical data from the electronic health record. Quantified image features will be linked to health outcomes to give physicians new tools to risk-stratify patients and to tailor their management to optimize outcomes.",Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach,9865483,R01EY031033,"['Algorithms', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inflammatory', 'Keratitis', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Eye Institute', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Self-Examination', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Virulence', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'care systems', 'case control', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'epidemiology study', 'healing', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'performance tests', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'slit lamp imaging', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,410000,-0.010063190359649511
"Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic disabling psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent maladaptive reaction to the exposure to severe psychological stress, including trauma re-experiencing, hypervigilance, and hyperarousal. Our group has conducted seminal work to establish PTSD as a risk factor for coronary heart disease and autonomic dysfunction. A major concern, based on these findings, is that PTSD could increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) through autonomic dysregulation. This has important clinical implications on management of cardiovascular risk in PTSD. Two important metrics that are potentially useful for risk stratification are T-wave alternans (TWA) and Morphological Beat Variability (MVB). We have found in preliminary investigations that TWA may be linked to acute stress and PTSD, but additional study is needed. In this R03 application, we seek to collaborate with Dr. Gari Clifford in Biomedical Informatics to create a custom program that measures TWA and MVB with state-of- the-art signal processing in a recently recruited cohort of male veteran twins with high-resolution ECG data. We will also study for genetic influences with twin modeling and the effects of acute stress with laboratory- based trauma reminder challenges. Our aims are to 1) Examine the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA a) over 24 hours, and b) during trauma recall challenge; 2) Evaluate the potential role for familial and genetic factors by comparing the within-pair difference in MVB and TWA between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs discordant for PTSD. We hypothesize that MVB and TWA will be higher, on average, during a 24 hour period, and will increase during trauma recall challenge in PTSD subjects compared to those without PTSD. In addition, we hypothesize that the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA will be stronger within DZ pairs than MZ pairs, implying that there is a common genetic pathway linking PTSD and SCD risk. The development of methods to measure these factors, as well as the study of these important mechanisms, will accelerate Dr. Shah’s progress towards research independence, and help to establish him as an expert in the field of mental stress and SCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Posttraumatic stress disorder is a common and debilitating psychiatric condition that is associated with increased heart disease risk. Whether or not this means that it increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia is not known, but important for clinical management. To study this, we aim to examine the risk of PTSD and its symptoms on electrocardiographic markers of sudden cardiac death.",Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study,9915968,R03HL146879,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Arrhythmia', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional Stress', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Stress', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Tachyarrhythmias', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Twin Studies', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Veterans', 'Viola', 'Visit', 'War', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'heart disease risk', 'heart rate variability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'male', 'method development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'post-traumatic symptoms', 'programs', 'recruit', 'signal processing', 'sudden cardiac death', 'traumatic event', 'traumatic stress', 'vector']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,78000,0.03047763705664889
"Infrared Eyes(iREyes) Infrared Eyes Abstract Eden Medical, Inc. is pleased to resubmit this Phase 2 SBIR proposal to develop the “Infrared Eyes” (iREyes) imager system, an affordable and powerful mobile health (mHealth) tool for healthcare. The hand-held iREyes system will acquire both thermal and visible spectrum imagery to quantify healing via thermal indexing methodology. The iREyes will offer a user-friendly product with automated categorization. Diabetic foot wounds are common, complex and costly. Foot areas that are likely to ulcerate are associated with increased local skin temperature due to inflammation and enzymatic autolysis of tissue. Inflammation is characterized by the cardinal signs including redness, swelling, and heat. In addition to identifying inflammation associated with healing, the iREyes will also identify hot spots associated with repetitive stress to reduce ulceration and re-ulceration risk for people in diabetic foot remission. The iREyes will directly quantify inflammation pathophysiology implementing a powerful revised two-part strategy: wound healing via regional foot index analysis and ulcer reoccurrence risk through temperature asymmetry threshold analysis. The combined thermal indexing for healing existing wounds and asymmetry predictive analysis represents a significant breakthrough over current practice.

Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,9840518,R01MH113622,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Longevity', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Work', 'base', 'childhood adversity', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'laboratory experience', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'negative mood', 'network models', 'physical conditioning', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,573248,-0.015736097560569474
"Optimizing prediction of preschool psychopathology from brain: behavior markers of emotion dysregulation from birth: A computational, developmental cognitive neuroscience approach PROJECT SUMMARY: Internalizing/externalizing psychopathologies are identifiable by age 3, with neurodevelopmental risk markers evident in infants. Despite powerful implications for prevention, clinical impact has been minimal. We use innovative computational and epidemiologic data science methods to accelerate clinical translation of neurodevelopmental discovery during infancy towards generalizable risk prediction for preschool psychopathology. Our main objective is generating a pragmatic clinical risk calculator for public health use, the Mental Health Risk Calculator for Young Children (MHRiskCalc-YC). To achieve necessary power and precision, we create the Mental Health, Earlier Synthetic Cohort (MHESC), pooling multiple extramural cohorts at Washington University and Northwestern University to form the first clinically- enriched “synthetic” neuroimaging cohort for generation of neurodevelopmentally-based clinical risk algorithms (N=1,020, followed from birth-54 mos.). To maximize the risk calculator's clinical and research utility and cost effectiveness, we will generate a series of risk algorithms tailored to envisioned end-users, incorporating input from clinical stakeholders. Algorithms will also establish added value of pre-postnatal environmental factors in risk prediction, a crucial but understudied RDoC element. Aim 1 optimizes clinical feasibility and cost effectiveness by generating an MHRiskCalc-YC algorithm derived solely from commonly used survey data to optimize feasibility for future use in primary care settings. Aim 2 optimizes precision of prediction by establishing statistical and clinical incremental utility of more intensive assessment for future use in mental health specialty settings. This algorithm sequentially tests the added predictive value of methods of intermediate-high intensity (from direct assessments to EEG to MRI) for most precise, least burdensome risk prediction. The Aim 3 algorithm is optimized for future clinical research use in neurodevelopmental consortia, modeling the added value of MRI data to the Aim 1 algorithm. This mirrors “common” protocols of neuroimaging consortia and will also generate an empirically-derived best practices guide for consortia to optimize timing/ number of neuroimaging assessments. External validity will be established in the Baby Connectome Project (BCP). The MHESC capitalizes on an unprecedented, time-sensitive opportunity to accelerate scientific and clinical impact of multiple extramural activities that have been extensively pre-aligned. The public health impact of an infancy-based clinical risk prediction tool for preschool psychopathology has transformative potential for altering standard of care in early identification and prevention of mental disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Mental disorders are often early-onset chronic diseases, with brain and behavioral risk markers of common internalizing/externalizing problems evident in infancy. To accelerate translation, we will use multi-method imaging, behavioral and data science innovations to generate an infant mental health risk calculator for pragmatic public health use, derived from a clinically enriched “Mental Health Earlier-Synthetic Cohort” of 1,020 infants using established study samples (characterized from birth-54 months). Clinical prediction algorithms will deliver broadly useful tools for earlier prediction and prevention of mental disorder and parameters to inform when imaging methods will be most informative in large-scale neurodevelopmental studies.","Optimizing prediction of preschool psychopathology from brain: behavior markers of emotion dysregulation from birth: A computational, developmental cognitive neuroscience approach",10056737,R01MH121877,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Extramural Activities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Height', 'Infant', 'Interview', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Properdin', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Studies', 'Science', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost effectiveness', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early onset', 'emotion dysregulation', 'epidemiologic data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'mental disorder prevention', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary care setting', 'protective factors', 'relating to nervous system', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,1858980,0.025042973631034887
"Dementia Risk Prediction Pooling Project PROJECT SUMMARY  Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a major public health problem which is increasing worldwide. Currently, over 5.8 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's or other dementias and as our population continues to age this number will increase to over 13.8 million by 2050. Great strides are being made in targeted therapies which may be able to reduce the risk for dementia. However, identifying which patients should receive these prevention interventions is currently unknown and has been identified by NINDS and experts in the field as a critical area of research. Research done by our group and others has demonstrated that risk factor levels as early in life as the 20's influence an individual's future risk for dementia. Early intervention to prevent the accumulation of risk and targeted interventions for those at high risk could help to reduce dementia risk. Risk prediction methods can be used to accurately predict who is at high risk for developing dementia and target interventions; however, current risk prediction models for dementia have several critical limitations and none have taken into account longitudinal risk factor trajectories, a critical step to implementing precision prevention approaches to identify individuals at high risk for dementia.  In this study we propose to develop the Dementia Risk Pooling Project (DRPP) by pooling and rigorously harmonizing 12 prospective observational cohorts of middle and older age adults, multiple in-person assessments of clinical, genetic and behavioral risk factors, follow-up of greater than 10 years and adjudicated dementia ascertainment. The DRPP will be completed and made available to researchers via a cloud-based computing platform as part of the R61 phase of this proposal meeting specific Go/No-Go Criteria outlined in the grant. Then, within the R33 phase of this project we will use the DRPP to develop and validate an accurate and personalized, dynamic dementia risk prediction model which incorporates longitudinal risk factor measurements and easily updates as new measurements are accrued. This tool can be used clinically to guide treatment decisions and will be made available to clinicians. The aims of this project are important and timely, they will provide a risk stratification tool for targeted intervention/prevention for high risk individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a major public health problem.

"Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma SUMMARY: In 2016, nearly 50,000 adults in the US were diagnosed with oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and nearly 10,000 died from the disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as the most common cause of oropharyngeal (OP) SCC in the US. Although concomitant chemo- and radio-therapy is the most common treatment choice in patients with advanced OP-SCC, they have substantial short- and long- term morbidity and result in increased health care costs in patients who are cured of their cancers. These patients live with sometimes disabling morbidity for many years post-treatment. For these reasons, it has been suggested that therapy in lower risk patients might be de-escalated. There is also a higher risk cohort of patients in whom treatment with chemo-radiation may be insufficient, often resulting in distant metastatic failure. As such, these patients may require intensified therapies to improve outcomes. This is an agonizing choice for patients and their doctors, however. While patients do not want to be sickened by morbid treatments, they are obviously concerned about having the best chance at cure. Unfortunately, there currently are no companion diagnostic tools to identify which HPV + OPSCC patients are at (1) low risk of recurrence such that they can be treated safely to high cure rates with de-escalated therapy; (2) higher risk of failure despite aggressive high dose chemoradiation in whom treatment intensification strategies should be studied.  Recently, we developed a quantitative histomorphometric based image risk classifier (QuHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to predict progression in HPV+ OP-SCC patients; the current version of QuHbIC has already been validated in >400 patients and found to be superior to clinical variables in outcome prediction. In this Academic-Industry Partnership we seek to further improve predictive accuracy of QuHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as promising markers of unfavorable prognosis in HPV+ OP-SCC. We also seek to create a pre-commercial QuHbIC companion diagnostic test that is ready for clinical use in risk stratification in p16+ OP-SCC. QuHbIC will be trained on >700 retrospectively identified HPV + OP-SCC whole tissue slide images with associated long term outcome data and then validated on 440 cases from randomized, controlled, multi-institutional RTOG 0129 and 0522 clinical trials.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) computational histomorphometry from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve University, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in HPV+ OPSCC from Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic and, (3) Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company that will bring quality management systems and production software standards to establish QuHbIC as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for oropharyngeal cancers. Project Relevance: In this project we propose to optimize and validate a quantitative histomorphometric-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to better risk stratify survival among p16+ (Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related) OPSCC patients. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be either ""de-escalated”, left as standard, or even potentially escalated, depending on risk status.",Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma,9884742,R01CA220581,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Head Cancer', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International Union Against Cancer', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stage Grouping', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Universities', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'common treatment', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'economic need', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'pharynx squamous cell carcinoma', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,624150,-0.022269050783056986
"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9983016,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'risk prediction model', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2020,169005,0.007971774704393956
"Epigenetic Age Measures to Predict COVID-19 Symptom Progression and Severity PROJECT SUMMARY  The risk of fatality and/or severe complications due to COVID-19 infection is strongly age dependent. Data from the CDC suggests that those ages 85 and older have predicted mortality rates that is 100-fold higher than for those under the age of 50 and currently, 8 out of 10 COVID-19 deaths in the United States were in adults age 65 or older. While the exact etiology underlying this age disparity is unknown, evidence suggests that vulnerability may be due to changes that occur as a function of the aging process. This is further evidenced by the pattern of increased vulnerability among persons with pre-existing diseases of aging—cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD, chronic kidney disease, liver disease—suggesting that it isn't just chronological age that determines risk, but rather, biological age.  In recent years, our group has helped develop some of the most robust biomarkers available, namely the epigenetic clocks. These measures estimate biological age in a sample based on DNA methylation levels at hundreds to thousands of CpG sites across the genome. Not only do epigenetic clocks track with age in diverse tissues and cell types, but discrepancies between epigenetic age and actual age have also been shown to predict risk of mortality and incidence of major chronic disease, including those which appear to be major risk factors for COVID-19. However, in order for these measures to be informative for assessing COVID-19 risk clinically, or in the general population, 1) they need to be re-optimized to capture the aspects of biological aging specific to COVID-19 susceptibility, and 2) advances in technology need to be made to ensure lower costs and rapid turnaround.  This proposal aims to build on our team's multidisciplinary strengths to develop and validate a targeted, lab-developed, readily-available test to predict COVID-19 symptomology and mortality risk. If successful, this test will have widespread applications—from informing triage and treatment decisions in the clinic, to guiding social and pollical decisions when it comes to lifting “stay-at-home” orders for certain individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE The risks associated with COVID-19 infection are highly age and health dependent, suggesting that biological aging may be a major determinant for symptom severity and mortality risk. Based on our previous work in developing biomarkers of aging, we propose to develop and validate a novel, rapid, and affordable COVID-19 test to predict long-term response to infection, based on DNA methylation.",Epigenetic Age Measures to Predict COVID-19 Symptom Progression and Severity,10158592,R00AG052604,"['Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genome', 'Geroscience', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Hypertension', 'Immunocompetence', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infection', 'Lifting', 'Liver diseases', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Ventilator', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'bisulfite', 'cell type', 'clinical application', 'clinical risk', 'coronavirus disease', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'genome-wide', 'human very old age (85+)', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'older patient', 'predictive marker', 'preservation', 'resilience', 'response', 'social', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,139448,-0.037795771742265345
"Polygenic Risk Scores for Healthier African American Families PROJECT ABSTRACT  To advance the health and care of children, as in eMERGE II & III, CCHMC will assemble a birth cohort in eMERGE IV, ascertained on pregnant or recently delivered self-identified African-American (AA) women and their babies, along with the willing fathers and siblings. The eMERGE IV collection will be the inaugural effort in a new CCHMC initiative, a birth cohort of mother and baby dyads called My Genome and Me, Cincinnati (MGMC), conceived to develop an understanding of the genomics that informs health and disease risk, beginning at birth and continuing across the lifespan with dyads randomized at enrollment to genotyping with return of results as neonates or later as older children. Our eMERGE IV project will directly grapple with the ethical issues raised by return of results to families with different considerations operating in babies, siblings and parents regarding the particular phenotypes being studied. For eMERGE IV, as site-specific phenotypes, we nominate Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer. We will exploit the work done that will enable developing polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and genomic risk estimates (GREs) for these conditions in addition to the 15 others chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and anticipate developing consensus across the Network for the PRSs and GREs applied. The care of families will exploit the harmonization of the electronic health records between the adult and pediatric hospitals, which has been achieved with the Maternal and Infant Data Hub (MIDH) using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. For data quality control we will evaluate discrepancies between eMERGE IV genotyping and low read depth coverage (LRDC) genotypes (LRDC sequencing will be at CCHMC expense.) We will collect preferences and attitudes of our local AA community with respect to genomic results and return of results. We will develop health risk-reducing recommendations and return GREs with and without actionable PRSs to assess the influence of PRSs on the adherence to risk-mitigating recommendations. We will use SMART on FHIR (Substitutable Medical Applications, Reusable Technologies and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) through the electronic health record (EHR)-integrated clinical decision support (CDS)-Hooks framework to provide CDS to both the adult and pediatric EHR systems. We will periodically revise PRSs and GREs and return changes when indicated. CCHMC will provide LRDC sequencing from >17,000 DNA AA samples from children in the CCHMC biobank and ≥50,000 subjects in total for genotype generation and mitochondrial DNA variant analysis. Federated geocoding will be available to all eMERGE IV sites from CCHMC. To disseminate genomic practice within CCHMC, across the Network, and in general, CCHMC will provide services to advance PRSs and GREs for specific conditions, starting with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, migraine headache, and suicide. In sum, CCHMC presents an aggressive program use genomic medicine to advance toward better health outcomes focused on underserved AA dyads of neonates and mothers with their families. Project Narrative Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) proposes to join eMERGE IV by enrolling of local Cincinnati African-American newborn babies and their mothers with available fathers and brothers and sisters to develop predictions of their risk for Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer (along with 15 disorders chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and disorders chosen by CCHMC Faculty) using genetic variation, environmental factors, and family history. We will test whether knowledge of having a higher genetic risk for these disorders will motivate closer adherence to health recommendations made to reduce disease risk.",Polygenic Risk Scores for Healthier African American Families,9988603,U01HG011172,"['7 year old', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent Psychiatry', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Ancillary Study', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Attitude', 'Birth', 'Brothers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Repository', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethical Issues', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Fathers', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Fetus', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Mothers', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Siblings', 'Sister', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Sum', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biobank', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'data hub', 'data modeling', 'data quality', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'minority subjects', 'neonate', 'polygenic risk score', 'preference', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'programs', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHGRI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,U01,2020,1338768,-0.024427033867676164
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9979970,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'circadian', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social deficits', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,1261241,0.0029457438145358865
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9963329,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2020,128408,0.02187495354293035
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,10001486,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social determinants', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2020,192914,0.02375900468913015
"eMERGE Phase IV Clinical Center at Partners HealthCare Abstract: To enable the application of PRS development and implementation, our eMERGE IV proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank (>105,000 consented with genotype data on 40,000), clinical data in the electronic health records (EHR) for >4 million patients from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise, prior leadership in PRS development and state- of-the-art genetic analysis, established expertise in returning genomics results, and experience using information technology to transform clinical processes and assessing outcomes. We propose to build on our expertise to accomplish the specific aims: Aim 1 (Discovery): Hypothesis: Polygenic risks scores will allow us to stratify eMERGE subjects based on genetic risk for common complex traits. Using the largest available genomic data resources, we will calculate and validate new PRS for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and major depression across diverse ancestries. We will 1) compare and benchmark the performance of existing PRS construction methods in different ancestral groups, 2) develop novel statistical methods for robust trans-ethnic PRS prediction, and integrate PRS with established clinical risk factors and family history. We will obtain PRS from our network colleagues for an additional 15-e- phenotypes (total 20) with a goal of identifying high-risk individuals, e.g., top 2% of PRS risk Aim 2 (RiskInsight Report/ELSI): We will develop a “Risk Insight Report” with clinical risk factors, family history, and PRS with evidence-based recommendations for high risk participants (top 2% of phenotype specific PRS distribution) for electronic clinical implementation. We will assess risk communication formats in our ELSI Sub-Aim 1: To test the impact and interpretability of two mock RiskInsight Reports summarizing PRS as either (a) dichotomous (defining the patient as high-risk vs intermediate/low risk) or (b) quantitative (providing a numerical estimate of the percentile of risk for the patient), with linked clinical recommendations in both cases. We will then assess, through surveys of diverse HCPs and patients, the extent to which the mock reports are understood by both HCPs and patients. Aim 3 (Outcomes): Hypothesis: Physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based on eCDS of RiskInsight Reports. Among HCPs for high-risk subjects, we will see at least one change in clinical care after disclosure discussions with subjects. We will recruit 2500 participants for implementation of clinical PRS in RiskInsight Reports using a SMART on FHIR app for eCDS integrated with the EHR. The primary outcome will be whether any HCP took any action within 12 months after receipt of e-CDS defined by ordering screening tests, prescribing a preventive medication, or providing lifestyle advice. We will conduct analyses of the effect of disclosing results to high risk participants to determine how personalized results changed patient outcomes in laboratory values, risk reduction behaviors, or health care utilization. PROJECT NARRATIVE The discovery and clinical use of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for complex traits promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine. Our eMERGE IV grant will leverage a large Biobank and a rich electronic medical record to define the clinical impact of PRS derived from diverse populations and the clinical impact of returning these results along with family history and clinical risk information to participants and their healthcare providers.",eMERGE Phase IV Clinical Center at Partners HealthCare,9988785,U01HG008685,"['Algorithms', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Asians', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Family', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Japan', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction Behavior', 'Risk stratification', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'clinical risk', 'data resource', 'design', 'economic outcome', 'evidence based guidelines', 'exome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'polygenic risk score', 'portability', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'screening', 'support tools', 'trait']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2020,1216161,0.04749266888995601

"Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited. Therapeutic clinical trials in TBI have yielded disappointing results owing in part to the difficulty in accounting for clinically important heterogeneity within TBI. Early delivery of therapy is essential after TBI to reduce secondary brain injury, but unrestricted treatment of all brain injuries could be harmful. TBI stimulates a complex cascade of immunologic responses, both centrally and peripherally. These peripheral immune responses to TBI could serve as an early sensor of risk phenotype given the rapid, readily measurable response in the blood. An improved ability to risk-stratify patients on admission will streamline patient selection for aggressive interventions—such as invasive neuromonitoring—versus selection of those patients who can safely be observed reducing potential harms. Holly E Hinson, MD MCR is a Neurologist and Neurointensivist at Oregon Health and Science University where she cares for patients with severe acute brain injury. The objective of this application is to develop supervised learning models of actionable short- and long-term outcomes post-TBI and to interrogate if pre-specified immunoregulatory proteins add predictive power to the models over clinical features alone. Her central hypothesis is that immunoregulatory proteomic signatures improve our ability to classify a low-risk clinical phenotype after TBI. Dr. Hinson’s preliminary data suggest peripheral cytokine levels are associated with actionable clinical events acutely after TBI. The project employs a highly-sensitive, single molecule immunoarray (SIMOA) to detect immunoregulatory proteins complemented with an unbiased proteomic approach utilizing global discovery mass spectrometry. She will develop and assess a series of models incorporating proteomic signatures to classify: acute progressive intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 1A), acute neurologic deterioration (Aim 1B), and long-term outcomes measured by the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (Aim 2). She will develop these models in a well-defined, clinical trial population (development set), and test their ability to correctly classify outcome in an independent, prospectively enrolled cohort at OHSU (test set). Under a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors, the project will generate new insights into low-risk phenotype recognition and outcome classification after acute TBI. The proposed patient-oriented research project will be enhanced by a structured didactic program in the principles of predictive modeling and patient phenotyping (including proteomics), which will provide Dr. Hinson with the critical skills she will need to conduct independent, innovative translational clinical research in the field of neurotrauma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited—we lack methods to assess a patient’s risk of deterioration at admission. An improved ability to classify patients early after injury will allow us to identify those who may benefit from aggressive interventions versus those who can safely be observed. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and assess a series of predictive models incorporating immune proteins from peripheral blood to aid in the prediction of which patients are at low-risk for complications and poor outcome after TBI.",Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures,9975580,K23NS110828,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Admission activity', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease model', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Holly', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Ion Transport', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Series', 'Signaling Protein', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'TBI treatment', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'analog', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'placebo group', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'sensor', 'single molecule', 'skills', 'supervised learning']",NINDS,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,189108,0.013574767980912261
"Chronic Inflammation and Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-omics Approach ABSTRACT The etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) likely involves a complex interaction of polygenic, metabolic, and environmental factors including diet. Accumulating experimental, epidemiological, and clinical evidence supports a pathogenic role of chronic inflammation in T2D development. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these findings are largely unknown, and current evidence on the causal relationships between specific inflammatory pathways and T2D risk is inconclusive. Advances in omics technologies have led to the identification of genes and metabolites associated with T2D risk, but data on mechanisms and causality are still very limited. Multi-omics integration in the framework of systems epidemiology may provide new avenues to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms. To systematically investigate the relation between chronic inflammation and T2D, I propose to examine 3 Specific Aims by leveraging the rich resources in the UK Biobank, Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS), Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (SOL), and Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx). In Aim 1 [K99], I will integrate existing genomic data from the UK Biobank, NHS/HPFS, SOL, and transcriptomic data in the GTEx to examine shared genetic architectures between systemic inflammatory markers and T2D and whether polygenic susceptibility to chronic inflammation confers T2D risk. Meanwhile, I will receive extensive training in T2D systems biology and cutting-edge high-dimensional data analytics and bioinformatics. In Aim 2 [R00], I will integrate dietary and metabolomic data to examine metabolomic profiles mediating the association between dietary inflammatory potentials and T2D risk in the prospective NHS/HPFS and the SOL. In Aim 3 [R00], I will conduct plasma proteomic profiling in a nested case-control study within the NHS to identify inflammatory protein networks in relation to T2D risk, and as a Secondary Aim, integrate findings from Aim 1-3 to explore T2D-related pathways co-regulating at multiple biological dimensions. Findings from this project may improve the understanding of inflammatory mechanisms underlying T2D and identify novel targets/pathways suitable for early detection and prevention. I will be mentored/advised by an interdisciplinary team that includes Dr. JoAnn Manson (diabetes epidemiologist), Dr. Liming Liang (expert in statistical omics methodologies), Dr. Frank Hu (nutritional epidemiologist), Dr. Peter Kraft, (statistical geneticist), Dr. Qibin Qi (genetic epidemiologist), Dr. Towia Libermann (expert in proteomics), and Dr. Clary Clish (expert in metabolomics). The outstanding training opportunities with key leaders in these areas will provide me advanced knowledge and skills, positioning me for a successful, independent career as a diabetes epidemiologist with expertise in systems biology and integrated-omics. This project aligns with the NIDDK’s goal of integrating multi-omics technologies into diabetes research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to systematically examine the relationship between chronic inflammation and type 2 diabetes (T2D) by incorporating multi-omics data from several large prospective cohort studies. The proposed research will yield novel evidence on the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between chronic inflammation and T2D risk. Novel pathways, and specific genes, proteins, and metabolites identified in this research will serve as the critical first steps for future development of biomarkers and therapeutic targets for T2D prevention and treatment.",Chronic Inflammation and Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-omics Approach,10003234,K99DK122128,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Food', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos', 'IL6 gene', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Interleukin-6', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Limes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Nutritional', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Study of Latinos', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Technology', 'Training', 'White Blood Cell Count procedure', 'Work', 'adiponectin', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'diabetes risk', 'disorder prevention', 'genetic architecture', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'high dimensionality', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'response', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2020,89999,0.0024828764029347296
"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Karen Schliep, a tenure-line Assistant Professor of Public Health at the University of Utah. Dr. Schliep is establishing herself as a young investigator in women’s life-course epidemiology, specifically in a novel area of aging research—to improve our understanding of women’s increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (RD) and create women-specific interventions to mitigate risk and improve outcomes. This award will allow Dr. Schliep to achieve her goal of research independence by providing her support to accomplish the following training aims: 1) develop expertise in biomedical informatics and population-based research methods; 2) gain experience in the conduction of clinical cognitive health assessments; 3) enhance knowledge of modifiable factors affecting women’s mid- and late-life cognitive health; and 4) expand skills to independently lead and manage a successful research program. Dr. Schliep has assembled a mentoring team comprising a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Varner, an obstetrician and nationally renowned maternal-fetal medicine investigator with expertise in pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and two co-mentors: Dr. Norman Foster, a cognitive neurologist and geriatric neurologist and recognized leader in dementia research, and Dr. Ken Smith, an internationally known expert in population-based analyses and genetic/family epidemiology. Dr. Schliep has five advisors with expertise in classification modeling, ADRD neuropsychology, mid-life women’s health, longitudinal and survival data analysis, and chronic disease epidemiology.  Little is known regarding the association between HDP, estimated to complicate 2–8% of all pregnancies, and long-term adverse maternal neurological outcomes with similar inflammatory vascular etiologies, including ADRD. An estimated 5.4 million Americans currently suffer from ADRD, two-thirds of whom are women. As the US aging population increases, prevalence of dementia is expected to approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases by 2050. Why ADRD disproportionately affects women is not known. Dr. Schliep’s research objective is to develop classification models for the various dementia subtypes (including AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia) to analyze longitudinal, individual-level data to better understand how HDP may increase a woman’s risk for ADRD. Dr. Schliep will accomplish this through the following research aims: 1) increase accuracy of ADRD diagnoses within health administrative databases; and 2) investigate the association between HDP and ADRD, and mid-life mediating factors. The proposal’s expected outcomes include 1) a novel method to accurately capture dementia cases within large linked health administrative databases; 2) clarity on how HDP may be linked with specific dementia subtypes; and 3) skills, experience, and preliminary data for Dr. Schliep to support future studies identifying other sex-specific risk factors for dementia and mediating factors amenable to interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women have a two-fold higher lifetime risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and related dementias (RD) compared to men. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension, may contribute to sex differences in ADRD, with midlife experiences such as depression influencing the magnitude of risk. We propose to 1) create a model that can identify AD and related dementias in a large health administrative database; and 2) test the link (and mediating factors) between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and ADRD, which will serve as the first step towards creating women’s tailored intervention that can mitigate ADRD risk for women.","Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors.",9892855,K01AG058781,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eclampsia', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fertility', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Menopause', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurologist', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Database', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Environment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'administrative database', 'aging population', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'family genetics', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'high risk', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifetime risk', 'men', 'middle age', 'mortality risk', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2020,124188,-0.050773075563022414
"Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism Project Summary/Abstract According to the latest estimates, over 1 in 7 Americans will develop an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) over the course of their lifetime, and alcohol consumption is involved in nearly 4% of deaths worldwide. Thus, AUDs represent a significant public health concern. Currently, the best pharmacotherapies for AUDs require the treatment of 10 patients to observe 1 patient reduce drinking to healthy levels. For this reason, one appealing option is to identify at-risk individuals before they become heavy drinkers; for instance a family history of alcoholism is currently among the best predictors of AUD. Adolescence presents an ideal period to study these factors as it precedes the onset of AUDs but is also a time when there is a rapid increase in consumption. We have recently shown that neuroimaging measures can be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. relapse), suggesting it would also be possible to develop neuroimaging as a predictor of onset of heavy drinking in adolescents. Developing predictive tools to identify adolescents likely to progress to heavy drinking would offer the opportunity for early intervention and could potentially reduce the progression to AUD. Substantial evidence suggests that primary motives for problematic drinking are to enhance positive valence and reduce negative valence emotions. Further, substance use disorders are associated with altered activity in the insula, ventral striatum, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex when processing potential rewards and aversive outcomes. We hypothesize that individuals at risk for AUDs will show heightened response to aversive stimuli in the anterior insula and amygdala and heightened response to rewarding stimuli in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. We further hypothesize that they will exhibit diminished functional connectivity between reward, salience, and executive control networks. To test this, we will recruit 70 adolescents aged 18–20. Half will be have a biological parent with an AUD. The other half will be a control group matched on current drinking levels, age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All participants will undergo a functional MRI scan with a resting state run and a run during a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task that includes the risk of hearing an aversive sound (i.e. a loud scream). All participants will be followed for 6 months after the scan to determine levels of drinking. This study will provide both mechanistic information on risk for AUD as well as a tool to identify adolescents at greatest risk prior to the onset of problem drinking. This information could help provide personalized information about risk that may maximize likelihood of AUD prevention. In addition to the research goals described above, this is a training proposal that is designed to facilitate the transition of the primary investigator, Dr. Joshua Gowin, from mentored post-doctoral research fellow to independent, tenure-track research faculty at an academic institution. The mentored phase of the proposal will use a multifaceted training plan to improve Dr. Gowin’s knowledge base as well as his research and professional skillsets. Specifically, Dr. Gowin will learn new techniques in resting state functional connectivity analysis and in the cognitive neuroscience of emotion regulation. In addition to this scientific training, Dr. Gowin will gain experience management, teaching, and data presentation. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gowin has assembled a team of advisors from the intra- and extramural community with expertise in these areas to guide his training and development. This committee will include Dr. Vijay Ramchandani-NIAAA, Dr. Monique Ernst-NIMH, Dr. Elliot Stein-NIDA, and Dr. Susan Tapert-UCSD (see letters of support). The skills that will be developed during the mentored phase will position Dr. Gowin for success as he applies for an independent position and establishes his own research program. Project Narrative  Alcohol use disorders will affect over one in 10 Americans over the course of their lifetime. The early identification of individuals at greatest risk may provide opportunities to educate or provide services that mitigate individual risk. Therefore, identifying risk factors for alcohol use disorders is an important goal for researchers. One emerging target for research involves using functional MRI to study brain systems that contribute to risk. This project will explore the neural correlates of positive and negative valence emotional processing and how they contribute to risk for the development of alcohol use disorders. Better understanding of these neural processes could inform us about how alcohol use disorders emerge and, importantly, how we might prevent them.",Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism,10004489,R00AA024778,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcoholism', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Extramural Activities', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Loudness', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Review Literature', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Targeted Research', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'aged', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'faculty research', 'financial incentive', 'follow-up', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'negative affect', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'predicting response', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'underage drinking']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2020,249000,-0.05385243712363126
"Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening PROJECT SUMMARY The guidelines for initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are currently based on two risk factors: attained age and family history of CRC. Using the principles of precision medicine, we will individually tailor CRC screening recommendations based on the enormous knowledge we now have on genetic and non- genetic factors that predict risk for this disease. This strategy will reduce under and over-utilization of CRC screening, because individual risks vary substantially in the population, and over 80% of all CRC cases occur in those without a positive family history. In Aim 1 we will develop predictive models for CRC, based on genetic (~30M common and rare genotyped or imputed genetic variants) and clinico-epidemiologic variables (over 70 harmonized characteristics), derived from over 40,000 colorectal tumor cases and 46,000 controls. We will identify key predictors, and derive efficient personalized risk-prediction models for early detection of more treatable CRCs as well for CRC prevention, through the identification of advanced colorectal adenomas. In Aim 2 we will calibrate and validate these models in two prospective cohorts of >120,000 participants, including 40,000 minority members, diversity representing racially/ethnically and socioeconomically. These two cohorts (Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health and the Women's Health Initiative Minority cohort) contain genome-wide genotype array and comprehensive risk factor data coupled to data on screening and outcome data, allowing us to test the model's ability to predict risk for CRC and advanced colorectal adenoma across a broadly defined community-based population, and to personalize decision on starting age of screening based on individually specific genetic and environmental risk factors. In Aim 3 we will estimate the population benefit of our risk-stratified screening strategy, based on our risk prediction methods, compared with the current screening recommendations. This comparison will employ the well-tested decision model currently used to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force CRC screening guidelines. Accomplishing these three aims, our research has the potential to accelerate the translation of a large amount of genetic and epidemiologic research to patient care by predicting advanced adenoma risk, for cancer prevention, and predicting cancer risk, for early cancer detection. Genetic testing is becoming part of routine care and genetic data will increasingly become part of an individual's medical record. Using genetic and non-genetic risk-factor information in clinical and preventive settings is a critical step towards developing precision medicine. Our models will provide recommendations for individually tailored CRC screening and interventions and, because they are personalized, may also increase adherence, maximize the appropriate use of invasive technologies, and guide important next steps towards public health policy development and clinical translation.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, but current recommendations for initiation of CRC screening do not use important information on individual genetic, lifestyle and environmental risks for this disease. Our research, in large CRC consortia will accelerate the translation of several decades of genetic and epidemiologic research on CRC risks, to allow for personalized screening decisions, based on an individual's specific genetic and environmental risk factor distributions. This work will ensure that the most comprehensive information will inform novel precision medicine strategies for CRC.  ",Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening,9850545,R01CA206279,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'member', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized risk prediction', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'rare variant', 'risk prediction model', 'routine care', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,617785,-0.012228339805312266
"Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants PROJECT SUMMARY Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening, gastrointestinal (GI) emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. ""Leaky gut"", or intestinal barrier immaturity with elevated intestinal permeability (IP), is the proximate cause of susceptibility to NEC in preterm neonates. Early detection of leaky gut is essential to identify infants at risk for NEC to prevent and reduce disease severity. No clinical factor, routine laboratory test or biomarker alone or in combination have been described that identify preterm neonates with impaired intestinal barrier function who at increased risk for NEC. The goal of this study is to develop a rapid, non-invasive screening tool to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. We recently revealed rapid maturation of the intestinal barrier is strongly associated with clinical factors such as early breastmilk feeding, less antibiotic exposure and later post-menstrual age, and significantly higher abundance and metabolic activities of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Although the butyrate producing Clostridiales have been implicated in strengthening the intestinal epithelial barrier and reducing intestinal inflammation, it is unknown whether butyrate and potentially other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with neonatal intestinal barrier maturation. Our preliminary data revealed butyrate production pathways, in particular Pyruvate/Acetyl-CoA pathway are significantly more abundant in low IP subjects. In this study, we propose to validate a substantiated measure of fecal microbial and/or metabolic biomarkers combined with associated neonatal factors for a rapid, non-invasive screening test. We postulate that the level(s) of metabolic activities, particularly butyrate production and potentially other SCFAs via increased colonization of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium, are associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates. To address our hypothesis, we will leverage existed stool samples collected from a cohort of ~200 preterms (<33 weeks), for whom both microbiota (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and IP (urine non-metabolized sugar probes lactulose and rhamnose) are available, and propose 2 aims: 1) to determine fecal metabolic activities associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates <33 weeks gestation; and 2) to identify and characterize butyrate-producing bacteria associated with intestinal permeability in preterm neonates during the first 7-10 days of life. At the completion of the study, we will determine the biomarkers associated with healthy intestinal barrier functions and the discriminatory scheme for accurate classification of high or low IP group. Our long-term goal is to conduct a randomize clinical trial of rationally designed intervention for NEC early prevention. Refinement of the screening tool will identify infants with aberrant leaky gut, an essential prerequisite for subsequent rational design of novel strategies such as clinical trials of probiotics to promote healthy intestinal barrier functions to reduce NEC incidence. PROJECT NARRATIVE ""Leaky gut"", is the proximate cause of susceptibility to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening, gastrointestinal emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. This proposal will develop and validate a rapid, non-invasive screening test incorporating microbiome-based markers and associated neonatal factors, to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. The results of this study will support clinical trials aimed to optimize intestinal maturation and to reduce the burden of NEC complications. This study will address major knowledge gaps of the intestinal microenvironment in preterm infants, and ultimately lead to improved strategies to manage neonatal gastrointestinal health, improve children’s health and quality of life, all which are within the mission of NIDDK.",Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants,10018932,R21DK123674,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anabolism', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Butyrates', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Milk', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lactulose', 'Lead', 'Leaky Gut', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Necrosis', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Pyruvate', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Urine', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'early screening', 'feeding', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'insight', 'intestinal barrier', 'intestinal epithelium', 'intestinal maturation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mucosal microbiota', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preterm newborn', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sex', 'stool sample', 'sugar', 'supervised learning', 'therapy design']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2020,193125,0.016535577376142127
